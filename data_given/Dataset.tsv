0	5	Okay I was eagerly awaiting this tea since I ordered it, especially after the glowing reviews other people have written. Well I was not disappointed! I have tried this hot, cold, somewhere in the middle, smoothie, latte..etc. Basically I've tried it all with my small 30g sample (basic grade a.k.a classic with robust flavour). I like this best hot half matcha, half milk and marshmallows! The customer service is great if you have any problems or questions just ask them :D I also ordered with the tin since the bags aren't resealable. The small tin fits very nicely into my cupboard and helps my tea take up a lot less space! I recommend this to everyone!
1	3	<span class= tiny > Length:: 0:47 Mins<br /><br /></span>Maybe living in Seattle has made me a bit of a coffee snob, but this espresso does not really impress!<br /><br />See video for demonstration.<br /><br />It extremely easy to pull the shots from the Dolce Gusto machine and it leaves a nice crema layer at the top. The shot is not very strong, but definitely not weak or watery (like most the other Dolce Gusto pods which I reviewed). I still prefer my <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3ZF76 >Lello 1375 Ariete Cafe Prestige</a> which gives me the flexibility of using whichever beans I prefer. One of my favorites (besides some local roasters) is <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002E2FH0 >Lavazza Super Crema</a> which is a much bolder and full-bodied coffee.
2	5	Paying the little extra makes all the difference. Smooth, creamy, agreeable taste, and not too sweet is the best way to describe this great product.
3	5	As earlier posted, Lavazza products are some of the foremost Italian coffees. It's delicious to those of us who appreciate quality coffee.
4	5	...Pancakes! Biscuits! GRAVY! (try browning [frying] the baking mix in bacon fat [uncured] or whatever oil to make your rue[is that how you spell it?] then proceed...)  GARLIC CHEESE Biscuits!!!!! Cookies! (I use heavy cream in the batter/dough/gravy--INCREDIBLE! Helps me balance the carbs [hypoglycemic]) ETC.! Taste: ASTOUNDING! Texture: as close as you can get!!! I'm get'n hungry --gotta go makes some flapjacks! :) ?Did I mention Scones?!?! ;)
5	5	Just as good as the other Clif bars, but dry and crunchy. Tasty, portable, and cheaper than the others. Perfect snack.
6	5	I use pumpkin to help with my dogs' digestion - the fiber in pumpkin was recommneded by my vet.  It has worked like a charm for the past year.  Problem is finidnig canned pumpkin outside of the holiday baking season - so it's pricey in terms of the shipping costs.  But I only give them about a tablespoon on their food once a day so it'll last a long time.
7	5	I brown hamburger with a little onion in a skillet, then cook this according to directions in the same skillet with the hamburger(I use really lean hamburger, so I don't even drain it).  Add a little sour cream and frozen peas at the end of the cooking time and you have a great tasting all in one skillet meal.  This will feed two if you add bread and a jello salad (or one if it's a teenage boy).
8	5	Our poodles love this food. On Amazon the price is always within a dollar or two of the lowest price I can find it anywhere else. BUT, on Amazon I don't have to pay tax and with Prime I don't have shipping costs so it saves me the hassle of driving to pick it up. It is just an outstanding deal for us!!
9	5	I think the Naked Coconut Water is the best on the market.  I've tried other brands and find that this is the closest to taking a drink from an actual coconut.  It's truly coconut water without having to actually peel a coconut.
10	5	I REALLY ENJOY THESE BARS AS A MEAL REPLACEMENT<br />OR FOR ENERGY,THEY TRAVEL WELL AND I LOVE THE TASTE!!<br />THE PRICE IS GOOD TOO!!
11	5	Cooks much faster than other whole wheat or whole grain. Has a very good rich flavor. Our kids love it too.
12	5	I have so far ordered three of this syrup .tastes yummy. delivery is very prompt and its the cheapest i could find anywhere. will recommend to go for it.
13	4	For those who like a bold, strong flavored coffee. This coffe is a must try. For those who are new to K Cups try a variety pack first tp help you better decide your favorite coffee blends.
14	4	Nabisco's new snack cracker, Newtons Fruit Thins, is a good tasting snack that doesn't contain some of the worst ingredients found in many snacks.  I tried the Blueberry Brown Sugar kind, and enjoyed them, as did my wife and daughter.  They tasted good with a very blueberry taste.  While you shouldn't classify these as a health food, they are not as bad as many snacks.  I like that they are made with real fruit, whole grains, and no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />Three of the thin cookies add up to 140 calories, and it would be easy to eat many more than three, so a person dieting will have to control portion size.  Out of those 140 calories, 45 come from fat, and one of the 5 grams is from saturated fat.  However, no trans fats, which is good.  90 mg of sodium, so not too high.  The ingredient list has things you know, not a lot of man made things, so I like that.  It is a more natural snack.  Ingredients are: Unbleached Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Folic Acid), Whole Grain Wheat Flour, Soybean and/or Palm Oil, Sugar, Rolled Oats, Dried Blueberries, Brown Sugar, Flax Seeds, Fructose, Salt, Baking Soda, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />For a thin, fruit flavored, cookie snack, Nabisco's new Newtons Fruit Thins are a good tasting crispy cookie.  We enjoy them, and I like that they are not as bad for you as many other snacks.  If you control how many you eat, these are great for those with a sweet tooth.
15	5	Don't pass this up on baja bobs website.  It is amazing!!! I've tried several items by baja bob and so far they have all been good.
16	5	I only bought a dram of the Champagne flavored oil to try it. I used the dram of flavoring in my nieces wedding cake and everybody raved about it.  A couple of people really tried to guess what the flavor was, but they couldn't quite put their finger on it.  My sister and nephew both said it tasted like banana and that it was great.  But I tell you, it did not taste like banana.  It was awesome.  I can't wait to use it again.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPD84 >LorAnn Artificial Flavoring Oils, Champagne Flavoring Oil, 1-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)</a>
17	5	My wife & mom really like these.  They are really good & replace the breakfast rush meal
18	4	I have a lab puppy, and for any of you who have read my other reviews, I LOVE idestructable toys, as my puppy is a very strong chewer. After demolishing several smaller bones and puppy kongs, I decided to buy this bone, hoping it really would be good for a strong chewer. It has proved to be everything that Nylabone says it would be. He likes it, and has barely  made a dent  in it. There are plenty more play hours to be spent with this toy, and we've had it for several months.<br /><br />Recommended for labs, retreivers, and other big dogs who love to chew!
19	5	I made these bars for my four year old with many allergies using the applesauce recipe option. I didn't frost or use powder sugar on them them because we don't have a recipe for frosting that meets his hypoallergneic diet and he can't have powder sugar, but he enjoyed them plain. Since his allergies are a new discovery, he is used to eating  normal  food.  These bars weren't a challenge to get him to eat because they tasted like the type of baked goods he used to eat.  They were very moist and light.  We also enjoyed the brownies from this company!!  Can't wait to try their other products!
20	5	If you like a bold flavored cup of coffee you'll love this coffee.  It's bold but not bitter with a smooth, almost buttery finish.  No harsh after taste like some dark roast.
21	5	I love my Keurig coffee maker and the convenience of these K-Cups!  Since convenience can be costly, it's great to be able to buy the K-Cups in bulk.  The savings are substantial.  The coffee itself is always delicious!  My shipments always arrive quickly and in good condition.  Being a single mom, a full time college student, and a full time Realtor, I don't have much time for anything else.  Brewing my coffee in 50 seconds has made my tight schedule much easier to juggle.  I highly recommend buying these K-Cups from Amazon!
22	5	We love heritage flakes, not too sweet and not too bland and oatey.  The texture is great too, not rough and thin like some raisin brans.  It holds up well if you let them soak in the milk because you have to chase down a child.  They are the perfect source for whole grains.<br /><br />We love buying them from Amazon too because we save so much.  We live in Chicago.  The only place you can find them is at Whole Foods, already a huge markup.  Add to that Chicago city taxes and you end up paying 1/3 more.  Plus WF sometimes doesn't even have them or has them only in the smaller size.  Amazon doesn't run out.  Its subscription program automatically sends us the bulk size every few months.  Great deal!  Great program!
23	4	BBQ Pop Chips are a delicious tasting healthier chip than many on the market.  They are light and full of flavor.  The 3 oz bags are a great size to have. I would recommend them to anyone.
24	5	We were suddenly faced with need for eggless noodles.  Alternatives were tasteless, slippery  yolk-frees .  Then I stumbled onto these from Manischewitz and they have flavor worth my delicious home-made pasta sauces.  Now we don't miss the fresh pastas any more.  Who said healthy had to be boring.
25	5	My cat is almost 8 years old. Being the runt, she has always been a small cat, weighing about 7 or 8 lbs on average. I notice she just wasnt her happy little self and to my horror was down to just 5 1/2 lbs. Like everyone else here, the prognosis was kidney failure. There was absolutely nothing I could do to get her to eat the prescription canned food. Mixing with the old to wean her to the new didnt work. Adding water, making it warm, trying every kind available from my vet, I was at my wits end. She was getting sicker by the day eating just the dry food. Then after much reading of blogs, kidney failure webpages, etc, everyone raved about the Hi-tor food. I was afraid to purchase 24 cans of something she wouldnt end up eating, and my vet did not carry it nor did the yever hear of it. I figured my cats life was worth $25.00 and gave it a try. WOW, is all I can say! She IMMEDIATELY ran to the bowl, gobbled it up and asked for more! I have now began to feed her the canned food as often as she asks for it. She looks better, has had less vomiting, and has gone back to playing with toys and pestering her sister kitty, so I KNOW she feels better. If this only helps prolong her life for a little while, I know it was well worth the money to special order it. I plan on taking a few cans to my vet so they can consider carrying it in the future. Thank you Hi-Tor! Now please make a dry kidney food!
26	5	These are great, but my dog likes to augment them with other types of bones
27	5	This is a wonderful oil.  I am not able to get Sunflower oil anywhere locally unless I want to pay a huge price for a small quantity.  Even with the cost of shipping, I would purchase this again.
28	5	I have never really cared much for salads, but went on a diet that required me to eat a lot of spinach. I mixed the spinach with greens, onions, and yellow peppers and added this vinegar with a little olive oil and it is so good that I feel like I am having a dessert! I have only used it as a salad dressing, but am sure it would be great used in various ways. (I saw someone say it was good to dip strawberries)
29	1	I've been eating these as part of a low carb diet, and thinking they are too good to be true because they are so good. Estimating the amount, I plugged the ingredients into an online recipe nutrition calculator and I could not come close to the amount of net carbs or calories that are on the label. That's when I decided to do a web search on the company and I found that a news channel in NY had Eat Rite pizzas lab tested, and found that the nutritional info was way off.<br /><br />No wonder these pizzas were so good... it's because they are just  real  pizzas. Only really expensive. Don't buy.
30	5	I wasn't expecting much of this product given that I generally don't like Green Mountain Coffee, but to my surprise this was a very good tasting dark roast. It has a strong flavor and nice aroma but not too bitter or watered down. It also had a good pricing for the 18 pack compared to other products. I think I'm going to purchase this again.<br /><br />*Note: I drink my coffee black so my tasting of the flavor is exact.
31	5	Can't find these anywhere except for the movie theater. Walmart had like 7 flavors except this one.  6 pack is totally worth it.  Great value.
32	4	I made this in a regular coffee maker made for pods.<br />I thought it was find - it reminded me most of a breakfast blend.  It was very smooth with what seemed like a normal dose of caffeine.  It's not at all bitter - unfortunately, around here, we LIKE bitter in our beer and coffee, so I probably would not buy it again.  If, however, you like something like Maxwell House Breakfast Blend with a mild flavor, but a bit more caffeine, you'll probably really like it.<br />I love that it is fair trade.  I had to use scissors to open the packets.
33	5	So glad they still have these in Germany!!! Wish they would bring them back to the US. Bought it as a gift for my best friend. She loved them!!!
34	4	Finally a product in a price range that I can say WoW about!If your looking for a product that delivers positive results that isnt 80 to 100$, I swear this is it. I have combo skin and some light scars around mouth/chin area from acne. The results Ive had from using this is diminished scars (not erased scars), clearer skin. It keeps there appearance down. However this product is mild if your just starting masks or have perfect skin already...recommended.
35	1	I was disappointed in the packaging as the Oats were in a simple plastic bag that was overfilled and a plain cardboard box that barely held together.  When I opened the package, the oats spilled all over because the plastic bag ripped from the excessive bulge .  I had to do a bunch of unnecessary cleanup that could have easily been avoided with proper packaging.  Will not order any more oats unless vendor sends me a complementary package.
36	5	Oh my gosh-if you like dark pretzels you have to try these!! Delicious.  You get ALOT for the money and they are very fresh!! I'm hooked. Try them you won't be disappointed.
37	5	Really nice cookies.  They go with either coffee or tea, or just as a snack.
38	4	I have yet to find a Bob's Red Mill product i don't like but this cereal is one of my favorites.  the directions are easy, and the only suggestion i'd make to change it is to add some fruit for flavor and some chopped walnuts for texture.  i prefer to add dried cranberries myself, but my wife likes it with dried apricots.<br /><br />it cooks faster than oatmeal and really sticks to your ribs while warming you up for the day.
39	5	This is my current favorite tea.  I do add some stevia to it to sweeten it and bring out the flavor.  I signed up for auto shipment...that's how much i love this tea.  The healthiness of green tea, with the slight taste of mango...who wouldn't love that?
40	3	These cookies were good for a packaged cookie. Of course, with three kids, cookies of any sort are not long in the house. Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />1. Crumbled cookies: I didn't have the problems with crumbled cookies that other reviewers had. They held together nicely. However, getting baked goods shipped to you always has a risk, especially during times of temperature extremes like summer. So, that might be a problem in some cases.<br /><br />2. Taste: these cookies are no comparison to a homemade cookie, but what packaged cookie is? The taste is about the same as a regular Chips Ahoy Cookie if you added chocolate frosting to it. They do taste like a commercially processed food. Most likely because they are.<br /><br />The chocolate filling adds an additional flavor to the normal Chips Ahoy taste. It's good, but not super exciting.<br /><br />3. Gooey-ness: The picture and label hints that you're looking at a fudgy-gooey center. The package I had was good, but the chocolate was more a disc of chocolate. It was not hard, but it wasn't the runny-chewy that it looks like.<br /><br />4. Overall: these cookies weren't bad, but they also aren't something extremely exciting.<br /><br />These are ok if you want to keep a package of cookies laying around.
41	5	Tully's house blend coffee is a bold coffee that isn't bitter but delivers good coffee flavor.  I use the K-cups for that perfect cup of coffee every time.  I was looking for a replacement for the Kona blend coffee since it has become very difficult to find and the prices have sky rocketed to ridiculousness when you do find it.  This house blend has been a good replacement.
42	5	I felt deeply motivated to say that I have to disagree with the reviewer who said these smell like old ketchup. I just didn't get that at all. To me, they smell like what they are. Disclaimer: I can't say I even know what old ketchup smells like. I'm kidding, but I do disagree and if I had read that review before trying, I may not have tried them.<br /><br />Anywho, found these at a local grocery store first. Took a chance on them and we were very surprised about how good they are, so I came here to buy them in bulk (quite a bit cheaper). They taste fresh and they don't leave me with a heavy feeling like the  andy capps  (or however you spell that) hot fries do. Super good snack and quite a bit heather than the others for sure. Every one we've shared them with ends up eating a bunch.
43	5	Honestamente este aceite de coco, no tiene que envidiarle nada al  Barlean's Organic Oil , ambos tienen el saber muy similar la unica diferencia que encontre fue el precio.
44	4	I enjoyed this hot sauce.  It does have a kick to it (not a burn your mouth/throat kick - more like a low&slow burn).  I found the flavor to be great & will use this liberally to make hot wings (my 14 year old son & his friends loved it also).  If you really want an extreme burn with good flavor try the after burner sauce from a company called Son-in-law out of Michigan.
45	5	My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she's eating something thats good for her.
46	4	I really love this tea, it's my favorite. I like the mildly sweet flavor, and it is a medium strength tea, not too weak and not too strong. I haven't tried the caffeinated version yet, but I hope to in the future. Unfortunately I have to rate this 4 stars as one of the boxes I received was filled with English Breakfast Tea instead of Earl Grey. This was probably a packing issue with the manufacturer as the box was correct (Twinings Earl Grey). I received a refund, but it was still inconvenient and I hope it doesn't happen again.
47	5	This coffee is absolutely fantastic. The varieties are superb and the aroma is intoxicating. The price can't be beat for such high quality roasts as these. Who made this stuff? Ohhh, Brooklyn Bean Roastery, yeah, love this stuff, Fuggedaboudit.
48	5	This is the best hot chocolate ever!  Low calories, fat & carbs.  Mix it with fat free cream and it is truly out of this world!
49	5	The chocolate is intense and wonderful.  The hint of orange flavor and the peels mixed in the chocolate adds to the enjoyment of eating this confection.  One thing, though, even though the package says milk chocolate, this is actually a dark chocolate bar.
50	5	I popped my first batch and I have to say this does taste pretty darn close to what you'd find at a movie theatre.  Everything seems to be measured well enough that you don't see any grease stains when using a popcorn bag but you still get that distinct taste and flavor.  The popcorn tasted fresh but there are no expiration dates or lot numbers anywhere on the packaging so I'm not sure how they can trace anything if there's a bad batch. They don't have any ISO 9001 markings so I'm assuming there is no quality oversight of these.<br /><br />I have zero real complaints about the popcorn or the taste, but I don't think they should add some sort of traceability.
51	1	I have  a shih tzu Chihuahua mix and he will not eat these. I was surprised since they got great reviews..maybe my moms cat will eat them.
52	5	These cookies are fantastic - I don't know if it is the center or the crispy cookie outside but together, perfection.<br /><br />I happened on them while traveling to Australia - now when I get a chance to get to Oz, one of my first stops is at the grocery store.<br /><br />Also try Cherry Ripe Candy bars and Ice cream bars - as close to heaven as most of us will get.
53	4	I tried this food for free through BzzAgent. My dog is about a year old but VERY active, so have him on puppy food still because he's smallish and has trouble keeping weight on. He is allergic to something, I'm not sure if it's environmental or food, but he didn't have a reaction to this food. This is corn-free so I'm wondering if that's what he's allergic to.<br />He did very well on it, and had nice solid stools and wasn't excessively flaky or itchy. He tends to bolt his food so the very small pieces weren't that great. He wouldn't chew it and then ended up vomiting afterward; I had to give him small amounts at a time. I'd rather they had kibble size options, but I'm being picky now.<br />I'm not thrilled that the second ingredient is wheat, but at least it's not corn. Sagan seemed to do well on it. If it was less expensive than the food I have him on now (that he also does very well on), I'd have no problem using or recommending this food.
54	3	It is beautiful, but there were a few cookies that where stale.  They immediately sent a care package as compensation.  Their service is good and they care about their customers.
55	4	After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters.
56	5	Love these plums and have two or three each morning. I wish they were available in one of my local food outlets but ????<br /><br />Other companies used to offer them (Delmonte?)but no longer do so.<br /><br />Not sure how oregon decides what products will be offered in various stores. e.g. My Stop & Shop carries other Oregon products such as Cheerries for pie filling etc. but not these Purple plums?
57	5	This tea is one of my favorites.  It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.<br /><br />Three warnings for this tea:<br /><br />1.  If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.  I think this is comparable to flavored water in the intensity of the flavor, though it would be unfair to compare this to the fake chemical flavor of a propel water bottle!<br /><br />2.  It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.  It tastes like it would be lovely, but the flavor oil leaves a film on the top that I find unappetizing.<br /><br />Enjoy your tea!
58	2	I bought this to try out when it went on sale for $15/box here at Amazon.  The flavor is decent, but it really is just instant coffee with a few grounds packaged into a K cup.  For way less money and packaging, you can get instant coffee and just use the Keurig to heat the water.
59	5	Amazon had a special promotional sale price during the month of March, 2011, and I took advantage of this sale numerous times during the month as Eight O'Clock Colombian Coffee is my favorite, plus have you priced coffee at the grocery stores recently?  Besides the sale price, I did not have to pay sales tax nor shipping charges.
60	5	I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called  premium  brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.   Lamb meal  contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.
61	5	My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a  good  dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought  stuff , but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!
62	5	My small dogs LOVE this product.  It's a bargain at these prices, which you already know if you've purchased it previously at your local store.  There's about 15-20 pieces in this package, an equivalent amount that would cost 4 times as much if purchased at a pet store. The few moments of stink this product has disappears and isn't much of a bother.  It takes hours for the little chewers to make their way through one pizzle stick, though they work at it diligently and contentedly.  Wonderful find!
63	1	Sweet, but almost no rhubard flavor.  Bargain supermarket brands have more flavor.  I will not be buying this product again.  I will not be buying this product again.
64	3	I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go.
65	5	These are the best chips ever!  The BBQ ones are on the spicy side, which I really like.  I used to think baked chips were good until I tried Pop Chips.  There is no comparison!  The baked chips are thin, flat and tasteless next to these.  If you want a chip you can really sink your teeth into you will not be disappointed!
66	5	I drank this tea after my first trimester of pregnancy for its numerous health benefits.  It is pure red raspberry leaves and great organic package.  They are  not individually packaged, they come in a foil lined paper lije package and there are no strings or tags, just steep add agave or honey to sweeten...it is a little bitter but not bad and drink!
67	5	After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.  I've tried several flavors, and they like them all.  They are excited again at meal time.  The best benefit is that the  tummy problems  are so much better.
68	5	We love Crema e Gusto for breakfast. It has the smooth and intense flavor of the coffee in Europe; no bitter or over roasted. There is nothing better.
69	5	Not only is this really good saffron at a price far lower than I'm accustomed to paying, but it's also packaged well, in cute little acrylic boxes that make it easy to share with others (as well as keeping it fresh until I'm ready to use it).  I'm looking forward to buying some to slip into Christmas stockings this year - my family members love to give and get fancy foods and ingredients for cooking, and I know they'll be thrilled with this.
70	5	We love our Keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees.  Recently discovered Wolfgang Puck's new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried.  This one is smooth with a great flavor, no bite.  We would purchase this again.
71	4	We drink a lot of Crystal Light as a break from soft drinks.  We thought we would try their new Mocktail flavors and give them a chance.  This Margarita flavor is not bad.  It actually tastes like a margarita with a couple of good exceptions, no sugar, low sodium and it has only 5 calories for 8 ounces.<br /><br />Each canister has 5 plastic pouches and each pouch makes 2 quarts.  Mix it up and serve it cold with ice or refrigerate for the best flavor.<br /><br />Crystal Light is a good low calorie drink and the broad flavor mix helps keep them tasting good.  We found this margarita taste to be better than the Appletini flavor.  I still like some of the original Crystal light flavors more but this is good for a change.  It tastes as good as some other more expensive margarita mixes.  I looked at a bottle of one of the famous brands that has 100 calories for 8 ounces and 25 sugars.  That is a huge difference!<br /><br />Try it you will like it!
72	2	Been a Spam fan for over 40 yrs. & thought the Bacon Flavored version would be something different. Sorry to say that it just didn't have any, or very little, bacon flavor. Tasted like a can of regular Spam. Called Hormel Customer Service to voice my concerns and got a curt response of  we can't satisfy every customer's tastes , end of conversation. Thought they'd be a bit more receptive to a long time customer's comments but they weren't. If you like regular Spam you'll like this, just don't expect much of a Bacon flavor.
73	5	Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies taste just like the cookies my grandma used to bake. Great to take as a quick breakfast since it is made with whole grain Quaker Oats.
74	5	My husband I recently ate at an outside cafe in Geneva, IL.  It was late afternoon so we just wanted something light to eat with a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheese plate that include a choice of three cheese.  One of the choices on the menu was a blue cheese listed as  Pointed Reyes Original Farmstead Blue .  It was exceptionally good completly outshining the sharp cheedar and the mild Wisconsin Gouda. So much so that I asked to take a copy of the menu home so I could order the cheese on the internet.  Not as easy as I thought, but I did find it on Amazon and ordered it, after I corrected the spelling to  Point  Reyes rather than  Pointed  Reyes Blue Cheese.<br />  It was delievered in a couple of days intact and as delicious as I remembered. This really is a standout blue cheese especially if you like a tangy sharp blue cheese.  It is creamy but not overpowering and does not have the musky taste that some blue cheeses do. The only downside was the cost of shipping.  The cheese was $18.00 for a pound but the shipping was unexpectely high at $26.00.  The combined cost makes for a very expensive cheese.  I'm sure I will enjoying eating this blue cheese and make certain that I perserve every valuble bite of it until it is gone.
75	5	Most stores have discountinued this hot sauce, it's very hard to find.  I'm cajun from Louisiana and this is the best hot sauce I ever tasted. Hope it stays on the market, I won't buy any other.
76	5	It shouldn't be over $4 a pack for these fish, at my local supermarket I get it for like $3.30.  If only they made the price affordable (normal), I would buy like 100 of these. But it is really good, especially if you don't like to cook and are a young single person.
77	5	This is one of my favorite K Cups out now.Very good cappuccino,and the price is right.I highly recommend this to anybody!!!
78	5	As the 5 stars used as my personal judgement call on this product, I found the licorice to be just as good as I expected based on others GOOD reviews. The product arrived quickly, soft, fresh and very tasty.( as long as one enjoys black licorice that is).
79	3	If you've ever cooked chocolate too long you know the smell of burned chocolate.  It isn't a terribly bad odor, it's just not as pleasant as chocolate should be.  I tried this cereal twice and both times that burned chocolate smell started about 30 seconds into the cooking time.<br /><br />The oatmeal overall is not as sweet as I expected and other than the slight taste of burned chocolate, it is very bland, as in plain, unflavored, oatmeal.  Adding sweetener didn't help; it became just sweet but still flavorless.  I guess I expected a chocolate-chip-oatmeal-cookie flavor; unfortunately, this isn't.<br /><br />I am very glad I purchased only one box from my local grocery store rather than buying in bulk here, although it was the prior reviews of this flavor here which convinced me to try it in the first place.<br /><br />One interesting note: In spite of the chocolate chips, this flavor actually has fewer calories than other flavors of Quaker Instant Oatmeal.  It has only 130 calories per serving, while Cinnamon & Spice, Cinnamon Roll, and Maple & Brown Sugar (three of my favorites) all have 160 calories per serving.  Those extra 30 calories make a big difference to my taste buds, apparently.
80	3	It's okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  My absolute favorite green tea is made by specialteas.com.  It's a decaf apricot green tea.  I always end up going back to that after trying other teas.  I've even gotten used to drinking it plain without any sweeteners.  A cup sounds pretty good right now!
81	1	Awful taste it was soft and airy I fed it to my dogs.
82	5	This is one of the best K cups out there. Nice bold flavor.No bitter after taste. If you want a bold K cup try this!
83	3	I don't get why they are so expensive on Amazon. Either way these are kind of gross. Enjoy!
84	5	I grew up with Open Pit BBQ sauce in IN and could no longer find it in TN. Thanks to the sellers on Amazon, I can continue to enjoy this excellent sauce.  My step sons had never had it before, but it quickly became there favorite. It is the best sauce out there and I would recommend it.
85	5	I was already a big fan of the Popchips Salt and Vinegar flavor, so when I saw that they were coming out with a Chili Lime flavor I was so excited to try it! The flavor does NOT disappoint - tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite  chip ! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!
86	3	I suppose I should have figured this bar would be crunchy considering this is the Nut Delight variety but I didn't expect this much crunch! Crunch factor similar to Gobstopper hard candy (I think it is the syrup that holds the nuts together that makes it so hard). There was also a type of nut that is included in the mix that I did not care for, (not sure which one). If you like exotic nuts and are looking for a snack that is super crunchy than this is for you. Unfortunately, it did not suit me. On the up side, it is a good source of protein and antioxidents.
87	3	I recently bought one of these at a local pet store and my dog went crazy for it. It lasted a few days with chewing about an hour at a time. So when I saw this product on Amazon for $2 cheaper I jumped on it. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was I ordered 2 of the large bones one was fine and the other arrived broken in half. It is not a cheap bone and they should ship it with more packaging to make sure it does not break during shipping. I am a little apprehensive to give the broken one to my dog as she tends to swallow smaller pieces whole and I do not want her to choke on it.
88	5	The product was previously known to me, and the ease of ordering coupled with the discount of signing for monthly deliveries made for awesome pricing.
89	5	The cocoa on the almonds is just right.  This makes a healthy snack or dessert.  I went through a can in two days...
90	5	Good cereal. Don't know what else you want me to say about it. But definately good stuff.
91	3	I give this 3 stars because it wasn't unpleasant coffee.  It just didn't taste like anything.  It reminded me of hot water with those Folgers coffee bags dunked in it for a little bit.  I don't like too strong a coffee but this was way underpowered for coffee.  I enjoy the bolder coffees, too, such as Coffee People Organic Bold and Dark Magic.  I would not buy Nantucket again.
92	4	Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much...
93	1	Way  too expensive for a small package. Shipping weight claims eight pounds you receive a 6oz package.<br />I feel ripped off.
94	1	This pasta is good.  BUT they keep sending me whole wheat and the whole wheat tastes like garbage.<br /><br />They made this mistake about 4 times so far.
95	3	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KLT05C >Doctor Kracker Organic and Artisan-Baked Flatbread, Pumpkin Seed Cheddar, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I have eaten this product at Jason's Deli and loved it.  However, when I found it online, the price was quite high, but since we liked it so much, I ordered it anyway.  It was delivered quickly, just a matter of a couple days, because it is made not 10 miles from our office.  BUT IT TASTED STALE.  That was a real disappointment and I will not order any more.  It's much too expensive to be stale in less than 3 days of my order.  Both my husband and I had it again at Jason's Deli yesterday and it tasted fresh and wonderful.  Our experience was not a happy one.  I tried to find a retailer who sells it in the area, since it is made right here, but could not find one, so I guess we will just have to find something else.
96	5	Walmart was the local carrier for this item, but unfortunately they stopped carrying it....now have to purchase it online....the shipping was very fast, and now enjoying it ..........
97	5	I've always liked lentils but only recently tried green ones.  They are delicious and so good for you.  Makes really elegant soup combined with Italian sausage, garlic, and fennel.  And that's only for starters -
98	5	This is one of my favorites.  It has a depth of flavor that is wonderful.  If you enjoy hazelnut coffee you will enjoy it.  It is distinctly hazelnut, but not over powering.
99	5	Not much to say, a lot of popchips for very little money. Comes out to about half of what a store would charge me.
100	5	This tea has a superb taste.  I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner.  Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea, but this is also a very delicious hot drink too!  I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it.  Fabulous!
101	5	Love this coffee - when it first arrived I thought I had ordered the wrong thing as the  pods  are quite different from regular K-cups, but they work perfectly and I think the coffee tastes much better than the coffee in the plastic pods.  The Fog Chaser is a nice, not-too-strong, coffee, perfect for that first wake up cup in the morning.
102	4	As far as taste goes, they all come running when they hear me opening the package.  I can't vouch for the teeth cleaning properties, as it appeared to me they were mostly swallowing them after a couple of bites.  I keep snacks to a minimum to prevent obesity.  What we need is a flavorful chew for cats they could mouth real well.  I have a couple that would chew them, cleaning their teeth without a lot of calories.
103	5	Of couse, you have to like creaminess.  If you do, give this creamed rice a try.  Yeah, I know it's not cheap; so use it for a special occasion.  However, don't think you're going to eat maybe half a can and save the rest for tomorrow.  You won't stop until that doggone can is empty.<br /><br />It's sweet; but a pleasant, soothing sweet.  Very old-fashioned and came in real handy one day when I was feeling just a bit yucky.  You know, you feel like you need to coat your stomach with something rich, but not upsetting. Like maybe a baby food with grownup flavor?  Yeah, open a can.  Make sure it's in the refrigerator waiting or you.
104	5	Another home run from Garvey's! These pancakes are simply delicious. Very easy to make. I was thrilled to find out they have no trans-fats. They have quickly become a family favorite.
105	5	It is really a value size. Taste is excellent. I have recommended it to my friends. Sending fast and in high quality.
106	4	This is a great-tasting oatmeal but I would l like it to have a little more crunch. I add extra flax seed and some dried fruit. BUT it is worth buying and pretty healthy too.
107	2	I was very diappointed to find there were trans fats in these cookies.<br /><br />Ginger is one of my favorite flavors - however not trans fats.<br /><br />I would not buy them again until the trans fats are removed.
108	3	This tea has a nice taste for making ice tea, but it does not taste like apricot or peach. The lemon myrtle over powers everything else in this tea. It has a good price point, the tea leafs are of fair quality, and the taste is good, if used for iced tea.  It reminds me of lemon zinger tea but with out the hit of chicory at the end.
109	5	This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.
110	5	good stuff we  use it in coffee and in whipping cream for flavor,  have tryed it to flavor too works great...
111	1	I tried brewing this tea on every setting and still it came out tasting like lightly flavored water. The smell was slightly on target but it too was very weak. I would not recommend this tea or the English breakfast. They both are a waste of money. Drink hot water instead.
112	5	These are really good and healthy. Use the  Subscribe & Save  option because you can always have them skip a shipment (or cancel whenever). Watch the price though as it fluctuates greatly. I paid 9.51 for mine (including shipping with  Subscribe & Save ).
113	4	First let me say that I bought this on sale for under $20.  Given that; the per pound price was a good value.  The salmon is what you'd expect from a shelf-stable product.  I'm not a huge fan of the tins so I wouldn't base my buying decision on receiving a Checkered Tin.
114	4	A good wake me up, breakfast blend.  Very smooth and delicious. Would recommend. Will be buying again.  A blend that can be drunk everyday.
115	5	I want to say I am a coconut water addict!!Just tried this one and I am hooked, it is so refreshing and is like drinking from the coconut itself. Brought memories of being in a beach and drinking from the fruit just picked from the palm tree. Drank it cold which is the best way to drink it, the colder the better. Gave it to my toddler and he asked for more, guess he loved it to. I totally recommended. Enjoy your drink!
116	5	My dogs and my pocket book love these treats. Very tasty and healthy snacks at a winning price! I love the variety.
117	5	Just amazing.  Now, I'm spoiled, and don't want anything else.  :)  Just wish it cost less.
118	1	I originally searched for TONE'S or WEBER Canadian steak seasoning.<br />I used these brands for years as a table seasoning in lieu of salt as I<br />am a heart patient and am limited in salt intake.  These filled the bill!<br />When these items could not be found or were discontinued, this product was<br />most similar in their advertising, however the taste of this product<br />is horrible by comparison to the above mentioned superior brands.  I will<br />NOT buy again or recommend!
119	5	These boba pearls are great! They taste amazing and are great to put in tea's, smoothies, coffee's, or just about anything else. I bought them because I moved away from some of my favorite Thai restaurants (who sold Thai tea with boba) and I can brew my own thai tea, pop these in it and it is delicious. The only slight problem is that they take a bit longer to cook than is advertised on the packaging (which says 5-7 minutes). Just leave them boiling a few minutes longer and you'll get the right consistency. All-in-all a great purchase!
120	5	Only positive to say)))Smells amazing, tastes delicious, yammm) This is my 2nd purchase and I really enjoy it. Also, loove their raspberry one.
121	5	I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in  store bacon  anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the  good old days.   Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack.
122	4	I don't generally eat  kid  cereals such as Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, etc but if you like Rice Krispies Treats you might just love this cereal. It's not sticky and chewy like a Rice Krispies treat, but more crispy. Once milk is poured over it softens a bit while still maintaining the shape and flavor of a broken up Rice Krispies treat. It's not too sweet, it seems to have just the right amount of sweetness to make it delicous. My kids also enjoy this cereal. The only drawback is that when I order this they eat it up so quickly. If I had only ordered Raisin Bran I would still have it.
123	5	After MUCH research and two complete urinary tract blockages we discovered that our cat SHOULD NOT be eating grain. Grains such as rice, wheat, corn and gluten are present in a large majority of pet foods available on the market. Manufacturers like to insert grain into pet food to their reduce cost and create inexpensive calories. Grain causes alkaline urine in both cats and dogs. Alkaline urine leads to crystals and bladder stones and develops when an animal eats pet food with grains and fillers (high carb diet). Our pets need only meat, organs and water for proper nutrition and you are not  spoiling  your pet by feeding them an all wet food diet. Kidney failure is one of the most common diseases in cats and I have learned that I'm putting unnecessary strain my cat's kidneys by feeding him crap food. I purchased 8-10 grain free options for my cat to try out because it's very difficult to get an animal to change their diet once established. Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken was a clear winner with my cat Otis and I highly recommend it. If you think you can't afford a grain free diet for your kitty, please consider the $4,000 I have spent unblocking my cat's urinary tract when crystals formed (emergency procedure). Also, be wary of so-called prescription diets that the vets insist will remedy the problem, they are also full of grains and fillers.
124	5	After reading over the reviews for several different coffee brands and flavors, I decided to go with Gloria Jeans Hazelnut and I am so pleased that I did. The price is far less then what I was paying at the stores. The flavor is excellent, the boxing and individual k-cups arrived in perfect condition,(I had read that some did not). I am going to set up for the automatic renewal. What more can I say, it works great for me. Thanks again amazon!!
125	5	My husband was happy to find this and at a great price!!!  He is preparing them for us and friends all the time!!!
126	5	These are the best olives ever - buttery and sweet but not too salty.  They arrived in quickly and in perfect condition.  Fabulous and delicious.
127	5	My baby loves this apple sauce. He didn't like the gerber brand at all, but yummys this down right away and I like that it is organic.
128	3	If you like smooth coffee with a pleasant aftertaste, look elsewhere.  I find Daybreak very acidic...  I've bought about 8 different types of k-cups, this is my least favorite.
129	1	Well, it's green. Sort of an electric tree frog green. And opaque. In fact, it looks a lot like bottled margarita mix. And that's pretty much what it tastes like. If you like the taste of low cal margarita mix, you'll probably enjoy this mocktail mix. If you prefer your margaritas with a little more crisp lime-y bite, give this one a pass. I tried it mixed with water and served over ice. Maybe try mixing it with ice in a blender? I'm too lazy to get the blender out for a quick drink and always drink my Margaritas on the rocks.<br /><br />I have also tried the Target 5-calorie Market Pantry on-the-go drink mix in Lime Margarita. It's more transparent (which seems less disturbing somehow) and comes with recipe enhancers right on the box. For example, add fresh lime juice. There's even a recipe for a full fledged Margarita.<br /><br />In comparison, I found the Crystal Light lacking: too artificial tasting with a less than appealing color.<br /><br />PS. For my second batch, I added 1/2 cup of fresh lime juice. I thought that helped, but the only way my husband would drink it was if he dumped in a bunch of grenadine. Also, when the pitcher was empty I noticed that the product left behind a noticeable chalky white substance on the bottom of the pitcher. We won't be finishing off the rest of the mix.
130	3	This rack of lamb cooked up beautifully and tasted terrific (with a whole lot of herbal rub plastered all over it) but it was just WAYYYYY too fatty.  The amount of grease coming off of it astounded me. I did let it rest on a rack after cooking it so I could eliminate a lot of the grease but there was a whole lot more on the meat itself.  I chaulked it up to a really nasty, fatty, horrendous meal that I allow myself to eat once a year because it really does taste great but is just so unhealthly to ingest. Usually I reserve this once a year deadly treat for eating fried clams .... but......not this year.  I will not ever be buying nor recommending this lamb product!
131	5	Surprisingly tasty. Thin and crip. Very Cracker like and good for snacking. I got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. These are great for when we travel.  It isn't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good, but these work quite well.
132	1	I was not happy with this product, for several reasons. First, it did not have a  Best by date.  Secondly, I could not find the maximun acidity percentage on the bottle. Finally, the product did not have any superb taste, but was rather bland. It was also watery when I poured it for dipping. I am sorry but I will not buy this product again.
133	2	I have not used any of this item.  It is not what I intended to order.<br />I wanted White Tea Asian Plum & that is what I thought I was ordering.<br />Somehow the item I wanted did not get processed.  I have never drank<br />plain white tea, so I don't know if I like it or not.
134	5	This is an exceptional mustard. Is exactly what we experienced in Malta. Was provided very quickly with great customer service. Will order again!<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057YL0VM >Colman's Mustard Paste 170g</a>
135	5	I love to make  Reese's  smoothies with:<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002H062DA >Blue Diamond Almond Breeze Milk, Unsweetened Vanilla, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0Y2 >Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder, Mayan Superfood, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GYJUHO >Torani Syrup, Sugar Free, French Vanilla, 33.8 Ounce (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UPOK58 >100% Whey Protein-EAS 5 LB.

This powdered peanut butter  tastes delicious too!<br /><br />If you are just looking for a way to change up your protein smoothies, this would work well too with just almond milk, EAS vanilla protein powder, sugar free french vanilla syrup, and a couple tablespoons of this.  My kids LOVE this recipe!
136	5	I'm not someone who needs incredibly strong coffee, but after we received a Keurig as a wedding gift, basically every pack of K-cups we bought seemed really weak.  After a bit of reading, this seems to be a somewhat common complaint.  The Jet Fuel packs are the first ones we actually think taste like coffee.  I'll definitely be buying more.
137	5	I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years.  There is no subsitute.  Many women in my family use it as well.  This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation.  I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle, natural laxitive.  I've never felt like I've taking a harsh stimulant, it just makes you feel & go like normal :)  I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing!  LOL
138	5	Amazon keeps wanting me to rave about Pelindaba products separately so I shall.  These are among the best cookies I have enjoyed. If you like lavender welcome these to your table. I urge those who hesitate to give these a try.  And no I do not work for Pelindaba but am relentlessly enthusistic about their products.
139	2	The Swiss chocolate was very good and my kids loved them however I didn't realize until after my wife purchased this item just how expensive it was per kcup! If you are looking for an occasional cup of hot choc for yourself this is fine but not for carnivourous kids.
140	3	Ener-g macaroni is cheaper than other GF pastas; unfortunately it also suffers from texture problems that Tinkyada & Glutino have managed to solve.  I found that the macaroni tubes started to split into little noodle fragments even before they had gotten to the  al dente  stage.<br />A decent GF pasta solution, although the wheat-eaters in your life may not care for it as much as other brands.
141	4	I have noticed that the clear product line has really been making a name for themselves. I have been seeing them in alot of stores that I frequent. The first product I tried was the shea oil which I loved very much so I was excited to try this Scalp Nourishing Balm. The first thing I noticed was that the balm its self was very thick, like a thick yellow grease but it smelled great. Im not really a fan of grease so I mainly used this on my edges and to moisturize and seal my ends. It also works pretty good on wet or dry hair.But be careful of using to much because I can tell that it can cause alot of build up. Once again,a little goes a long way.
142	4	I'm fairly new to the gluten-free world as I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease only a few months ago. I have tried several gluten-free sandwich breads, and Udi's is the best I've tried. It looks, smells, and feels like an upscale version of regular sandwich bread. The flavor is great, and the bread is soft and yummy right out of the bag. Toasting it makes the flavor even better, and the bread also makes great french toast. If you are in the market for a gluten-free bread that is delicious right out of the bag, this one is for you. It is about $3.99 a loaf at the local Lowes Foods store (in the frozen food section), and it stays fresh for a couple of weeks once it's thawed.
143	5	Happy to be able to get my favourite tea at a good price as I not a big fan of American tea bags, though I admit I haven't tried too many. Now I can enjoy my morning cuppa!
144	5	This is one of my favorite Korean junk food/quasi meals.  If you're not used to this product, it might be weird to you, but I find it delicious.  You make it like a typical package of ramen at the beginning but you leave out the  sauce  packaging.. which kind of looks like finely ground coffee beans.  Then when the noodles are cooked, you drain almost all the water, add the mini oil package and sauce, stir until you have a thick sauce and enjoy.  yum.  I am jazzed that Amazon offers this online, otherwise I'd have to drive so far away to Korea town to get it which is a huge hassle.  Yay for Amazon, yay for Chaps!!  I heart online shopping.
145	5	I was hesistant about such a mixture but I want what's best for my baby so I bought it.  It doesn't look the most appetizing but my baby LOVED it!  This will be a constant food for him until he moves on to the next stage - love, love, love this brand!
146	4	I don't know that water really needs  enhancing  but sometimes a little blast of flavor is nice.  With no carbs, calories or fat, this product breaks the just plain water monotony.<br /><br />Packaged in a nifty little bottle, it is easy to use.  Just flip the cap, tip into your beveage and squeeze, one or two squeezes does the trick. Click the top back on to secure.  Despite the lack of natural ingredients, the flavor was pleasantly peachy.  It was not too sweet and I did not notice any heavy chemical aftertaste.  I have tried it in water, plain seltzer water for a nifty peach soda, iced tea and hot tea.  The flavor provided a nice change.  The bottle is small enough to pop into a backpack or purse and when closed properly does not leak.  I wish this item was all natural but even so, I will keep a bottle on hand just for a change of pace.
147	1	I respect Mrs. May's products, they're usually good, which is why I'm so surprised how BAD these things taste.<br />The texture resemble styrofoam and the taste is very chemically, with an apple after taste. I bought because of<br />low calorie content = 38/bag. But it was lower than that cuz I threw it away. Absolutely inedible.
148	5	This tea is one of my all time favorites. It has such a clean, refreshing taste and intoxicating scent. From the moment I open the waxed paper liner, and all throughout it's brewing cycle (I make mine in a coffee maker) it just smells so delicious.<br /><br />I like to put this peppermint tea over ice and add a touch of Stevia Spoonable Powder NO Calories NO Carbohydrates Extracted from the leaves of the Stevia plant with high concentrations of Steviosides and Rebaudiosides - 16 Oz #ST52 for sweetness.<br /><br />My husband prefers this tea served hot in the winter, I love it year round.
149	5	The best oatmeal I have ever eaten.  Wish the local stores would start carrying it again, but, thanks to Amazon, I can still get it.
150	5	I first purchased this at Big Lots, skeptical that it would be any good but it was cheap so I thought why not. I used the easy recipe printed on the container (lemon juice, seasoning and butter) and cooked the chicken on our rotisserie. It was AWESOME! I quickly used up the rub and was saddened that I couldn't buy more of it anywhwere. So happy that I can get it on-line. You've got to try it - you will not be disappointed!
151	5	I don't drink coffee but have many visitors who do.  I got the Kuerrig coffee maker as a gift last year and needed to replenish the K-cups.  Consumer Reports rated this brand #1 so I got them.  Rave reviews from those who have used them.
152	5	This item shipped quickly and appears to be doing the job I bought it for.
153	2	Try the packets instead ... can't seem to gauge what is the best amount to use. Look at agave nectar also, a natural product that is really delicious.
154	3	I love the generous quantity and the taste and flavor, but the coffee is just too weak.  I will not buy this one again but maybe go to the Maxwell House House Blend.
155	4	Well, when you buy a noodle made with yam flour, tofu, or something unconventional you cannot expect it to feel or taste like regular noodles.<br /><br />That being said, I knew what I was buying and I got what I expected. A chewy/gummy noodle, that can be used as a pasta substitute.<br /><br />It's filling, the noodles smell unpleasant when you first open the bag...but that goes away once rinsed and heated.<br /><br />I actually like these noodles. Quite tasty and versatile if prepared correctly (i.e. in soups, stir fried with garlic and veggies, etc).
156	5	I was really glad to be able to find this product on Amazon.  I purchased it at the Whole Food and they stopped stocking it.  It's very good with a natural sweetness.
157	5	You pay for the best; and this is the best. Fresh. Bright Red. Do not be fooled by the rest. Well buy this again.
158	5	I purchased a small buster cube for one of my cats, who is an expert at quickly deciphering puzzle treat dispensers. The ones that merely require tipping or rolling a ball are too easy, and the Nina Ottoson puzzles are conquered in less than ten minutes. However, more than six months later, this cat probably spends an hour each day occupied by the Buster Cube, deftly rolling it over the rounded corners to shake out his breakfast.<br /><br />No other puzzle toy I've met can keep clever animals occupied for as long as the Buster Cube. My cat is definitely less anxious and restless since getting it. I just wish that they made a version that was easier to clean, and perhaps even chew-proof (I wouldn't leave the hard plastic unattended with a hard-chewing rottweiler, for example). Now that we're getting a new puppy, the Buster Cube is the first toy on my list.
159	5	This is a great choice if your schedule/budget/dog's appetite doesn't allow for raw food or a freeze-dried solution. If you're on this page, chances are you've read about feeding your dog a natural, grain-free diet to combat issues with your dog's health, most commonly skin-related. Many dogs have a grain  allergy,  causing itchiness and rash, which is often wiped out by switching to a grain-free diet.<br /><br />My dog doesn't do the raw thing, being an old man and set in his ways, and so he prefers kibble. I've personally never fed him anything but grain-free food, and hardly ever notice him scratching or biting at his skin. He absolutely loves this food, and being old and lazy having a low-fat alternative is great for his activity level. There are many grain-free choices out there, so I would personally highly recommend trying different kinds to see what your dog likes - I have to admit that I haven't seen many low-fat grain-free kibble products, so this is the one I went with. Couldn't be happier, especially with Prime shipping!
160	1	This is the worst coffee I have ever bought. It is extremely bitter. It has no good coffee flavor characteristics.<br />Wish I could return, so I am throwing away $50. Rating it one star is far too generous.
161	2	because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread. Some parts of your steak are saltier than others. It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special, to my buds anyway. I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be 'applied' evenly. Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered.
162	5	What's in this stuff? I'm not a hot sauce fanatic, and I don't even like overly spicy food, but this stuff is positively addictive. There is a sweet component to it, and a garlicky component that makes this more than just plain tabasco or hot sauce.<br /><br />I particularly like it on sliced avocado, scrambled egg or fried egg, and on stir fries, especially plainer ones with tofu and veg. It's also absolutely delectable on shrimp as a cocktail sauce mixed with ketchup, or on fish in general.  When we go out for Vietnamese pho (a broth with rice noodles, bean sprouts and various meats and garnishes) we squirt in a good lashing of this sauce to liven up the broth.<br /><br />I even saw a  pyramid  of food groups cartoon, with sriracha sauce squirted all over the pyramid, and I can only agree with the sentiment. There's practically no food, save chocolate ice cream, that isn't improved by a dash of this.
163	4	I'm on long-term antibiotics and found that regular coffee triggered reflux and other GI problems - so I've switched to decaf - found the Gevalia decaf T-discs at Bed, Bath and Beyond but they are rather pricey and I don't like to go shopping - so using Subscribe and Save, these are a lot cheaper and are delivered to my door -<br /><br />I make a cup of this every morning and have half with my oatmeal and then mid-morning, have a snack and finish my cup - just right!
164	5	Using Lavazza Crema Gusto in my Moka is like being back in Italy. It makes a great cup of cappucino, without which I cannot start my day.  Rich flavor, strongly roasted but not burnt tasting.  The vacuum package keeps it very fresh.
165	5	My little dog enjoys this toy quite a lot.  He hasn't quite figured out how the treats come out yet, but he's always happy when they do!  LOL!
166	5	I got a hankering again for these treats and had trouble finding them anywhere except online.  These are the original article, with a bite that will get your attention immediately.  Love 'em.
167	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5PVI >Taylors of Harrogate Imperial Gunpowder Leaf Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.41-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>In general we prefer a black tea to green tea. Taylors of Harrogate Imperial Gunpowder Leaf Tea is a notable exception. It is amongst the group of our preferred teas. It has a delicate subtle flavor. We prefer to drink it in the late afternoon or with dessert after dinner. Earlier in the day we prefer black tea. If you find green teas to be bland then you may wish to try this tea ... it is a very distinctive tea.
168	5	We get these on a regular basis.  Great for a quick breakfast or mid afternoon snack.  Taste great.  Love the regular nut delight bars.
169	5	I was happy with the taste of this coffee, and the speed of the shipping.
170	3	I really like the flavor of these but they are a bit tougher than I am used to.  I dont think I will be buying them again.
171	5	My standby is Timothy's German Chocolate Cake....it is to die for...I just tried this and it was DELICIOUS.  It smells great, tastes just like a warm chocolate glazed donut.  You MUST try this coffee!
172	5	This is a delightful, refreshing drink that is not loaded with sugar and artificial flavors.  Very delicious and thirst-quenching.  Highly recommended.
173	4	We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh.
174	5	Kashi Brand oatmeal is truly different from many others I've tried.  The Go Lean Instant is not an oatmeal with the usual hot oatmeal texture.  It's not thick and pasty as many other brands are.  It's got a nutty consistency and a thinner base - it doesn't feel like food that's been chewed for you.  It wins in both texture & taste categories!
175	5	My parents are pack rats and they don't throw away many things ... because of this they have expired dried food ... so every time I go home their house is like a moth farm. Moths were flying in my face, near my food ... they were just everywhere.<br /><br />I bought a couple of these traps and put them up near their food source (flour, grains, crackers, cereal, etc.) and hoped that they would help. A month later my parents called and told me how great the traps were ... they were very thankful. I didn't know how effective these traps were until I visisted my parents' home again .. I did not see one moth! Very impressed .. and I would recommend this product to anyone.
176	5	This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say,  Go find .  They love it, and will throw the  stump  around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that  Go find  spreads around.  You may want to confine the play to a room that is easily mopped.
177	1	I bought a package of these at Starbucks, and thought good crispy, hmmmm so I bought a case of a mix cinnamon, sugar, chocolate chip and oatmeal.  First they all tasted the same.  They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.
178	5	Love eating these for lunch when I need something with a little more flavor than just a sandwich. Portion size isn't huge... that's good or bad depending on your perspective! :-)
179	5	Since I had used this product previously, I knew what I was getting.  The product arrived in a timely manner, was packaged well and was fresh.  I would order again when needed since I can no longer find this product locally and I don't care for the other brands offered.
180	5	I was a little skeptical of buying this at first because I have tasted pure caffeine powder before and its unbearably bitter. The blend the Blast Powder has made was untasteable in everything I tried it with except water..it made it a little sweet. All in all I would highly recommend this product because of the result. I love coffee, energy drinks..etc and I have never received the kind of energy high that I did when I have a take a packet of Blast Powder. Best way I can describe it is that it is unlike anything else I have ever tried. I never got shaky or jittery (like I do sometimes from coffee) or heart palpitations like I sometimes get from Monster drinks. It felt like my brain and mind was focused on a level I have never felt before and the best part is it lasted almost 8 hours! Gotta get some if you havent already :}
181	5	We love our Keurig machine but found the kcups to be expensive.  This brand of coffee offers a strong, bold cup of coffee and at a lower price point that most of the others.<br /><br />We have the box of 80 delivered every month, very convenient.
182	5	I have purchased these a couple times for my two dogs.  Great price (even with the expensive shipping charge) and long lasting.  There is nothing worse than paying $8 for a dog chew and then watching your dog eat it in less than 5 minutes!
183	5	This is a very good, honest, straightforward tea. It doesn't pretend to be anything more by adopting fancy names or claims to miraculous powers. It's quite strong, so I just use less: one fewer bag in a pot of tea is still strong enough not to be overpowered by milk.
184	5	I think that the Kind Bars are really tasty, especially the Almond & Coconut.  They are quite filling although addictive.
185	4	These are great!  Very tasty and filling.  Believe me when I say I am not a health nut and have only just started trying to add these kinds of healthy things into my diet and I am not kidding when I say these are great tasting.  I didn't give 5 stars as I didn't like the taste of some of the blueberries, they have a funny aftertaste.  The good thing is there isn't that many floating around in there so they are easy to avoid.  I eat a handful plane as my brunch snack, but can easily see that they would taste great in oatmeal, yogurt or as a cereal.  I can't wait to try the other flavors and other KIND products.
186	5	Not all Chinese restaurants have great hot'n sour soup and not all packaged soups are good but this product rivals the best authentic Chinese hot 'n sour soup from restaurants. The flavor is great, there are lotsa noodles and other goodies. I sometimes add additional chopped shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots. Also great to add is cooked pork (julienned). If you enjoy hot 'n sour soup, do yourself a favor and buy this item.
187	5	Buy this product.  Tell your friends about it.  Unfortunately J&J doesn't have a clue of how to market this great product, don't let it slip out of production. I am in club Benecol and haven't received anything. Spread the word, a safer way to lower your cholesterol. Word of mouth is about it, lets hope it works.<br /><br />Don't expect miracles with Benecol, but if you are borderline, this is a great supplement in addition to diet and exercise. Take at least 2 per day.  Expect ~10% lower total cholesterol in a month or two, some have reported more. Could be enough to keep you off the risky statins.  However, some report using Benecol and Statins, but I can't vouch for the results. It would be good to hear reports of that combo.
188	5	just like the commonly available crispy sesame snacks but the addition of black cumin is exotic and tasty.  I like it.  The price is right, too.
189	5	I was pleased with the quality of the product. The speed in which I received the package was great.
190	1	I purchased these treats from a different store (BJ'S) and they made BOTH my dogs sick! One of them being a 8 week old puppy! DO NOT BUY THESE! DO NOT FEED THEM TO YOUR DOGS! They are dangerous! I will never purchase another Milk Bone product EVER AGAIN!
191	5	This is the closest thing I've found to regular bread. I find it simple to mix up and bake as well, which is even better! I warm the oven and pop it in there to rise, especially when it's cold out. It rises really nicely and then cooks up great. I have to cover mine partway through with foil to keep it from getting too dark on top. I have had trouble with it sticking to the pan when I go to get it out. My mother-in-law uses a double-walled pan (like the air bake cookie sheets, only in bread pan form I guess) and doesn't have any trouble with sticking, so I guess I'm going to have to try that! This gluten free bread mix is worth the time and money.
192	5	Hazelnut was always my favorite before k-cups were invented, and I have to say this Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is no exception!  My favorite of all the flavored coffees I have tried, I particularly like Gloria Jean's flavors the best, particularly the Butter Toffee, and the Capuccino is also very good.
193	5	I got these because I have an elderly cat with both Diabetes and Inflammatory Bowel Disease and I was glad to find a ' novel protein' low-carb treat for him.  He was glad too -- he loves them.  My other 2 also went crazy about them including the 4 month old kitten who who growl with horrible relish as he devoured the treats.  ( I did have to cut or break them into smaller pieces for the kitten but that was no big deal. )
194	5	This 50 pack is an excellent value, great to take with you traveling or to use at home! Instand has the same great flavor of all Stackbuck's coffees.
195	3	Definitely came with 72 packets, but I kind of expected the box to be bigger. 72 packets fits into a pretty small box! $16 is a lot for gummy bears, but I guess I got what I ordered so I'm satisfied enough. If you want 'em bad enough, it's certainly as advertised! just be aware of what you're getting for your money.
196	5	Thanks so much for the peppermint mocha flavor. It's not so easy to come by these days and for me, it's a staple when the weather is chilly. Looking forward to Fall so I can enjoy it!
197	4	I'm new to the espresso world and found the Lavazza via forums doing research about espresso. Obviously others can tell you this is not as good as freshly grinding it yourself, but this espresso is excellent in my opinion. Ditch your local coffee shops and make it at home!
198	5	Although it is a little pricey compared to most cat foods, my cats are worth it!  :)  Their coats have been softer and they eliminate less waste while eating this cat food.  Additionally, this is such high quality stuff (look at the ingredients!) that you don't have to feed them as much as standard  commercial  cat food found at a typical grocery store.  I'd say I only have to feed them 50-75% as much.  I have two cats and a 6 pound bag lasts me a little over two weeks.  And on the occasion that I did not purchase this brand (due to convenience typically), my cats are always crying and hungry because their little bodies are not fulfilled!  This is the best cat food!
199	5	All I want to say is that the coffee Especially (Siena) is really my favorite of all the gormet stuff out there. It's reasonably priced but the shipping charges make it way too expensive. I just won't shell out close to $20.00 for a 12oz bag of coffee. I need to find another way to purchase this wonderful coffee. Anyone out there know how? let me know. Thank you.
200	5	I've these before in replacement of my traditional granola bar. I received in my summer voxbox from Influenster last week, but this time I warmed it up before devouring it. OH MY!!! It was incredible. I definitely recommend warming them up. This will be a great warm breakfast for fall. Banana nut bread goodness.
201	2	I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste  off  like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(
202	4	Great tasting vanilla taste. I have tried many different brands and this one seems to be the best of the bunch.  I always purchase these K-cups as gifts for my mother-in-law for gifts and she looks forward to every holiday. Great product.
203	4	Natural Value is an excellent cat food and I appreciate the special price with .99 shipping you had in August; But now that Nutricity is selling it for $21.43/case plus $19 for shipping, it is far too costly and I will not be purchasing it at this site.
204	5	rich strong bold tasting coffee in the morning is what you like than this one is for you. if not than don't buy it.
205	5	Bakery On Main Cranberry GF Maple Nut Bars are a welcome addition to my GF pantry. They are easy to take along while running errands or road trips. There is always one or more in my purse. They are a tasty snack.
206	5	My dogs really like these. My six year old adopted Spoodle came to us with bad teeth and a weight problem. She had 14 teeth pulled and is halfway to her weight goal, and has learned to like crunchy snacks.<br /><br />My ten year old lab likes anything, but also needs to watch his teeth and his weight.<br /><br />I like to give them a treat before I leave the house, so that they are happy instead of anxious when they see me get my coat and keys.<br /><br />These treats are perfect at only 18 calores each, and the dogs are excited to eat them. The lab makes short work of it, but the Spoodle gets to give her remaining teeth a workout. ChristineJW
207	5	I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.
208	5	Dogs in my neighborhood all enjoy it. This is all around good product for puppy and older adult dogs. I have given it to puppies for now to pull away from chewing shoes. We have some medium puppies 30 lbs and adult 30 lbs dogs. Bull Mastiffs. And they like to chew it. That's good idea.
209	1	I've been cutting back on my salt intake and thought this product would be good, however, it contains soooo much black pepper (it's the first ingredient listed on the label).  I can not use much  to season my food because the black pepper is overwhelming and then the food is too spicy and bothers my stomach. I can not recommend this product.
210	4	The cats should love these little jars of different wet flavors, and even you cats who are accustomed to dry food should like this.  You feel like you're giving them something healthful and gourmet when you serve them this.  The food is quite liquidly, which could be a good or bad thing depending on their and your preference.  Open a jar and serve it to them, and don't mistake it for tuna for yourself!
211	5	Do I like coffee with my cream?  HELL YEA!  That's why this tasty little nuke in my mouf is getting 5 stars for deliciousness.
212	4	Packaging is very inviting, but there is not one word of instructions on the box or on the individually wrapped pouches.  When I opened the foil packet,the coffee fragrance was tantalizing. One side of the little pouch of coffee did say,  This side down.  Not realizing they were for a pod brewer, I put them in my single cup drip maker with the appropriate side down--this yielded tasteless brown water like bad motel coffee that I threw away. Finally I saw one line on the Amazon product page that indicated these were for a pod brewer. Unfortunately, I do not have one, so I cut a little coffee bag open and dumped it into my single serve French press. This brewed a good, very strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is a decent product, but cries out for directions!!
213	5	I have tried most of the other dark bold coffees and this is my favorite. It is the first K-cup that my girlfriend really likes. They very quickly disappeared soon after she discovered them.
214	5	My favorite coffee it is bold but not over powering. i like this coffee and it is a joy to drink,one of the best k cup bolds out there. amazon good price and coffee people good product
215	3	After the first go-round, my little mutt knew exactly how to get at the hidden treats.  Treats are always welcome, but I think she gets more fun being put in a  sit  and watching me move around pretending to hide a bon-bon in various places. She's learned that it won't usually be in the last place I stop - but in which other one? Dogs are as different as the rest of us, but seems to me that only a rather slow dog or a lovable-but-dumb one would find this toy mentally challenging after the first time or two.  I give it three stars for their sakes.
216	5	This is a great nutritious cereal. Great flavor.  I have been eating this cereal for many years on a regular basis.  No other brands even compare.
217	5	Very filling breakfast food. This granola should be more widely distributed in grocery stores in the US because right now it is a bit hard to find at my local grocery store.
218	5	Maybe it's a psychological thang but it seems to have a nice salty mineral flavor without being tooo aggressive.  I like to use it in a grinder and use to finish off my steaks and roasts.  Will buy more soon
219	4	I usually buy avoderm but this food is an excellent way for me to stretch out the case. I feed the kids this and they eat it all.... No leftovers!
220	5	This is the best pizza sauce anywhere!!!  Don Pepino's flavor is unique and popular.  Our family has been using Don Pepino sauce for more than 20 years.  It really makes our pizza and pepperoni buns.  We are happy that Amazon offers it because it is hard to order elsewhere.  Also, Amazon has easy, safe ordering.
221	5	My daughter is 5 months old and has been struggling since the day she was born with constipation, gas, and reflux.  We've tried formula after formula after formula, nothing but vomit and severe constipation.  Finally we found a formula that helped with her constipation but she was still having problems with her reflux, even with added rice.  The drs however continued to say she was at a steady growing rate so there was nothing to worry about.  Well, one day I ran out of formula and ran to the store to pick up some more.  FORTUNATELY, the store was out of the Similac Alimentum.  Nearing her feeding time, I was in a rush, so I glanced over the other formulas to find one that would be the closest match.  I just happened to pick up Similac Sensitive R.S. Now not only is she not spitting up, she's staying full longer, sleeping through the whole night, and SHE'S NOT GASSY OR CONSTIPATED!!!  HURRAY!  Another minor pro is that it doesn't reek like the Alimentum does.  Kind of smells like Vanilla Flavored Ensure.  I called all my friends just days after buying the product and recommended it to everyone.  I couldn't be anymore grateful.
222	5	A really good cup of coffee.  I bought this for my husband, who is fussy about his coffee.  The  pod  cups fit great in the Keurig.  The price was good as well.
223	4	They work great!<br />This is instant coffee but it's good, not great but good.<br />Better than most not as good as some.<br />small individual packages, easy to take with you.<br />mild flavor not to strong.<br />About average cost.
224	5	I love this stuff. It has really helped me with a lot of things. I absolutely swear by it. I probably drink this tea at least once a week. Sometimes several times a day if I feel the need.
225	3	I love Jelly bellys.  So when I saw an offer for buy 3 bags of flops and get one free, I was excited.  Unfortunately between the 4 bags, eight pounds, there were only about 8 flavors.  Next time I will just buy premium jelly beans.
226	2	Out of all of the  ready-to-eat  offerings from kitchens of India this is the least tasteful I've had so far.  I absolutely strongly recommend you combine this with some other starchy food like rice, naan, potatoes, or anything.  Eating it combined with something else makes it at least tolerable while eating it alone simply isn't.  The texture can be a bit gritty, it's similiar to eating food with an excessive amount of turmeric - even though it's not an ingredient in this product.  I say  can be gritty  because the quality of the product seems to be a bit inconsistent.  A few will be better than others, a few will make you want to throw all of it out.  Definitely won't be purchasing this one again!
227	5	Our son, since he was born, has had really tough problems with GERD, spit up, etc.  It's made the little guy pretty miserable.  His doctor suggested that we switch to a formula especially designed to address spit up issues.  Although he says--and I'm sure he's right--that Similac and Enfamil are basically identical, and interchangeable, at least in our household they're not.  My son will not drink Enfamil at all, but is perfectly happy with the Similac.  We had no trouble switching from Similac Advance to this formulation; he sucked it right down, unlike the Enfamil, which, even when he was really hungry, he refused to eat.<br /><br />And, not only does he eat it, it works!  We were really surprised at how much of a difference it made, and how quickly.  He did have some difficulty at first, because he'd gotten used to eating so much MORE formula--he spit up so much before, that a lot of his eating was playing  catch up.   So we had a few  I ate too much  episodes, but then he started feeling much better and settled into a more predictable eating pattern.  He still does spit up, but it's nowhere near as bad as it was.  He used to have these fountains of vomit, and now it's just the occasional (small) vomit bubble.
228	3	There is decent value in the product and the packaging is first rate. However, the jerky is almost rock hard making it difficult to chew.
229	5	I bought one of these at whole foods one day while running errands.  Daughter seemed hungry and I knew I wouldn't be home for a bit so I gave these a try.  My baby was 9 months at the time and she easily held and fed herself.  From then on my daughter and I were hooked! I was loving the convenience and easy portability that young babies can eat these straight from the pouch.  I love that its organic and the packaging is free of everything harmful.  I now buy multiple flavors in bulk from amazon! So happy to have tried this food. A++
230	5	i just wanna say that buffalo bills jerky is the best jerky i have ever eaten in my life and i have eaten alot of jerky moist tender great taste i will be ordering more asap
231	5	There were some issues with the initial order, but it has been resolved.  This product is important to my health and am glad to finally receive it.  This tea is good for my blood pressure and energy.
232	5	We buy these for travel (the TSA is OK with them for some reason) and for the kids lunches. I have also been known to crack one open and dump it over ice with the morning's cold coffee and it satisfies that iced mocha craving! We also love the Hazlenut in this brand/size.
233	5	I love to bake and I have to say that this the best bread flour I have ever used. I love that it is unbleached, and it gives a smooth texture to whatever your baking.I made homemade pizza last weekend using this flour and it made the best crust ever, chewy inside, crispy outside and no bleachy aftertaste.
234	4	Taste great, once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk. Anything from this supplier is good quality and value.
235	5	My dog loves all Merrick foods!  I wish amazon sold them themselves, because shipping is so steep elsewhere.  My dog was pretty finicky, but we haven't found any Merrick food he doesn't like.  The canned ones are great, too!
236	5	I love this chocolate. I found it once and cannot find it anymore but $10 for 1 bar is a little excessive!
237	3	I've been drinking green smoothies for a while now, and decided I would try to improve them by adding even more nutrients with Amazing Grass. I opted for the berry flavor because most of my smoothies were made with berries anyway, so I thought it would go well. I also decided to go with Berry because it costed a few dollars less than the original. Next time, I will pay the extra few dollars. The taste reminded me of cherry cough syrup or something medicinal. It unfortunately ruined the taste of my green smoothie. Now I have this entire container to go through, I will probably just mix with water and gag it down. It's too bad, I was excited to use this product.
238	1	I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc.
239	5	This jam is true to its name.  It has a  wild  taste to it that makes it one of the tastiest jams I have enjoyed.  I usually favor blackberries but this jam makes me rethink my initial preference.
240	5	I read the review posted above mine and kept thinking,  Are they talking about the same product?   I love this stuff.  I need a boost at various times during the week and this works well.  It's all natural and no calorie sweetened with the safest natural sweetener on the market.  It's taste is good and it does the job, at least for me.
241	3	LOVE Banana Taffy but found them to stick to the wrapper so I wasn't getting much to eat. I provbabley would not buy these taffy's again!
242	5	I really like this tea.  Its really nice iced and hot, and has a sweet aroma as you open the packages.  My grandmother went to morrocco and really liked the tea there, and even she thought that this was good stuff.  The only thing I have to say that's negative would be the box design makes it difficult to grab the packets from the little like half circle opening, just open up the back otherwise they get all messed up and you have to push your fingers and root around trying to grab one of them and then pull them out etc.  Really good tea for a really nice price.  Even though I just bought 6 boxes, I would buy this again for sure (me and my family have already gone through three, and I gave one away as a gift).
243	5	From childhood on, I have considered Wheatena to be the best tasting hot cereal I have eaten.  It has been difficult to find in local stores in recent years and I have now placed two orders with Amazon.com to fill my pantry.  The service was quick and the price reasonable for this hard to obtain item.
244	5	Was told by a friend to try Nettle tea for allergies. Brought it & it works great & quickly. Long time allergy suffer who loves Nettle tea. I'm able to use it & stopped all the other medications....
245	5	Almond & Cashew sound GREAT!?- Too pricey for me (almost double...!)!<br /><br />I'll try them when their price gets more in-line..., with the other Kind bars!
246	5	LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!
247	5	I bought these for my 7 year old son.  He wasn't too crazy about them, but when his friends come over for play dates, they snarf them down like crazy!  I bought a case, so I have plenty.  Point of the story, while MY son doesn't like them, they are very popular with his buddies!
248	5	It all started when I was working late at night, no food left, and no place open to get food in the building. I stumbled across a snack machine wanting cookies, but the only cookies they had were golden oreos. I opted to try them since I loved regular oreos, and they were the most delicious cookies I've ever eaten.<br /><br />Now i get the full size packs for at home snacking, and they're delicious. They taste similar to regular oreos, but are vanilla flavor. The creme in the center is still the same, so no flavor change there.<br /><br />The new packaging is also great, no more opening one side and having all the cookies go stale. You can lift up the tab on the top of the packaging, and you can see all the cookies in plain view. When you're done, just reseal it, and it magically closes perfectly and air tight each time.<br /><br />I haven't tried eating them with milk, or dunking them in milk yet, but I'm sure they're just as delicious as the regular Oreos. Another nice bonus is the fact that they don't turn your teeth and tongue black like regular oreos do. I always opted out of eating regular oreos in public because I didn't want people to think I had bad teeth, but these leave no marks or stains all over your mouth.<br /><br />Buy them on amazon, they're delicious cheap, and you cant just have one!
249	5	These M&Ms were perfect addition to the candy buffet at our fall wedding. They were gone in no time flat!
250	5	I've been buying this stuff since 1967 when you could buy a box of six packets for $.79.  I grew up on the stuff....every morning M-F for 40 years....well I miss some every now and then when travelling.  I am glad to see Amazon stocks it because it is sometimes hard to find the bulk cans in the local stores.
251	4	Price, taste, nutrition, and fiber-benefit flat out beats anything Metamusil could market, and it's organic. You can't be the value of this product. Need I say more?
252	4	This is a good cup of coffee, far better than that made of the over-roasted beans of Starbucks many varieties. The taste is rich and more importantly, there is no aftertaste to give your stomach grief. I recommend this product for coffee-lovers who've felt that they needed to give up java for a fusty cup of tea.
253	5	I purchased this coffee flavor (Hazelnut) for my wife and she is really enjoying it.  Only problem is when we received the box, all k-cups were packed inside the box and a couple of k-cup were punctured.  This is caused by the edges from the other k-cups.  We ended up with coffee grounds all inside the box. Very inconvenience.
254	5	I must admit I love my Jasmine Tea (<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RTNBSA >Ito En Jasmine Japanese Green Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> but I can't down more than a bottle of it a day, it gets a bit cloying if I do.<br />So I switch over to this old standby and I can drink a gallon of it a day.  One tea bag will honestly make an entire gallon if you have a jar that big and let it steep for a few minutes.<br /><br />I live in a very hot humid subtropical environment and we all love our iced tea here.  I don't use sugar but I mix in so much lemon juice it's almost half lemonaid.  And it must be ice cold.  This can be watered down or made very strong depending on your taste.  I like mine on the watery side.  This can be a bit acidic if you make it strong.  It is a very strong tea with a strong flavor so making it weak works well with this.<br /><br />I probably have a dozen types of teas on my shelf but along with my daily bottle of jasmine tea I drink this the most.<br />It has a distinctive flavor I never get tired of.  It's almost like a comfort food to me, as I grew up drinking<br />Lipton Tea.  It's  been around forever.  Constant Comment <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRHG >Bigelow Constant Comment Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>is another old standby tea worth trying.
255	2	I bought the packs after a trip to NYC -- and due to the long wait -- could not get into the restaurant.  It was pretty bad.  The chocolate had a weird after-taste.  I would have been better off making a chocolate milk shake.  In order to use up all of the packs, I am going to try to add coffee to the milk to try to mask that funny taste.
256	1	what I get is not England kit kat but kit kat made in germany and  and there is a huge deferent in taste so there is kind of cheat in this item
257	5	This is great coffee. I love the taste. I am really enjoying the new Vue coffee pot the flavors taste much better than with the regular keurig pots. would definitley buy again.
258	5	This product is exactly what it says on the box...awsome coffee, gets me up and moving. Have recommended it to many friends who all agree. If you want a jump start on your day this is the product for you.
259	3	I have not bought this online but I know I've seen and bought the 24 packs in stores a lot cheaper and the individual cans a lot cheaper. Here the cans are almost 70 cents per can.  I think at the stores I pay 50 or 55 cents a can.  I think they have the 24 packs cheaper at the dollar store or Freds and I think Walmart but I only go there and in emergencies at night when everything else is closed but they are also about the only place that I've found that sells the tuna and egg flavor that my cat's really love.  I thought Amazon would have a cheaper price then most of the stores but you would probably pay 2 or 3 dollars extra then at the stores and if you couldn't get free shipping I don't know how much extra you would have to pay but all together it would probably be about 5 to 7 dollars extra then just buying it at the store.
260	2	Unfortunately I didn't notice this until I received the product.  I guess I'll be giving it away to friends & family that don't mind it.<br /><br />Tastes artificial like coffee creamer.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Sugar, Sweet Whey, Maltodextrin, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Cocoa (Processed With Alkali), Corn Syrup Solids, Non-fat Dry Milk, Natural & Artificial Flavor, Sodium Caseinate (A Milk Derivative), Salt, Mono and Diglycerides, Dipotassium Phosphate, Carrageenan, Soy Lecithin.
261	1	This product completely dissapointed me. Im doing the lemonade diet and i was looking so foward to this maple syrup sweeting my lemonade but boy was i wrong. as soon as i tried it tasted horrible. you get such a nasty after taste. i would never buy this again
262	5	I am huge pretzel lover.<br />These in my opinion, are the best tasting pretzels out there.<br />They are TRULY finger licking good.  Everybody I know who has tasted them raves about the flavor.  I don't think you could have found a better combination of flavors to add to a pretzel.  I've tried Hanover's other flavors but they don't come near this all time favorite.  I did have to stop buying and eating them because of health reasons, but when I did eat them, I would not be without any in  my house.
263	3	These salmon packets are convenient.  I travel to remote areas frequently and need to have shelf-stable food.  I appreciate having single-serve salmon packets because I don't want to eat tuna every day.  This provides some variety.  I have eaten several of these packets and don't recall a specific flavor from the seasoning.  I typically mix this salmon in with other foods, such as macaroni and cheese, or mix in crushed kale chips.  Packets are lighter than cans and fit in my limited luggage space better.
264	5	Buttercrisps, sesame, wheat--such a variety, and Grandma loves them all. We keep an extra package on the top shelf, just to look forward to! They came quickly, and none of them were broken.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZXJ9EW >Keebler Toasted Crackers, Three Assorted Flavors (8-Ounce each), 40-Ounce Box</a>
265	5	Love this pen as it made my drawing and colouring easier as it glides easily on my fondant.
266	4	One of my concerns with the K-cup brewers is that I wouldn't be able to get a good, strong cup of coffe, which I love.  It has taken a few orders of different varieties to find a strong one that has the right blend of bold, flavor and bitterness.  Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond meets most of that criteria pretty well.  It is a little more on the bitter side than I normally prefer, which I why I only gave 4 stars, but overall a great bold cup of coffee.  I would order this variety again.
267	4	An excellent european style cereal with low sugar, 7 gm per 2/3 cup,but with a high carb count of 40 gm per 2/3 cup. Lots of vitamins and very tasty.cereal
268	5	I found this tea while vacationing in Santa Fa, NM.  Was able for several years to purchase it locally, but not anymore.  It is great hot or cold. Wonderful flavor.
269	5	I bought a box of this product at a craft show and was inspired to buy a case. It is a pretty potent gingerbread, not subtle in any way. You won't want to eat this every day, but when friends come over, the kitchen will smell good and the flavor is enticing.
270	5	I am not a big fan of Hamburger Helper.  But my sister in law made this one night and I could have eaten the whole pan.  She cooks per package directions (sans the cheese sauce) and then places the cooked product in a casserole dish and tops with shredded cheese.  Bake for 20 minutes ( or when cheese melts)at 350 degrees.  We eat ours with Tostitos Hint of Lime chips.  This takes a little longer to make but worth it.
271	2	first of all after we bought this item we were told that we could buy this same item for 30 % less at a market near us also reading shipping weight of 4 oz. it was kind of miss leading thinking that we were getting 4oz. not 1 oz.
272	3	I was very excited to try this product, and although it tastes good, it does not fill me up like it claims to and I'm still hungry after drinking one. It is very expensive, so I don't think I will be buying it again.
273	5	Good stuff! Ordered this on AMazon-auto shipment because it was less expensive here than in stores. The prices in my local stores have come down some so it is now cheaper for me to buy it locally. Walmart sells it for $3.80 per box--good deal. This is a good product.
274	5	If you are a maple sugar candy lover, the question is frshness. Old, these can be like rocks. Fresh, they are an unbelievable treat with elegant mouth feel unlike any other candy.<br /><br />These arrived very fresh and were delicious. It was a good quantity for the price. I live in a part of the country where it is hard to find this product so I am delighted to get it through Amazon.
275	1	These cookies have no flavor. I think I will give the other 11 boxes to a food bank. Is that bad?
276	1	My chips arrived completely pulverized.  They were shipped with no extra packing.  Bummer
277	5	When I first received the coffee I wondered how a mix of light and dark would be anything different than just a regular medium brew coffee.  After tasting it I was hooked.  It has the rich dark taste with any bitterness and a smooth finish.  Very comfortable to drink yet bold.
278	5	My friend turned me on to some of Tom Douglas rub for a meal I was hooked , so I ordered some and it's almost gone already, Love it. Gary
279	5	Lakewood organic grape juice has an excellent, fresh, full-strength Concord grape flavor. It's actually pretty intense, which is a good thing if you like grape juice.<br /><br />In addition to it being organic, the big plus to me is that there are no added sulfites. Lakewood prints that in bold letters right on the front of the label.
280	5	The six pack is a good value, really no more than I'd pay for tea in the grocery store.  I LOVE this tea, it is much stronger and full bodied than  normal tea  and mixing the Earl Grey with lavender gives it a great taste. Most people would probably want to add sugar but as I have stopped drinking coffee, this is the right amount of slightly bitterness that works for me.  Much better than regular Earl Grey tea.  Have not tried the other flavors as I don't like fruity teas.  This stuff is great.
281	5	I love this flavor of coffee for the Keurig machine.  It's subtle and not too sweet.  My husband love his coffee super sweet, but I prefer mine black, and we can both enjoy this without adding anything to it.  I definitely think this particular item is a great value.  When a couple people make coffee daily, you can really go through the k-cups, and this product keeps us stocked.  When these arrived, there were one or two that had been damaged in transit, but it didn't really bother me.  I removed the broken cups and transferred the rest to our k-cup staging area.  Definitely a good buy.
282	4	Everyone keeps saying that these taste JUST like girl scout cookies, and I will admit that the taste is similar.  However, don't do what I did and, having never eaten a fiber bar, go into this expecting it to REALLY taste like a cookie.<br /><br />If you are on a diet, you know that you start to get used to foods that don't taste quite the same as their more fattening alternatives.  Well, this is a similar deal.<br /><br />Yes, they are good.  No, they aren't cookies.
283	3	These jelly beans taste as if they are full of sugar, but they are not. I must say the flavors were excellent!!  The only problem that any of us had was if we consumed more than a handful, we had very bad stomach problems.
284	5	Great and genuine product. I did not find any reason why this product deserves less than 5 stars. I first mixed one teaspoon with organic raw local honey, but that was too sweet for me.Now, i am using by mixing one spoon of this powder in one cup of boiled water without mixing any sweetener. My wife is drinking by mixing in warm almond milk. I am surprised to see single stars for this product just because the taste is not good to them. That is the taste of the original cocoa powder, what the company can do about it.
285	5	I tried this after having tried many chocolate/raspberry blends. Oh my! this is my favorite, perfect blend of the two flavors in a warm comforting cup. My husband who loves the GM wild blueberry says this is his new favorite! Thank goodness you get 48 cups in the order!! : )
286	5	If you're looking for a coffee that is kind to your stomach, you may wish to try this. I make decaf iced coffee each morning with almond milk, a tablespoon of cocoa and stevia for sweetener. This coffee is tasty, satisfying and smells good. I love hazelnut and french vanilla coffee so will be exploring any flavored coffees this company makes, along with this French Roast. I enjoyed it as a base for my daily iced coffee. What a great idea to design a low-acid coffee!
287	5	Whoever named then Maple Nut Goodies was a Genius! If you like maple and nuts you'll love these. They have the same flavor as a maple donut with peanuts on top, and I mean exactly the same. They're so awesome I'm now buying in bulk :-( and when I eat em its a handful at a time. No such thing as moderation with these. I just bought my 4th bag in as many months so I hope they keep selling them.<br />Thanks!
288	5	My daughter loves this food. This is her favorite of all the HappyBaby Organic Baby Food. I make all of her fruits and vegetables but decided not to continue this with the meats. She did great transitioning from the food I make at home to this packaged product so it must taste pretty fresh.
289	5	I brought a jar of the Maille Cornichons back from Paris this year and was determined to find some state-side.  I had read that the ones found in the states are made in Canada and not as good.  But, I found these absolutely delicious and will be buying more.
290	3	I like the pita chips, I do not have to feel too guilty about eating a crunchy snack when I have that craving.  It is also nice that they are put into portions to reduce the over eating mindlessly issue that everyone tends to have while snacking.
291	5	This is the 3rd meat grinder I have purchased, and the best by far.  We make our own raw diet for our cats, so a grinder gets<br />a real workout from us.  We grind at least 40# of meat at a time when we use it.  With the other two grinders we had to reverse the grinder several times because meat got hung up.  Also, we would have to let it  cool down .  With this one we have NEVER had to reverse it, and the motor stays cool.  We do shut it down several times so we can crack the chicken leg bones with a mallet (we were told to do that by the manufacturer) and we do a bunch of legs at a time.  I would recommend this grinder to anyone wanting a GOOD grinder that<br />doesn't hang up and have to be reversed or cooled down often.  This grinder is a real worker, and I would compare this with a grinder costing 3-4 times as much money.
292	5	Great instead of a protein bar. much tastier. Healthier???? Probably not look at the sodium content.<br />Since I dont care about my long term health I dont care, I'd rather have a good looking body when i finally kick the bucket.
293	1	My dog was on Canidae for almost 2 years and she loved it.  She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy.  Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.  We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.<br /><br />I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was!  It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!
294	5	This is great popcorn at a great price. I learned a lesson as well - don't buy the 8oz bags if you have a stove top hand crank popper - buy the 4oz. It's not easy splitting the 8 oz contents in 2.
295	4	I was looking for a jarred version of regular tomato paste for when a dish just needs the richness of a spoonful or two.  This paste is very delicious, but not what I had expected.  It contains sundried tomatoes, sunflower oil, vinegar and salt.  I haven't tried it yet, but it would probably be scrumptious on bruschetta, or as a layer in Italian sausage bread, etc.  Just not a substitute for Hunt's or Contadina.
296	5	This is the best  at home  popcorn I have found. It tastes almost like the popcorn at my local theater. Popcorn from the grocery store doesn't even come close. It is all pre-measured so very easy to use. My kids friends come over and immediately ask for popcorn. Guaranteed if there is a movie being watched at our house, we are making a batch (or more) of this popcorn. I can't even get rid of the microwave popcorn sitting at the back of my pantry now.
297	5	I am a marathon runner and diabetic.  I have spent years tinkering with different energy/meal bars and eventually settled with ClifBar--which is not bad, though it has many sugary ingredients like rice syrup, etc.  I was extremely excited to discover LaraBar, it is delicious, contains no added sugars and provides an excellent source of energy for training.  Definitely the best bar on the market!
298	5	I love Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice coffee. The blend of spices is just perfect. The coffee itself is never bitter. Just a smooth yummy taste. I never stop at the name brand coffee houses anymore as none of them can beat Green Mountain coffees.
299	5	I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in.
300	5	OK, summer sausage is always salty but to me, this one is particularly salty.  Not excessive mind you, but salt taste is strong.  Pepper but not a strong kick if that means anything to you.  I am no summer sausage expert but this one is pretty good and definitely affordable.
301	5	I love these. My daughter goes crazy for them. I have to make her stop from eating them all at one time.
302	5	Really nice flavor. I have it at night for a treat before bedtime. Really nice being able to make it at home instead of having to go to Starbucks and you can make it as strong as you like. True vanilla flavor, tastes like what vanilla extract smells like. Also great for company, after all, who doesn't like vanilla flavor.... Absolutely NO bitter after taste.
303	4	I Love the flavor Van Houtte french vanilla, it's not too strong and not bitter. makes a great morning start.<br />The price is right at $23.00 for 24 doesn't break the bank and delivers a great cup of coffee! I love the Shop and save also, it's just so handy.
304	5	This product has a receipe on the bottle for Key Lime Pie and it is easy to make and taste great. The juice also works well with Ice Tea and other receipes that call for lime juice. Seems to taste alot better than the brand name or generic lime juices at least that my opinion.
305	5	When I awaken in the morning, I make my way to the Mr. Coffee, fill the reservoir with water, add a couple of scoops to the coffee basket and when the coffee fills the carafe, I pour a cup and drink. I used this Maxwell house but if the truth be known, I buy whichever coffee is on sale.
306	5	In preparation for an international trip, where coffee quality would be uncertain, I bought a 12-pack at our local Starbucks store.  I like the quality and convenience so much that I use them at home.<br /><br />This is a very good price for the 50-pack, compared to packets bought in the store (12 for $9.95 = 83 cents each). Perhaps there is a similar discount on 50-packs purchased in the store but I've not seen 50-packs in any of the four Starbucks near us.
307	5	Bought these for cheap on amazon.  Easy to carry for long distance canoe racing events.  Flavor is decent and the caffeine adds a little kick that really helps after a few hours of paddling, especially the  iron  events.
308	5	They are Delicious! Great for snack, as crackers or chip.  Great for Gluten & Wheat free replacement.  I couldn't find the sea salt at the store anymore.  Found & bought them on Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!  And thanks Glenny's!<br /><br />Thanks Alvita
309	4	These were pretty good turtle-like chocolates.  The chocolate itself was good, not great.  The caramel was pretty smooth and creamy.  Granted, I'm comparing these to others that I've had and the best I've had which came fresh off the line at the Lindt & Sprungli Chocolate facility in NH during a tour of their facility.  I didn't expect these to beat those, but these were pretty good.  They were also fairly inexpensive in comparison to those made by Lindt.  With that said, I will order these again as they were very much enjoyed.
310	5	I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!
311	5	I love how soft the Quaker cookies are! Not only are they soft but they're delicious too. Grab one for a snack on the go, put in your kids lunch box, or just enjoy at home. They're great!
312	5	I love- prefer- my coffee with chicory which adds a mellowness and lowers the caffeine without hurting the taste.  However not all chicory root available is roasted and granulated.  This chicory is and can simply be added to a drip coffee maker along with the coffee.  I match it with a rich dark roast, and use a quarter to a third of chicory.
313	5	I think the first thing that got me looking at this was the way my wife made it.  Each serving has its own little  infuser  that sits over the lip of the cup. Incredible design... I was impressed.  Tried it and love it.  I guess I am a tea drinker now.<br /><br />The whole package and presentation smacks of quality... kind of like a Mercedes Benz... when you open the door it is like a vault and you climb in and smell that leather... the ride is great... then you get out and slam the door and that seals it... it is a vault.  This tea comes in a little metal vault... the vault door is 1/2  thick!  REALLY.  Good gift material for friends when they come over too... very nice... very high quality.
314	4	This is gourmet granola with a great chocolate taste.  The chunks of chocolate are actually that: real chunks of quality dark chocolate.  The granola itself is also really good---crunchy and with a great bite.<br /><br />It's not exactly health food, but a small handful makes a great snack between meals.
315	5	Popcorn drizzled in chocolate and caramel - wonderful snack.  Love the single serve portions too - great to carry to a ball game!
316	4	Rocky looks forward to getting the chews.  I hope they are helping with his oral hygiene.
317	4	Rating a coffee product is difficult because it's so highly personal.  This produces a pleasant cup, something I would not hesitate to serve to anyone.  Why four stars? I have a rather acute reaction to anything approaching a bitter taste -- and I found that this has the slightly bitter aftertaste one finds in many French roasts.  Served with food, I doubt I would notice it, but, served alone, it is more apparent.
318	4	My eyes bugged out when I saw the $7 shipping charge on a $12 hot sauce (perhaps because it is liquid?)<br />But I know we like the stiff.  A group at work use it to fix the bland cafeteria food.  Only takes a drop for a bowl of chilly or BBQ sauce.  Not just hot but has a decent flavor.  The mouth burn does not linger excessively long and does not hurt uh... on the other end. :P
319	3	This Wrigley's Green Apple gum has, to me, a distinctive and quite good Green Apple flavor for the first few seconds but then develops a slightly chemical taste that lingers. While it isn't so bad that it has to be spit out, it doesn't live up to taste at the start.<br /><br />Interestingly enough my son says he doesn't notice the chemical taste so it might vary from person to person, which might explain the mixed reviews.<br /><br />CFH
320	2	In deciding to buy this item, I read the other reviews and expected a few dented cans.  Yet, I wasn't prepared for what I got.  10 out of the 12 cans were seriously, seriously dented.  I do fully understand that this does not affect the food's safety or nutritional value, but really!  We all know that crushed pages and a torn cover do not affect a book's readability, yet Amazon would not be in business today if they applied the same care in storing and shipping to their books as they do to their canned food goods.  All supermarkets that don't have an on-site cannery deal with shipped cans, and storing cans. Amazon may be entering a retail sector that it cannot so far handle.<br />I just have to point out that even though it may have been easier to buy these off Amazon, it is certainly not cheaper (even with the subscription discount - BTW, I cancelled my subscription after unpacking the cans).  For in fact, they were so dented that no brick & mortar supermarket would think to sell these at anything more than half-off the price.  To see the amount of denting, I uploaded a photo to the product description page.<br />In terms of the product itself, it's something I've loved for a long time.  Just buy a single can of it at a grocery store and try it before buying the 12-pack.  Make sense?
321	5	This tea has the perfect flavor.  The orange chocolate is a subtle combination and a wonderful treat at the end of a long day.  The sachets make brewing a breeze (though keep in mind that they don't have an attached string to tie over the side).  I do consider this tea a little on the expensive side, but I think it's totally worth it given the taste.
322	5	These Pop Chips are great!  Love them, even low in WW points.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0 >Popchips, Original, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>
323	5	This is the best we have ever tried.  We have ordered twice now.  We even sent some to our best friends!
324	1	Do not buy this product in the bag if you are a lover of the International Coffee Italian Cappuccino in the can!<br /><br />IT IS NOT THE SAME AT ALL!<br /><br />I thought I'd be smart and get the stuff in the bag to save money and for the convenience but DON'T GO THERE!<br /><br />The stuff in the bag has a strong chocolate taste and is heavy, I'd rather drink hot chocolate than this, hot chocolate tastes much better.<br /><br />So, my point is keep buying International Coffee Italian Cappuccino flavor in the can and FORGET THE BAG STUFF, it's terrible.<br /><br />Hope this keeps you from making the same mistake that I did, now I'm going to sell the balance of my order on eBay!
325	5	One word, yummy.  It taste just like the cookie which I also love.  It's a great substitute for peanut butter with less calories.  If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it!
326	5	This item was recommended by Bill O'Riely and a very good tip it was.  Tasty, fast and good for you.
327	5	About it tasting like it has sand in it...that is what I liked about it...the texture!  Absolutely delicious!  It wasnt like sand but like tiny almond chunks.  (hmm...interesting)  I have already told my friends about it!  YUM!
328	5	I never saw the flowers, but my Mom reported that they were absolutely beautiful. She is 91 years young so I knew she had plenty of vases around her house so why pay for glass vases when she loves flowers. In fact, there were so many flowers that she used two vases. If my Mom loved them, they have to get a 5 star rating!
329	2	These are pretty interesting... They aren't that good at all. We bought them on a road trip, and landed at a hotel one night. All the fast food places were closed, so we ate what was left of our food... two packages of these. My daughter (who is GFCF) had opened them and spit them out... my sister and I ate them, and gagged... but, we were hungry (ha)...<br /><br />They have the pretzel crunch, but the taste is off...  Maybe if there was more salt.. or flavor..<br /><br />I wouldn't but them again.
330	2	My dog was pretty confused when I put this in his face. Whenever I do he'll lick it once or twice then step back and look at me like,  Can I have a real treat now?  At least he doesn't hate it, but he sure doesn't get excited about this whenever I pull it out.<br /><br />But don't go off my review alone, other dogs seem to like it. Just not my poodle.
331	4	I agree with the other reviewer that Amazon's current pricing (as of Feb 2011) is ridiculous, being about double what my local HEB sells the stuff for. Having said that, I gave a 4-star rating because I think the product itself is to be recommended (just don't buy it from Amazon unless they lower their price). Prep time is about 5 minutes, and the resulting pizza crust is quite good.<br /><br />While some purists may scoff at a pizza crust that's ready to cook just minutes after making the dough, in my experience this stuff is far better than any of the other  instant  alternatives (for instance, stay away from <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOD5M >Betty Crocker Pizza Crust Mix</a> unless you want your pizza crust to taste like it was made with bisquick).
332	4	these are the only snack crackers that have that real cheese flavor. good in soups, as a snack. you will like the great taste of Cheez-It crackers baked not fried
333	3	I did enjoy the snacks. Since I am diabetic there are few such snacks I can get away with and this one did not affect my blood sugar adversely. However the cost is more than I can justify. I will be canceling my next shipment.
334	5	Cookies are so good - they are very tasty, and go great with a cup of coffee. I bought a pound, and could have eaten the whole box at a single sitting, if I didn't have any self-control. In any case, I had to order another pound - maybe it's addictive.....
335	5	I don't keep refined sugar any more!  THIS is sugar the way it was meant to taste!
336	5	I don't doubt that Cheri's syrup is great and leave that issue as it is.  If however you have visited Arizona and have had a Prickly Pear Margarita in a bar or restaurant they most likely got their syrup from another source; the Cactus Candy Company, located in Phoenix. I got my information from the bar tender at the Phoenician who showed me the Cactus Candy gallon jug of syrup.  They sell it in gallon containers which you need if you entertain guests and continue to offer them Prickly Pear Margaritas.  Amongst my friends Prickly Pear Margaritas have just about eliminated the need to make any of the other flavors.  If you don't have a margarita machine I can help you make better than machine made drinks.<br /><br />For ease of storing and delivering I use the bucket approach.  This allows you to make the mix, freeze it and keep it on hand until guests come.  As frozen the mix is not appetizing.  There is considerable separation of the contents but it doesn't matter as all of the ingredients are together and at the right temperature.  The only thing needed is to thoroughly mix the contents.  For this you will need a commercial blender which means VitaMix or Blendtec (go checkout bars and do research if you must).  I have both and prefer the Blendtec.  These machines are loud and powerful and will quickly mix a pitcher of margaritas (do not overmix as it melts the mixture).  With respect to ingredients I have done the  made from scratch  method which I still prefer for margaritas on the rocks but for frozen drinks I think it is overkill.  When your taste buds are well chilled and you're on the verge of a  brain freeze  the difference between great ingredients and good ingredients is nil.  In the beginning I bought the  On the Border  bucket mixes at Sam's/Costco until I started looking at the costs.  The buckets are expensive but they are reusable.  I still use the same buckets but I now buy Costco Margarita Mix to use in them.  The small buckets hold 80 ounces of drink, 64 of mix and 16 of liquor.  To aid in measuring I have a large 32 ounce measuring cup and add the smallest amounts first.  For the non-alcoholic components use 8 ounces of prickly pear syrup with the remainder (56 oz.) being margarita mix and all poured into the bucket.  The Cactus Candy syrup is thick and very sweet so try following directions first before you experiment.  When in a hurry or serving those that aren't aren't truly your  closest friends  just add 16 ounces of tequila.  While I wouldn't use the cheapest booze there is no reason to exceed the Jos&eacute; Cuervo Especial level for frozen drinks.  At this point you will have satisfying drinks that everyone will rave about.<br /><br />For a little more effort you can improve the mix, but let's review the objectives.  First you have to maintain the desired mix/alcohol ratio:  not enough booze results in a bucket of ice, too much booze and your bucket will have nothing but liquid.  Your goal is to have a drink mixture that will freeze to the extent that ice forms but will never freeze solid.  I wanted to use some liquors to improve the taste but had to maintain the  magic ratio  and too this end I use the following:<br /><br />  2 oz of Grand Marnier<br />  2 oz of Licor 43 (Cuarenta y Tres)<br />  4 oz of Everclear<br />  8 oz of tequila<br /><br />The Grand Marnier adds a fruitier note and the Licor 43, a Spanish liquor is used because it seems to heighten the taste of everything.  The Everclear keeps the alcohol in balance while the tequila completes its namesake.  I can taste the difference between the two but you or your friends may not.  The Licor 43 isn't cheap (about $40) so the experiment is for rich or the bold.  I generally keep 4 buckets of prickly pear mix in the freezer should a party breakout without notice.  Should the mix start to melt such that it can't be served return it to freezer and there should be little that is wasted.  Between the cold and the alcohol it should be safe to drink a long time.  I wouldn't know as my inventory turns over pretty rapidly with the help of guests.<br /><br />Lastly, keep a big pitcher handy during the blending.  The blender cannot mix the whole bucket in one go so do half, pour it in the pitcher then do the other half and finally pour both back into the bucket.  At this point the bucket contents will be well mixed so you can refill the pitcher, put the bucket back in the freezer and start serving guests.  If you are outside and it is humid there should be some frost around the drinking straws.  This indicates that the contents are well below freezing and the mix/alcohol ratio is in the right neighborhood.  I prefer the smaller (64 oz.) buckets as they are easier to store in my side by side refrigerator and the big buckets make a mess as you are trying to get all of the mixture blended using 2 pitchers.  if you use the 96 oz. buckets scale (multiply everything by 1.5) appropriately.<br /><br />Excessive consumption may occur so be prepared for overnight guests but may have benefits:  some discover singing and dancing talents long hidden, women may wake up next to a guy with a hairy back that they didn't like anyway and men may develop a new approach for that pretty girl that had previously threatened to call the police.  Enjoy
337	5	I can eat 2 of these as compared to 4-5 of the regular ones. Others also eat fewer of these  as well. They stay nice & crunchy because they don't last very long on anyones plate. I recommend these if you have big appetites in your home.
338	5	This popcorn is terrific!  It pops up very fluffy but on the smaller side and with a lot less hulls.  Has a really great taste to it!
339	5	I use this in my greek yogurt (Fagee) with organic honey for breakfast. This stuff is awesome. It's really fresh, and there are no  surprising  grains that find their way into my mouth. You can open the bad and immediatley smell the freshness of their grains. I love it. The taste isnt too sweet, just right. This grain also sticks with you throughout the morning. It's a bit high in carbs, but it's worth it for me.
340	5	I love love love these and would really like a bigger bag.  24 one ounce bags is ok, but would like to choose my own portion.  They came very fast and were in perfect condition.
341	4	I bought a variety of these cups to use as Christmas presents for my co-workers.  I included some samples of loose leaf teas.  Everybody raved about the cups, so I had to go back and order one for myself!  The cup is wonderful.  One tiny flaw is that it doesn't have a handle.  The cup is pretty well insulated so it doesn't get dangerously hot, but it is hard to hold for very long until it has a bit of time to cool.  But I use boiling water straight from the kettle, so that might not be a problem for some people.  The strainer piece is the best part.  It is really big so you can brew the tea nice and strong, and it has a little handle that hooks on the cup.  Plus it's deep as well as wide, so the tea leaves get well into the water without having to overfill the cup.  And it works with most of my other mugs as well!  All in all, this is a great product, and a wonderful gift for anyone who likes tea.
342	4	Mariani's Tropical Medley of dried fruits is a delicious mix.  My kids and I absolutely love it.  There are all kinds of different colors, flavors,and textures here, as the medley includes pineapple, apricots, papaya, raisins, golden raisins, apples, and coconut.  I would have given this product five stars, but it does have added sugar and yellow dye number 6.  Still, it's a great snack and a far better choice for a sweet craving than candy!
343	4	These are very good, but in the very warm weather the filling can go soft.<br />So I keep mine in the freezer.  Try and keep them sealed to avoid moisture -<br />all I do is fold the silver packet over - and they are really good. There<br />is not enough to them to taste cold - but they are crisper.  I only keep<br />the packet I have open in the freezer.  See what you think.
344	1	We threw this garbage straight in to the trash. As far as our dog was concerned, he would rather eat sticks right of the tree branches than these crummy things.
345	5	This extra bold coffee is one of our favorites.  The  extra bold  could be compared to a bold coffee in a regular coffee brewer.
346	5	This item works  out great!!!Keeps everycup of coffee at your fingertips, and definitely looks good sitting on my unclutterd counter.!!  Quick ship...AAAA+++++
347	2	I had this product on a layover in Hawaii it is the best li hing mui I have ever had and was born and raised in Hawaii.<br />  There is a massive   BUT  here in that the order was placed 5 days ago and it has not even shipped yet! Their customer survice is a 1and the mui a 9 for a net 5 overall rating. It will be interesting to see if the company sends it by a faster shipping method to make up for their delay.
348	5	Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood.
349	5	This is the best Hot Chocolate I have bought.  I wish we discovered it the first time we went to Costa Rica. We brought about 9 of these home on our last vist for gifts.  I wish we could have brought more. Britt also makes more flavors in the hot chocolate, but I have only found the straight hot chocolate and mint hot chocolate on line.
350	5	I received 3 sample bottles of 5-Hour Energy from Smiley 360...and LOVED this product! I loved how the taste was pleasant and there was no strong aftertaste like most products have. It also was fast acting, gave me the energy I needed and I never experienced that 'crash' you would get with caffeine or sugar. I am not a coffee drinker, and have tried to stay away from caffeine because I always seem to feel worse off than I did before taking it. But with 5-Hour energy, I can use it as often as I need and don't have to worry about regretting it later! It also got me through most of my (BORING) day at work without making me jittery or jumpy. Thanks 5-Hour Energy! You have got a fan for life!! :-)<br /><br />(I received a free sample of 5-Hour Energy from Smiley360.com)
351	5	Bought these to replace the Equisicat crystals and Heartfelt beads in my fridgadors and couldn't be happier. They are crystal clear, round, hold water well, self regulate around 70% RH (68 RH for me), have zero smell and are a priced right. I can't get these around the Bay Area in CA, only Equisicat crystals and like these much better. The are identical to beads that costs much more that are marketed specifically for cigar but is essentially the same product for all intensive purposes.
352	2	Wow I bought a box of 12 packages based on the other positive reviews but I am so sorry. These are basically tasteless. They're very very gummy/chewy, barely resemble frogs and are just generically sweet. I'm going to find people to give the remaining 11 bags away to. So sorry I bought these. If you are expecting anything like regular gummy candies, these are not them!
353	3	Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste?
354	1	These look delicious and when you first chew, they are delicious. But it did not take long before I started feeling nauseated and ill. There is also a terrible aftertaste that lingers for a while. Be careful.
355	5	Although we are not enthusiastic seafood eaters, this tartar sauce really makes all the difference; it's rich and creamy. We had purchased one bottle locally, but could never find it again so we decided to just buy a dozen bottles.  This tartar sauce is not the least expensive one, but the taste makes it worth the price.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LLIV9U >Louisiana Tarter Sauce, 10.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>
356	4	I have only made this coffee in my drip maker, which does not produce a brew as tasty my french press or stove top burner. It produces a decent cup that is good and not bitter, but also does not have an abundance of character.
357	5	Very few things are better than a GREAT cup of coffee. Marley coffee , although pricey , very much hits that mark. Smooth , no bitter taste , or aftertaste. I would go broke enjoying it every day , but I will purchase it when entertaining family and friends
358	5	This is a fabulous bread mix.  It makes a 2 lb loaf at the price of a 1 lb loaf from the store and much better.  The only alteration to the instructions was to  proof  the yeast before mixing.  I put 3/4 c warm liquid (milk, etc.) w/1 of the tablespoons of sugar in a cup w/yeast while I mix the other ingredients.  This bread doesn't need to be toasted and makes great sandwiches.  My family and friends have eaten it at my house and enjoyed it.  I have used it since they introduced it last year and don't bother with other mixes anymore.  Their other products I have tried (cornbread and brownies) are the best.
359	5	In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!<br /><br />These little treats are wonderful.  I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).<br /><br />Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients.  As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took).  Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable!  The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min).  With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!<br /><br />Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him).  He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique.  This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars).  I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone.  He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats.  It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product.  If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.<br /><br />Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?
360	3	After I got the techno gummis along with this I was amazed at how unique the techno gummis taste was and was expecting about the same thing with the mini-frogs, but except for their marshmallow bellies the mini-frogs were just the same as the gummi bears you get at the store and in all to me they were like the shark gummis I can get at the convenient stores as well.  The bag is humongous and holds a great quantity so kudos for that but still I felt a little cheated that for this price I just got what amounted to five pounds of marshmallow gummi bears, and while I loved the techno gummis and have ordered another bag seeing as how my family and I have almost finished the bag I really doubt I will reorder this again unless the price goes a little more down to a reasonable price for this usual treat that's pretty much available at almost every store....
361	5	Great size for a quick snack and not only do they taste great but are good for you. I think they are also great for kids.
362	5	This is a delicious chai. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the chai, so it's a nicely balanced tea. I'm a big fan of Rishi teas and I appreciate their chai selection and that the teas are available in three-packs at a reasonable price from Amazon.
363	5	ok its preety self explainatory  caffine powder with stieva( a plant based sweetner)  the stevia  almost made me not buy it  (bad experiance)  how ever i really wanted this product real bad i was searching caffine related products on facebook and ran across blast powder  and i must say im sure glad that i did . i absolutely love blast powder its 300 mg of pure caffine thats like about 3 cups of coffee in a little sweet heavenly lil package. so amazing  i would recoomand like blast powder does as well putting it into oj or my personal fav diet mountain dew or something like that,it does have a bitter taste on its own due to the stevia however its not too terrible.  once youput it into a drink and mix it up well its more then great. no crash for sure  like the batterry bunny go and go and go  i highly reecomend  blast powder
364	1	Plant arrive in a protective box looking very healthy.The soil was very wet and within a few days the branches rotted away. I repotted what was left of the plant but it was too late. I have purchased from this company before with great results but will never purchase live plants from them again.
365	5	Thank you to the reviewer that said this was like the coffee from the gas station machines.  I love that coffee!  I must say though, it is less sweet than the gas station machine coffee.
366	4	i've gotten all three flavors now and i have to say the lima citron is better the rest. i like the citrus taste.
367	5	I've seen these around but all the negative press told me it wasn't worth the agony of trying to choke these stinky slimy suckers down. Anyway, practicing the reasonable-carb lifestyle, I rarely eat pasta but miss the convenience of pasta dishes for lunch.  Wondering if they were really *that* bad, I busted out the fiver I had burning a hole in my pocket and bought two bags. Ready for the most horrendous smell that had ever invaded human nostrils, I opened the bag and held my breath.  No sirens went off, the cats were still walking around and life appeared to go on, so I let my guard down and decided to take a breath while the noodles and I were in the same room.  Silly me, I thought to myself.  I've been fooled by the drama of Amazon reviewers.  Sure they do have a smell, but steaming up some brussels sprout will leave you worse off. A 30-second generous rinse of hot water in my favorite yellow Tupperware strainer yielded a healthy portion of stench-free noodles.  Then I decided to do what no man has dared to do before! I reach into the strainer with my index finger and opposable thumb, pinched a tablespoon-sized serving of plain hot rinsed noodles, and stuck them directly in my mouth! O.M.G.... nothing happened.  So I made my spaghetti and had a great day.
368	5	I'm currently on a high protein, low carb diet (Ideal Protein Diet).  Carbs were restricted, but as I'm allowed to work them back into my diet, this is one condiment that is allowed (One Carb Heinz).  Before now, I tried the Walden Farms ketchup and that was pretty bad - but this Heinz tastes just like their regular ketchup only it's low carb, reduced sugar - so it's less bad for you.  I will say that this item is available in most Walmart stores for $2.88 per bottle, which sure beats having to buy in bulk OR having to pay for shipping.  So if you choose to try this product, I suggest getting it at Walmart.
369	5	I adore hot in my foods and was pleasantly surprised to find these as part of a Yummy Earth assortment.  They were my absolute favorite flavor and I saved them for myself.  Eating two at a time really broke out a sweat..they can be hot.  Really great flavors although I prefer the lime..yum!  Highly recommend for those who like a little spice in their life...
370	5	This is the best crust next to having the real thing. I make it thin and its great even my family that does not have to eat gluten free like it.
371	4	This was my first time ordering a Japanese candy, from Kracie, to be exact. I was so excited to receive it after watching many YouTube videos about it. I must say, it was so much fun to make this! Don't worry if you don't know Japanese, as you can either watch instructional videos from YouTube or follow the pictures, as they are thourough.<br /><br />All of the different ingredients smelled wonderful. The rice smelled like bubblegum. The egg and meat smelled faintly like mango. The seaweed smelled like grape. The fish eggs and soy sauce smelled a bit like mango, but more of a fruitier smell.<br /><br />Now for the taste. I loved the taste of each one, as they weren't overpowering. But the textures are what really displeased me. The rice was really cool because of the feel in my hands, but in your mouth it tastes kind of stiff and grainy. I think that the worst texture was the meat and egg. They were so grainy that I could barely swallow them, and to top it off they were on top of the rice. Yuck!<br /><br />The best taste and texture had to be the fish eggs. They are little gel balls, just like that product from a long time ago that Listerine made. It was breath freshener  mints , that were in the gelled ball form, and they exploded with liquid when you bit them, making your mouth feel fresh. I actually ended up saving the fish eggs instead of putting them on the sushi because I liked eating them. Also, the soy sauce and the mixture that you put the fish eggs in tasted wonderful, with that faint fruity taste.<br /><br />The product shipped the day after I order it (standard shipping), and came a week later (the first estimated delivery date). I was very happy about that, especially since it shipped from Japan.<br /><br />Overall, I think if you are considering it, buy it! It is such a fun way to make candy. Just beware of the rice, meat, and egg after you make it!
372	4	I recently tried the Zola Acai with Pomegranate juice and thought it was very good.  For a juice that's packed with so much good stuff (antioxidants), it was smooth, not too thick, and not too sweet (although I could have gone for a bit more tangy).  The 12 oz bottle is perfect for taking to work or the gym.  The juice was good in the morning and also as an afternoon pick me up.  I appreciate that it is packed with so many vitamins and minerals and contained no added sweeteners, etc.  super healthy and I would buy it again for sure.
373	5	The secret to making any of these miracle noodle or no-oodle products edible and actually good is to DRY FRY them. They will smell VERY strongly of fish when you open them, but after a good rinse of cold water in a colander, the smell goes away. After they are rinsed, all you have to do is put them in a heated skillet and cook off the extra moisture,about 2-3 min. Then, add whatever sauce or ingredients you want. I have had the best success with mixing in some teriyaki marinade, grilled beef, and broccoli. It was truly delicious. I tried them plain and then with some beef broth and really did not enjoy them, so keep experimenting until you find what works best for you. But definitely dry fry them and it will improve the texture and be a nice treat if you are avoiding carbs and calories.
374	5	I have a lab and he loves these biscuits.  They are the perfect size for training, even the big dogs.
375	1	I should have read the product description better. The artificial sweetner in the Lemon Lime mix creates a drink along the lines of Diet Sprite (or other lemon limey diet drinks). If you like diet lemon lime, then it's probably fine. I don't.
376	5	I bought these last month as part of an Amazon promotion - buy 5 items get %40 percent off.  I had never heard of this product, but have a soft spot in my belly for the snacks I grew up on as a kid.  These things turned out way better than expected.  They are essentially pork rinds from your typical supermarket, but they are fresh - still crackling and popping after you open the bag.  I'm addicted to these now and have had to ratio them out so I don't eat them every night.  They're THAT good.
377	5	The Prince of Peace Instant Ginger Honey Crystals originally didn't impress me because the first ingredient was cane sugar, followed by honey and then ginger.  Because we don't drink many sweet beverages, the 70 calories and 17 sugar grams seemed outrageous.  We also were not thrilled with the biblical proverbs imprinted on the packaging.  After opening the first pouch, however, our family was hooked on the spicy sweet crystals.  Each pouch contains 12 grams of ginger and it is very, very spicy, just what we like around here.  We empty a packet into a little jar and always have some accessible in the kitchen.  I use a little binder clip on a packet in my bag when traveling, so I can slip a few crystals on my tongue even when there's no water available.  I add this to white or green tea, mix it in my chai and add no other sweetener, sprinkle it on yogurt, fruit and fiber cereal in the morning, and even have used it to tone down an overly spicy seafood stew I made last week.  I don't know how, but throwing in about a half teaspoon worked a miracle.  The hot beverage is great when we're nauseous or just feeling less than perfect, and when chilled, is a perfect complement to one of those clear beverages we may drink for relaxation.  If you like ginger, think about taking a break from the ginger chews/candy and try these little delectable crystals instead.
378	5	for my daughter and she loved the bars.  Nice and crunchy with a great nutty, chocolate taste.  She shared them with friends on a trip and had to hide them so they wouldn't all be eaten.  I have given the friends the manufacturer name and steered them to Amazon to order them
379	5	I cannot find this coffee anywhere except on amazon.  Came to love it while living in Hawaii.  I love amazon
380	4	I purchased this at a local warehouse club. I added to 1 pouch French Vanilla Blend extract (2 tsp.) and used a stick of room temperature butter. I did not melt the butter per instructions but I did add the 1 egg. Using a small sorbet scoop I rolled a small ball of dough and pressed it onto a plate of colored sugar, holly sprinkles and pareil multi-colored balls; all separately. I put 12 on a sheet of parchment on a baking pan and baked for 14 minutes at 350* F. They were very tasty. It was quick and easy. Now I know what to make when going over to a friend's house to hang out. The pouch made about 29 medium sized cookies. Almost 2 1/2 dozen. I won't give it a five bc I feel I shouldn't have to add French Vanilla Blend in order for them to taste yummy. That should already been in the mix. But then again, this mix is versatile. You could add peppermint extract and roll the balls in crushed peppermint candies. For another pouch I plan to add white chocolate chips and chopped macademia nuts, with a tiny dash of butterscotch extract. So maybe I should rate it a five. Nah,... the ingredients aren't organically-certified -that would rate a five star rating!!
381	3	The  experts  say that the k-cup method of making coffee is wonderful for its ease and quickness and makes a very nice brew for those that like favored and/or medium roast coffee, but is not capable of making a robust cup for those that like their brew powerful!! I would have to agree!! I have tried just about every dark roast, french roast, italian roast coffee sold by Amazon and the only one that comes close to robust, in my opinion, is Coffee People's  Wake-Up Call .  Dark Magic  has a sweetness to it, which is not to my taste. Overall, OK, but not a winner in robust flavor!!
382	5	I've not used it for making the good ole PB&J sandwich yet, but I've used it for cooking, making a smoothie and in pudding...and it's great!  2 TBSP in a package of sugar-free chocolate pudding, add a little Cool Whip and you've got a super easy lo-cal dessert.<br /><br />The people that make this have receipes on their site that sound very good as well.  This is a definite  will buy again !
383	2	I thought I would give this one a try as I usually order Timothy's French Vanilla. I thought I would get a much richer vanilla flavor due to the  supreme  on the label. I was disappointed. I has quite a nice aroma but the taste was lacking. There was a bitter after taste. I tried three separate cups...each having that strange after taste. I gave up. Timothy's plain old French Vanilla is much better than this  French Vanilla Supreme .
384	5	I love these chips. I am on the subscribe and save and get a case every two months, but have to order more often because i eat a bag with my lunch every day. they are very tasty and great for a snack if you are on weight watchers! give them a try!
385	1	I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.  We were wrong.  This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.
386	2	I first bought this at the price of 7.68 for 4 boxes with free super saver shipping...it is very good cereal but 14 dollars as price is now, is crazy and a RIPOFF!
387	5	Just have to say that the treats are great for training. They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.
388	5	Even if you think you know Italian dry mushrooms -- order these and find out how wrong you were.  Unbelievably beautiful, deeply fragrant, terrific huge intact slices.  Flip all the cards over: these completely redefine the category.  Not just for sauces: soak a few to garnish your steak.  Make a knockout appetizer with these porcini, some stock and a shot of marsala.  To top it all: the price is reasonable.  Bravo!
389	5	This is an all around product.  If you need to go to the bathroom, this is the product for you.  It may take two doses but you will surely get things out of your system.  Easy on the belly also!!!
390	5	great deal great flavor it came with few breaks, I would buy again, you can get your rocks off with this sealed good
391	1	This is without a doubt the worst concoction that we have ever tried and I am amazed that anyone can stomach it. Nothing but a bland mix of goo with tons of pepper and spices added to cover it up. Same applies to the other Shore Lunch meals we tried! Do yourself a favor and leave them alone!
392	5	I've noticed that the shorter Slim Jims taste different and better than the longer Slim Jims. I prefer these.
393	5	I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.  My back-up is the Columbian, always good, but I have always loved Sumatra.  The cherry is a note, and does not come across as a 'flavor'.  I do not like flavored coffee.  I heat this in the microwave for two minutes in a mug of 1% organic milk.  Yummy!<br /><br />Starbucks writes:  . . .  Spicy & Cherry  and  With beans from all three of the world's coffee-growing regions . . . Aged Sumatra, sun-dried beans from Ethiopia, and coffees from Papua New Guinea and Colombia come together to create this spicy and full-bodied blend with dark cherry notes. 
394	1	$20 for 12 taco shells? you can buy 20 tacos at taco bell for that price (including tax in most locales)
395	5	I've been taking this for over a year before going to bed and have not had any problems going to sleep or staying asleep at night since I've started taking it.  According to the experts, it's one of the most important minerals for asthmatics to take because it relaxes the bronchial tube muscles hence either eliminating or reducing bronchial tightness/restriction.  Although my asthma has been asymptomatic for quite some time, the magnesium is good to use for so many other reasons and to maintain my health.  It's also a natural laxitive and helps prevent indigestion.  This is 100% natural elemental magnesium citrate so there is no need to worry about taking in any strange chemicals as you would when taking a synthetic vitamin supplement.
396	5	Best product I have found for a filling, no cal breakfast that sticks to the ribs.
397	5	This tea tastes awesome (especially with honey in it) and is so good for you. I love it, and you will too!
398	5	I cannot recommend this highly enough...I think this product has given my old boy a needed boost.....he is a twelve year old Black Lab with the usual hip problems. After a few days he perked up and is moving around MUCH better.....this has been a lot more effective than powdered glucosamine....made a real difference!
399	5	This tea has just the right amount of sweetness.  I like matte tea medium strength (1 tblsp per cup) and it is not too sweet at this strength.  I drink it both hot and cold and it ids definitely a pick me up caffeine drink without the alkaloids of coffee.  I drink both coffee and this at different times for a change.
400	1	I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.
401	1	Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the  voluntary  recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through  other  means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.
402	1	When I got these in the mail I was quite excited to finally partake in their goodness.  After all, I have had quite the cavity problem over the years and I figured I had to do something to save my dentist the despair that struck over his face every time I walked into his office.<br /><br />Nearly immediately upon receiving them I took the bag with me down to my home theater and ripped them open with a child-like craving.  I popped them in my mouth one by one, careful to roll them around with my tongue and over and back and fro between my gums, lips and tongue.  I relished how soft and plyable they were and the taste was exquisite.  I could not believe that I was experiencing nirvana from a sugar free product.<br /><br />About an hour into the movie however, things started to change and before long, it was as if the gates of he11 opened up in my room.  I could almost swear I saw the hand of Bealzibub himself reaching forth from the depths of a gaping, red fissure that had become of my rectum, claws and all scraping any which way they could to cause pain.  I was doubled over in agony--if the weatherman had come on television that evening I am sure there would have been a flash-mudslide advisory warning issued in my home as that is exactly what had happened.  My guts were on fire.<br /><br />I ended up creating a tar-pit that labrea would have been proud of.  If it were not for my beautiful wife, I could have become quite entombed within my abode and fossilized in the times gone by.  I will say this though, Haribo would _not_ reimburse us for damages to our door when my Wife came home and the brown flood of goop shot out through the narrow slit that she had created by turning the knob, busting it from its hinges into her.<br /><br />These gummy bears are an exquisite deficacy.
403	4	Like everyone else, the product is great.  Love it for my hair, skin, etc. (don't use it for cooking).  HOWEVER, getting it out of the bottle is another story.  I softened it by sitting the bottle in hot water then poured about half of it in another container that I can just dip my fingers into.  Sometimes, you have to scrape a handfull out and let your own body heat melt it so you can apply it.  Other than that, very pleased.
404	5	This is the second time I've bought this product.  Works great in Oxo salt grinder.  Adds great variety of flavor to food by giving foods different taste depending on how small the salt crystals are.
405	5	Excellent coffee, very strong/bold.  Packaging is simple, efficient, no hassle.  Auto delivery program is on time, convenient, saves money.
406	3	I bought this in the vanilla cause the nutritional profile seemed good for hubby (who has trouble keeping weight on since we ditched most starches). He's not much into chocolate-milk type things. I got the case today, chilled a few, and tasted it.<br /><br />There's that weird aspect to the taste--first kinda like bacon, then sorta green. It's really unpleasant in the first sip. Fortunately, after a few more sips, you start to get used to it and can get the vanilla vibe better. I'm assuming it's the veggie component in there making me cringe at first--since I don't normally have veggie smoothies masquerading as vanilla shakes. I like my veggie smoothies overtly, unapologetically veggie-green. I like the taste of the Green Magma or Green Goddess type smoothies  that have spinach, celery, cucumber, parsley, etc. :) (Don't know why my first sip of Orgain hollered,  bacon!  at me, but there it is. Offputting.)<br /><br />The shake is thin--watery even. NOT creamy or thick.<br /><br />I could drink this if I needed unto. I've had some protein shakes that made me gag. This did not, it went down easily, no weird slimy texture, no weird chalkiness, just that odd smoky/then/green vibe. It's not something I could say was tasty.<br /><br />Maybe the chocolate flavor hides that weird taste thing going on better than the vanilla. I like the Amazing Grass that has the cocoa, so I could see that working. Still,  I doubt I'll order it to find out. I hope hubby likes this flavor. I don't really want to finish this case.
407	5	One of the best Kona Coffee I've had ever bought! Aromatic & smooth! No bitterness at all! Our family enjoy this coffee every day! Thanks a lot! free fast shipping!
408	2	I was looking for a food that had ingredients without corn or by products in it, (which is hard to find), so I was excited when I came across Wellness food. I have been feeding my cats Wellness canned food for years now but decided to finally try them on the dry food. I tried the Wellness dry salmon food on my cats, my parent's cats & even my sister's. Not 1 of the 9 cats would even taste it! I left this food out for 3 days for my cats but they literally starved themselves that whole time! I really had high hopes for this food but Wellness needs to come up with a healthy recipe that cats like.
409	5	Dark chocolate masterfully prepared with that lingering chili sensation that makes this a dream choice for those that love dark chocolate with a little kick to it.  The chocolate playfully teases the senses to wanting more.  If you're not careful, you will find it difficult to simply eat a bar slowly over time.  Some will say that chocolate is not an addiction, but I can't help but want more.  I love this Chili Dark Chocolate.
410	5	I typically get these bars at race expos but ran out and needed some to take on a trip.  They were a great price,  delivered on time.  I really love this product.
411	3	I have used this strong lengths conditioner for a couple weeks now and I would consider it very average. I don't dislike it but there simply isn't anything about this conditioner that makes it special. It conditions my hair and makes it soft but not as soft as many other conditioners. I also don't really care for the smell of this conditioner. I prefer something that smells either minty, tropical or fruity. This just smells like plain conditioner. Overall I really like Clear Scalp & Hair products but not this specific conditioner.
412	5	I am sure my dog could do a better review but seeing as he can't type, I will try to translate.  My dog(Welsh Terrier) is actually a very picky eater and only likes a handful of things.  Believe it or not, he loves these treats and can't get enough of them.  Of course all dogs are different, but typically, if my dog is happy, your dog will be happy.<br /><br />Now for what I love about this product:<br />- the medium size bone is a perfect treat for a medium sized dog (25-35 lbs)<br />- if you want to break them into pieces (for training or just to give a small treat), it is easy to do.<br />- thes bones don't break into a billion crumbs when your or the dog cracks into them<br />- they have relatively no smell, yet my dog still loves them - they must have great flavor<br />- My dog has problems with tartar build up.  These bones appear to help reduce the tartar and certainly don't add to any build up.<br />- One box seems to go a long way.  I don't treat my dog everyday but my first box is still half full.  I am guessing around 50-75 bones in a new box
413	5	Really enjoyed as long as your follow the directions of 5oz water to 2 TBSP of mix. Only 120 calories per serving which is nice.
414	3	the package arrived. seven of the bottles were partially full, and one was completely empty. Photos of the box were sent to Amazon. All the bottles were still sealed, but had severely leaked. My house smelled like smoke for 2 days. the product itself seems ok, but does not impart the taste as well as expected. Is this because they were sealed in a way that not only allowed them to leak, but to lose potency. Will probably not order again.
415	5	Excellent crawfish. Packed well.  Looking forward to cooking it.  This is is is is is is is good.
416	3	The store where I used to purchase black licorice-covered chocolate pieces (Lakrit's brand) doesn't carry them anymore, so I was glad to find something that I thought would be comparable.  This brand, however, is not comparable in my opinion and is not of the same high quality as the Lakrit's.
417	2	I ordered these oats several times in the past couple of years and there had never been a problem --- until my last order. They were not the same whole grain oats I had received before. They seemed more processed and fluffier and lighter in texture, not the heavier whole grain type. I noticed it right away after fixing my first bowl. I went ahead and ate them anyway but I don't think I'll order oats here again.<br /><br />I understand that this could have been an isolated case, but just wanted to inform any future buyers. It's too bad because they had been great until now.
418	5	All I can say is yummy. I would eat them when I would go over to england with my parents.<br /><br />I opened up a can and the aroma alone took me back many years ago.<br /><br />Love the beans.
419	5	I've been drinking 20 ounce diet sodas with lunch at work for years now. Recently, the prices got cranked up from $1.00 per bottle to $1.25. Combine this with recent reports that the phosphoric acid in diet drinks can rot your teeth, and I knew it was time for a change.<br /><br />My wife likes to buy the 50 pound pallet of Diet Snapple from Costco, but that costs and weighs too much and takes up too much space. Plus, you're paying for all of that packaging, which isn't very earth-friendly. Powder stix change all that. I have them shipped directly to my desk at work and re-use my 24 ounce shaker bottle each time. The cost is a mere 25 cents per serving when you buy 60 here at Amazon.<br /><br />But how's the product, you ask? It's delicious and it makes me feel good that I'm enjoying the benefits of green tea. How much, I don't know, but I know it's way better than soda. Bye bye, soda!
420	1	Season Skinless-Boneless sardines used to be of great quality and value, but for the past year or so they have been almost inedible.  I don't know what happened, but the sardines are huge, have a strange dark color, and smell and taste disgusting.  They were a staple of my diet, so this recent precipitous decline in quality is very disappointing. These companies need to learn that it does not pay to cut costs and jip customers.  I'd rather pay more money for something that's palatable, than this awful stuff that they are now putting in their cans.
421	5	Sweet, not crispy or too chewy, these cookies are some of the best iced oatmeal cookies that I have ever tasted. Similar in taste to Mothers(tm) Iced Oatmeal cookies only not as stiff and they don't taste like plastic.<br /><br />For all of you Vegans out there: I am not sure if the cookies are completely Vegan. These cookies are not listed on their site as being Vegan but I could not find any animal derived ingredients (aside from the mysterious  Natural Flavors ). You can find more information on their site: [...]<br /><br />Overall these cookies taste excellent! They truly are the icing on the cookie!
422	4	Tried many coffee lately, from the specialty ones to the grocery brands. By far this one is my fave and yeah I'm glad that my fave one is from my local Vons store. As long as you got the right ratio, it's amazing. I use the Aeropress, it's so easy to get the right tweak on this one, I've been drinking it over and over again with half&half and couple tsp of sugar.
423	5	Great deal, fast shipping.  Saved a lot buying these biscuits through Amazon - These biscuits are four dollars more a box at Pets Smart and other pet stores.
424	4	I think it would be more appropriate for my cat to be reviewing this product. But since he's busy with creative endeavors, I suppose my opinion will have to do.<br /><br />It's cat food. The cat eats it. It doesn't make him puke nearly as often as some foods with artificial colorings in them. When his dish is empty, he seems to request more of it.<br /><br />The quantity here will last about 2 months, give or take a week, used at the average rate of 2 handfulls per day.
425	5	I discovered this tea at a local coffee shop. This is undoubtedly the best tasting mint tea that I can recall drinking. The mint flavor is much stronger than the ordinary peppermint tea that I buy in the supermarket.<br /><br />However this is not peppermint tea, but a combination of mint flavors. The result is amazing.<br /><br />The coffee shop served a huge 16 oz cup of tea. When I finished the first cup, I asked for a refill of hot water, and there still was enough strength left in the tea bag for another great cup of tea.<br /><br />If you like mint tea that is robust, then you will love this tea.<br /><br />Note: The rating on this product has unfairly been lowered by earlier reviews complaining about the price. However, the current price on Amazon of ten dollars plus a dollar for shipping is actually less than the current price with shipping on the Mighty Leaf website.
426	1	The real ingredients is not listed by amazon. After buying the product, I found that it contains Tuna oil (source of DHA). This should have been mentioned by Amazon, and they are refusing when I requested refund. Disappointed in Amazon customer service for the first time.
427	4	This breath mint is hard, like coal, not chewy.  Fortunately, it doesn't taste like coal; it tastes like the strongest black licorice you'd ever want and maybe more.  I wouldn't have guessed there is any sugar in it at all.  It's similar to eating baker's chocolate because it is definitely a strong flavor but not sweet.<br /><br />Ingredient list, as best as I can translate:<br />licorice; sugar; starch; aromas [flavors]: powder of catechu [acacia], iris powder, natural mint aroma, mastic tree resin; lactose; dye: E153; coating agents: beeswax, carnauba wax, vegetable oil; vegetable fat; gelatin<br /><br />I give it four stars because it probably provides what it claims:  an inimitable taste, scents the breath, provides healthy and pleasant freshness  (translation), and it definitely tastes like licorice, but it is probably fair to say it is harsh rather than delicate.  I thought I'd throw it away at first.  Now I'm on my second container.  I've had it for about two years...
428	5	This coffee is very aromatic and full of flavor! When brewing the kitchen is filled with the aroma of warm vanilla! The coffee is very smooth and full flavored. I bought this for my husband because he doesn't tolerate the caffeine so this was a wonderful substitute! Love it!
429	5	I love Earl Grey tea, and if this company had any I would try it.  My friend is from England, and she introduced me to PG Tips.  The bags are shaped like little pyramids, and they steep very fast.  I take my tea with honey and a bit of milk, but this tea doesn't even need the milk - it is so delicious and mellow that there's no edge to take off it.<br /><br />Still, it has distinctive, definite tea flavor which is comforting and smooth.  There's no sharpness or bitterness, even if you forget and over-steep it.  You can make this tea as strong as you wish and it will still taste like delicious tea, and not like acidic, bitter tannin.  Great with honey, milk and shortbread!  It is, hands down, the best cup of tea I've ever enjoyed.
430	5	Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer,  the VUE   that uses different and patented cups.
431	5	I like the way it tastes. My neighbor used to sunbath in her backyard for hours at a time. I think she was drinking one of these one time, but maybe not. The shape of the bottle reminded me of a lint roller at first, and it still does. Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to be trapped in a lamp, like a genie. This soda is trapped in bottle, which is good, because it makes it easier to drink. My friend says he'd never drink this cola, but he did yesterday. He said it was awesome. Umm... Oh yeah! You DON'T have to keep the bottles after you drink all the cola out of it. You can throw it away. Or recycle it. Or buy another Fenitman's and put the cola from the new bottle into the old bottle. The possibilities are endless!!!
432	5	We enjoy a strong cup of coffee.  You can't get any better then this.  When they discontinued making the Kona Blend K-Cup, we switched to the Jet Fuel and weren't disappointed.
433	2	This sauce has a very spicy kick to it in heat and a little more tanginess than I prefer.  It isn't bad but am not sure it works that great with tacos.  I think it better as a dipping sauce for fried foods or veggies.  Even that is a bit of a stretch.  I wouldn't be a buyer.
434	5	Sugar free bites are a great way to satisfy the sweet desire in all of us...but without unnecessary and unhealthy sugars and fats. The 80-calorie packs are perfect to throw in the snack drawer at work. Now, if Murray would only put some of its other non-chocolate choices into these packs, it would be great! (Sigh...yes, I love chocolate, but I'm a migraineur and chocolate is only a rare treat for me since it is a key migraine headache trigger...)
435	3	This shake tasted decent if warmed up however I was hungry after 3-4 hours, other shakes I have tried lasted longer. Mixing with milk was better than water and definitely mix before heating up, it would not mix at all if you just add hot water. I didn't quite get the energy boost that other reviews provided, definitely more of a morning drink with breakfast not a breakfast replacement.
436	2	Got this stuff because the wife was interested in it.  BLUF, don't bother with it.  The directions say to use a few drops per xx ounces and I couldn't even taste it when I did that.  The second time I tried squeezing some into my glass it shot out at about a 45 degree angle all over my counter, narrowly missing my shirt sleeve.  FAIL!  After suiting up into a rubber protective suit and goggles, I managed to direct some of the liquid fun into my cup finally and it was a mediocre letdown.  I don't know what the people have been drinking that gave this stuff good reviews, but I rate it one step above pond water.
437	5	I usually drink the regular Bigelow Constant Comment for hot tea, but this Bigelow Oolong is the only one I'll drink for iced tea because it is absolutely the best.  It is also good hot.
438	1	These just taste like hot sweet apple juice. There is no cider component to the flavor at all. Rather than having a tart apple flavor with cider spices, the flavor is too sweet and rather flat.
439	5	I am a licorice junkie so buy it quite often. I did manage to send some to our troops only because I sent it out right away or I would have gobbled it up.
440	5	I needed these for my mothers wedding cake and was rather worried because she moved the date up on me but these were perfect. They're pretty much M&M's in rock form which is wonderfull. Delivery was super speedy which was a big plus with how little time I had to get my mom's wedding cake together!
441	1	The flavor is  O.K.   Won't buy again!  Very thin, and very tough!  Can get any generic brand with this texture!  Expected thick and soft from the description...NOT!  Not worth the price at all!  I eat a lot of jerkey for the low fat/high protein, but won't do this one again!  Disappointed!<br /><br />Jen
442	2	I thought dashi was a soup stock made from fish flakes and kombu. The top two ingredients in this product are Salt and then Monosodium Glutimate.
443	4	The description is for  Crackheads  candy, but this is  Crackheads 2  which has more caffeine. Crackheads have 200mg of caffeine, Crackheads 2 have 600mg.
444	5	We drink huge quantities of iced and hot tea.  This is an excellent buy from Amazon.  Great price and wonderful service - arrives every six months.  Earl Grey is my favorite tea!!
445	2	I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better.  I know taste preference is all subjective.  But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point.  After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it.  I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters.  I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low.
446	1	We got several colors of these suckers, for a rainbow birthday party, and the gold is not even remotely as pictured. My kids were even going through the colors and referred to these as brown. I'm sad that I won't have yellow in my lineup of suckers, but I guess I'll just throw yellow ribbons on them or something...<br /><br />They aren't the best tasting things, either, and they are actually just from Oriental Trading Co... So, I'm not super impressed; but the kids think they're cool.
447	5	Great results from such a simple product.  I would recommend these to anyone that has problems with moths in their pantry!
448	5	After my vet recommended switching from the basic Petsmart variety lo quality dry food, I tried Wellness canned cat food (even though the price was at least 3 times more expensive than the old Pro Plan).  My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.  My 4 cats get 1/2 can(of a 5.5 ounce can) each - a day, plus, I also give them 3 tablespoons of the Wellness dry food a day.  Try it for a month and you will be pleased with the results!
449	4	Finally! Pre-packaged healthy snack packs that I feel comfortable sending in my son's lunch bag.He probably enjoys them for the sweet taste of carrots and apples, but I like that it's ALL NATURAL. I keep them in my own purse for a quick snack on-the-go for myself or to throw in my younger son's snack trap. BEST PART: There is a blank circle on each individual pack where I can leave a sweet note or picture for my son. This is a perfect back to school purchase.
450	5	So far this is the best coconut oil I have ever purchased, is smells great I use it for after bath, sauteing, and makeing homemade breads. and best of all no GMO!
451	5	I send this gift every Christmas to my family in the Midwest. They love sampling the Southern products and have incorporated some of these items into their weekly meal plans. My Dad loves the hot sauce! You don't have to be a Southerner to love Glory Foods.
452	5	Make it with tomato paste and add garlic powder to the meat when browning it.  It is the BEST and everyone will love your spaghetti because they surely rave about mine.
453	5	I fell in love with this popcorn and then they stopped carrying it in the grocery stores!! So glad I found it on Amazon!  Its just not the same as sprinkling the pepper on...and the extra spice gives it a great flavor!! LOVE it!
454	5	These are delicious!! A nice way to get a serving of fruit along with a chocolate fix, but dark chocolate so you get antioxidants, too.  Also, in the small package so you don't over-eat :)
455	5	If you haven't heard of Sir Jason winters Tea it's time to get informed! Dieing from Cancer isn't the way he wanted to go and thanks to persistence and determination Jason Winters found the way to set his body free! In his book Killing Cancer, he tells the agonizing story of his return to life thanks to three simple herbs. Worth every penny! I drink it daily to purify my blood and stay healthy.
456	1	sometimes it feels like chewing on paper..flavor is not very good either...will not recommend it again..
457	5	As a retired breeder of Basset Hounds, I was supprised to see these  chew toys .  A lot is being said about brushing your dogs teeth, and here is a fairly pleasant solution. I have seven hounds living in and out with my wife, and myself. Hounds, od course, will pick up  almost anything   to chew on.  In the past, to keep our children presentable, we spent a good deal of money on dental descaling.  Some history... Dogs as a general rule use the front  Canines  to catch, rip and tear prey animals.  Once they have dinner, they chew with the premolars- the middle teeth, and only use the back molars for cracking marrow bones, and other long bones.  I haven't found a single marrow bone in any bag of dogfood.  The result is no molar chewing, and rapid plaque build up.  Now, dogs teeth do not decay like ours do.  The buildup is rather benign, unless it starts encroaching under the gums. Then, you have an infection.  Antibiotics will clear that problem, but what next?  Eventually, you have your dog aenesthatized for descaling, or extraction.  Basset molars are big and tough, and will not pull unless the root has rotted, and as they age,all dogs are more suseptable to trouble in  LA-LA  land.  I have never killed a coyote with plaque.  They eat bones.  Unfortunately, our bones tend to be cooked, and splinter, and can cause a perforated bowel.  Merrick has the answer.  They take the beef knuckle, clean but don't cook it, and our hounds chew them to their hearts content,even working the molars and all other teeth.  The result has been non-splintering marrow bones with the  goodies  stripped, so the bones are not greasy on rugs, and furniture. Yes, all seven live with us with a dog door to go out to their fenced yard.  The only issue we have found is Cleetis, our big, oldest male sneaks the favorites out at night and burys them, causing the younger kids no end of searching, and sniffing-outside. Not really negative.  For a while, I carved numgers in them for  inventory control , and had one come in that had been pre-numbers, and was brought in just before our first major snowstorm..  Okay, maybe I have too much free time, but these Merrick bones are the best.  I avoid all smoked, or flavored styles, and I cannot tell if they have a  new  smell, or not, but we have happy, healthy hounds, without semiannual dental descaling, of bad teeth.  Dare I even say they don't have bad breath?  Anyway, this is a shining recommendation of Merricks  General Panton  7-9inch beef knuckle.  Oh yeah, no stuffed ones either.  Sign me  Bassets of the Tundra  retired.
458	5	Really like the little single packages of jelly.  We end up throwing out the jars before we get them used up, so we're happy to be able to get these and I only found them on Amazon.com!<br />Mary Ann Hebert
459	5	After a bout of upset tum from a bad bag of food (lasted ~1 month!), my vet recommended vegetarian organic.  This fits the bill and, fortunately, my dog loves it!  Eventually, I want to get her back on a meaty diet...partly because this is expensive but also because it is just more natural for dogs to eat meat.  This is good because there's no yeast, no soy, no meat, and gets just basic ingredients that shouldn't upset a tummy.  We also add plain yogurt and OptaGest to her food in the evenings.  She's enjoying herself again.
460	5	This tea changed my life! I had been trying for several years to switch to green tea for its health benefits, after falling in love with the wonderful flavor of the green tea served up by my favorite Thai restaurant. However, none of the green teas in my local supermarkets had the smooth, consistent flavor that I craved. Then, on vacation in Florida three years ago, I happened to visit the China Pavilion at Epcot Center, and there I found an array of very authentic looking Chinese green teas with the Foojoy brand. After studying the descriptions of the various teas on display, I purchased several cartons of Foojoy China Green Tea, shipping all but one back home and keeping one carton to enjoy on vacation. To my delight, I discovered that this was the only green tea I had ever tried that could be made with boiling water and still taste deliciously smooth, with no trace of bitterness. I quickly made the transition to drinking this particular green tea almost exclusively. I have yet to find a local supplier, and so I have adopted the habit of purchasing through Amazon, buying several cartons at a time so as to reduce the impact of the shipping charges. Foojoy China Green Tea is very consistent in flavor, smooth and delightful. The only issue I have encountered is that sometimes a teabag becomes detached from its string, but that seems a very minor inconvenience considering how much I enjoy the tea.
461	1	I question the freshness of this honey.  I took it in an attempt to help my ibs and found that it was ineffectual.  Moreover, it just taste bad.
462	5	I'm an ex-pat from the UK.<br />This is the ONLY tea I buy for hot tea.<br /><br />You really have to try it to see for yourself!
463	1	My dog loves to chew on these, but dang, they give her the worst gas I've ever smelled in my life, and it goes on for hours. They probably don't cause the same reaction in all dogs, but I won't buy them anymore.
464	3	I am only reviewing the bacon flavor (was supposed to get 3 different flavors, but only got one).<br /><br />The good news is that my dog went crazy over this.  He absolutely loved it!  I have literally never seen him get this excited about a treat.  Unfortunately, that is also the bad news.  Because he loved it so much, and because he got so excited, it was a pointless exercise trying to get him to just lick the top.  He would take a lick or two, then he would start hopping and jumping, and trying to grab the entire bottle out of my hand.<br /><br />I have 11 and 10 year old daughters, and they normally love giving the dog a treat.  They won't give him this anymore, because it gets the dog hyper excited, and he starts jumping on them trying to get the treat out of their hands.<br /><br />So......whatever the ingredient inside the bottle is, my dog loves it, and I suppose yours will too.  The only question is the delivery system.  Maybe its not the best idea to have a treat that is meant to be held like this one is.  It assumes that your dog will sit quietly while you hold the bottle and he licks the top. No way that will ever happen with my dog.  He looks at it as he does any treat....he thinks it is meant to be taken and eaten.<br /><br />I debated on giving the product a 3 (because I don't think I will ever buy it for the reasons noted above) or a 4 (because my dog loves the flavor).  Ultimately I gave it a 4.  If my dog loves it, how could I give it a 3.<br /><br />**Update 10-5-11**Despite the fact that my dog loves the taste of this thing, I took it down to a 3 star rating.  Nothing really has changed, except for the fact that I am finding this to be more of a pain than I originally thought.  It was a novelty at first, but now I am weary of fighting the dog over this thing and trying to keep him from biting and chewing it (and creating a choking hazard or a mess).  Can't recommend it.<br /><br />**Update 10-9-11**I feel foolish writing another update on this product, but this is my last one.  My dog has gotten the hang of using this product, and now does a pretty good job of licking versusing chewing.  Also, this is one of his favorite treats. I am surprised, because my dog loves to chew, so I would have thought that a licking treat wouldn't hold much interest for him.  I am now thinking I would buy this product again ***but*** not at an $8 price point.  Way too expensive, relative to what you get.  The package says you get 500 licks.  In about 30 seconds, my dog get in 10-15 licks.  He does this twice a day, so this thing is not going to last 3 weeks at my house.  For me to buy this, it would have to be in the $2-3  price range.  I have to imagine that if they can sell deoderant in this price range (and this thing is identical to roller ball deoderant), then they can sell liquid dog treats in this price range.
465	3	Product was as advertised.  No surprizes.  My kids enjoyed this product but I found it way too sweet.<br />Good price<br />Quick shipping
466	5	This is one of the better decaf brews I have found for the Keurig.  I found others to be bland and leave somewhat of an aftertaste.  One I tried (San Francisco) had very poor packaging with cloth bottom so the coffee would go stale.<br /><br />I highly recommend this (I'll sure order it again).
467	5	I was a little skeptical after looking at the list of ingredients, but I decided to give this tea a try anyway.  I'm glad I did.  It's a delicious, sweet-tasting blend that's good both hot and iced.  I went through about a box a week; everyone I've served it to has enjoyed it.
468	1	This vendor sells this for  more than twice as much as a local market, and twice as much as Amazon does. Why pay 13.99 when it's 5.99 at a local market or Bed Bath and Beyond.
469	5	A premium holistic dog food.  My last two dogs lived to be 18-19 years of age.  Amazon makes it easy for us to locate a supplier of this food.
470	5	GREAT LITTLE DRINK,NICE FLAVOR. WILL PROBABLY ORDER MORE SOON . RECOMMENDED AS A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE TO SODA POP.
471	5	I have been looking for organic non-GMO corn to put up for storage. Trying to keep Monsanto out of my pantry is very hard. I read a review that said this product was non-GMO and I cannot find that on the packaging anywhere. I still am very happy with the purchase and the packaging of the this product. It didn't leak into the box like flours sometimes do. Will be eager to give it a try before I pack it away.<br /><br />Correction: I have been educated and found that this is in fact a non-GMO product and that just makes it all the better. I will be buying this product again, very soon.
472	5	I used to use milk in my coffee.  Then lactose intolerance kicked in big time. Coffee Mate to the rescue!  I prefer it to (lactose free) milk and any of the generic brands of nondairy creamers, all of which I have tried and no longer buy.  Use the liquid version of Coffee Mate if you like to chill your coffee down a tad.  I prefer the powder, it keeps the coffee hotter for a little longer.  I turned friends onto Coffee Mate when they used the generic versions of it.  They say and I agree that there is a huge taste difference between Coffee Mate and generic brands.  I also think it tastes better than Creamora
473	5	First of all, nobody told me this cereal was getting discontinued in the stores. Big mistake. I almost went Fruit Brute in my city chasing cars and stealing babies. I don't know who came up with the horrible horrible horrible idea to discontinue selling the physical embodiment of delicious. For the last few weeks I've been eating Cocoa Puffs trying to pretend like everything was okay. Well you know what? It wasn't okay. Eating Cocoa Puffs in place of Count Chocula is like dating a girl that looks sort of like the woman you love. You're only fooling yourself. Count Chocula is the best cereal ever. Period.
474	5	After the attractant is gone you can just fill with a little sugar water or apple juice and it works just as well.  We hang this up near our hummingbird feeders to keep the wasps from going after the hummers.
475	1	Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them.
476	1	I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea.
477	5	Buffalo Bills snacks ROCK in general, but after a friend ordered these Jalapeno/Cheddar Ole' Smokies and shared one with me, I realized I had to have some for my own.  Now I'm an addict, and why?  ...because these are just that good.  They have just enough smack of jalapeno-zip and a good squeal of cheese in them.  So good I had to write this review, finding it difficult because the tears of joy streaming down my face.  I think I'm suffering from my own kind of PTSD (Product Tested: Super Delicious!!!).  Truly a great, great flavor and consistency with these.
478	5	These are wonderful! The flavor of the frosting and filling is perfect, rich and sweet, but not too sweet. It's perfect for a light snack. I used to pull off the crust of poptarts because I hated the stale taste, but the crust on these is DELICIOUS. It tastes so moist and fresh, reminding me a little of what a real pastry tastes like. I don't get a stomach ache from these like I did after eating poptarts... and these are organic! I am definitely buying these from now on!<br /><br />If you are wondering about the ingredients, they are:<br /><br />Organic wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice invert, organic palm oil, organic evaporated cane juice, organic brown sugar, organic whole wheat flour, organic corn starch, organic vital wheat gluten, organic dextrose, organic molasses, organic rice starch, sea salt, leavening (baking soda, cream of tartar), natural brown sugar flavor, organic maple flavor, organic cinnamon, organic honey, organic rice bran extract, organic cocoa, organic caramel flavor, organic vanilla flavor, organic caramel color, algin sodium citrate, monocalcium phosphate, whey protein isolate (milk).<br /><br />The Frosted Strawberry ones are really good, too.
479	2	This coffee smells incredible, but the taste doesn't deliver.  There is an odd after taste that is really disappointing.  I'll try a different flavor next time.
480	5	I am embarking on changing my diet for the better,  since diabetes runs rampant in my family. Walden Farms is a major help. I have read some of the reviews of this product and am skeptical. Assuming all of us has had regular ketchup since birth, anything outside of that realm will taste different especially when there is no calories, carbs, or sugars. This product is a excellent substitute, I put this on my tofu scramble or potatoes. It has a consistency of thick hot sauce, and it is runnier than regular ketchup. Before this, I was using reduced sugar heinz ketchup and I hated that when I first got that brand but I eventually got used to it. I suggest you at least use half the bottle before you decide you don't like it or won't incorporate it into your lifestyle. Highly recommended product! Can't wait to try the mayo!
481	5	I'm extremely glad I ordered these mushrooms.  The price per ounce, especially rehydrated, ends up being quite reasonable.  I usually rehydrate with warm water (and make sure I use the water in the recipe for extra flavor) then add the morels to sautees, soups, and stir-frys.  Really excellent product.
482	4	This is what I wanted: Solo brand almond paste. In conjunction with other purchases, it shipped for free, and it was cheaper than anything I can get locally (Florida panhandle). What I found odd is that the cans arrived loosely rolling in a box with some bubble wrap. I had wondered about the four-can  case,  but hadn't wanted to look a gift horse in the mouth. I am still happy with my gift horse (it's almond paste: it's nearly always sweetened and flavored; if you want it plain, make your own, but it won't be as smooth), but it was a little odd.
483	5	this is by far the best coffee i have tried yet for my keurig and also one of the better prices.  thank you
484	2	Can't say as I'm pleased. The bag came with the biggest ear I have ever seen. With two dogs that are under 30lbs, I had to cut it into pieces. They still didn't seem to like it. But I like their other products.
485	5	If you are a person that eats a  clean  healthy food but you just a craving a healthy salty snack, this find from MOM's (My Organic Market)fits the bill. My husband loves them too!  Crunchy tasty,and the single serving bags by the case are always on top of the fridge to grab on the run!
486	4	I'm having a cup of this coffee as I am writing this review. It was the deal most of all that made me buy this Tully's blend. I think Tully does make some of the best kcups I have had though. Love the Kona blend but now is quite expensive. This has a nice flavor to me but could be a bit stronger. That being said, if I get another deal on this blend, I will definately by it again.
487	5	I have shoulder length medium to thin hair. Weighing it down with heavy conditioners that cause it to look even thinner is unacceptable.  Additionally, within the last year I noticed that a couple of areas on my scalp were itchy. So, I was curious to see if this product would soothe the itch and condition without making my hair droop.<br /><br />Well, I am impressed. I've been using the conditioner for a few weeks and love the way my hair looks and the itchiness is greatly improved. I use about a quarter-sized dollop and focus on the ends of my hair with the majority but then run my palms over my scalp and wait a minute then rinse. The fragrance is mild and the price very reasonable. I will update my review if I encounter any problems.
488	5	Vegan and delic!  Only 150 calories.  I have them on automatic shipment.  Great for a healthy but choc snack.  Plus omega fats.  Win win
489	5	I must have a little yc dark sugarfree chocolate everyday. This is a fantastic product for people like me who cannot eat refined sugars.<br />The maltitol in the yc dark chocolate is the best sweetener because it assimalates into the bloodstream very slowly and as a result I feel great.<br />Keep up the good work you do in making such a wonderful product that serves many of us so well. Thank you doesn't begin to cover it! I am a huge fan<br />and greatly appreciate all your hard work.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda Miller
490	5	Some of the Keurig coffees seem to have a slightly bitter aftertaste. This one does not. It's got good flavor and seems strong enough you can brew the large size cup without it getting watered down.
491	1	People must be fool to buy this when you can get the same thing at the asian market, chinese food stores or indian stores for only one dollar, are they seller the jar or the tamarin. be careful.
492	5	I have this item to ship monthly.  I think this is the best honey that I have found.  I tried almost all local honeys, I wanted uncook & unfiltered honey for the best health benefit. I found this is by far the best flavor and consistency.  My honey arrives on time and in good condition.
493	3	Back when I used the breeze cat system, there were 4 cats in the apartment (2 are my cats, and the other 2 were my brother's cats that I was temporarily taking care for him).  I had the breeze next to the original litter box for 3 days and none of the cats used it.  They all went on top of the pellets to check it out but did not pee/poop in there.  One of the cats tried to eat a pellet and I took it away from him.  I *think* none of them actually ate it.<br /><br />On the 4th day, I took the original litter box away, and then they all started using the breeze.  There were no  accidents  in the apartment and I did not find pee or poop on the floor or carpet.  I think the fact that I placed some of the pellets with their original litter really helped them get accustomed to the product (and also since the breeze system was sitting there for 3 days, they were at least familiarized with it).<br /><br />The pad that sucked up the pee worked really well.  I experimented to figure out the right time to change the pad for the 4 cats.  It turned out to be every 3 days.  As for hard poop, I was ok with it staying at the top of the system and would pick it up with a plastic bag and throw it out (very easy).<br /><br />The problem is with the runny/watery poop which will go all over the pellets and is tougher and takes longer to clean.  A lot of the pellets ended up getting thrown out once the watery poop touched them.  Also, this system does not do anything to help minimize the poop smell, which is the main complaint for my boyfriend regarding this system.  In the end, we did not keep the breeze because the smell was too horrible.  Even if you clean it up immediately after the cat pooped, the smell was still there.<br /><br />We went back to the original litter box.  I am going to keep my eye on this product to see if tidy cats come out with better pellets that will do something about poop smell.  If that time ever comes, I would buy it because I know my cats will use this system & it did wonders for the pee... now if only the poop situation works out!
494	2	I am a Popchips fanatic!  I thought I would try something different.  Big mistake.  The only thing good about these is the crunch.  The taste is not there. I will not buy them again.  I will stick to Popchips.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVFDOO >Popchips 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>
495	5	had seen these for a while; took the plunge after reading multiple reviews and checking what was available locally for what price; this surpasses all I could find locally; great price; great product!
496	1	Zero is not an option so I had to rate this 1 star. Inquiry emails were ignored. The order was never processed. Quite a disappointment!
497	3	It's about time that coffee takes the road of tea and become more user friendly. The battle between pods/bags/filters has been firmly for filters in the past few years. Can this product sway the battle?<br /><br />Sadly, it only produces a mediocre cup of coffee. The 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, produced under free trade and in an organic environment, should have a bold robust flavor. Maybe it is the bags themselves or the beans but the flavor was thin enough to be overpowered by minimal amounts of sugar or milk.<br /><br />That being said, on the road, it's not a bad cup of joe. 4 stars for portability and ease of use.
498	5	Lathers up nicely. Rinses out easily. Cleans my hair, but doesn't strip it, so it's not as dry as with some other shampoos. Not overly scented, but I wouldn't mind an unscented version, and I could do without the red dye. My hair is 24  long. If I don't brush it several times, it's a tangled mess by the end of the day. I find that, combined with the conditioner, I don't have to brush it as often as I usually do. In addition, my hair is incredibly soft. I love the bottle! It has a very ergonomic design and is easy and comfortable to hold, and I love the flip cap! Press to open. Press to close. So easy!<br /><br />7/3/2012: I just received the Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner. Amazon has addressed the problem of leakage by putting a piece of clear tape over the lid. It worked, and the tape came off with no sticky residue left behind. Thanks, Amazon!
499	5	My Dogs love this food..This food is so much cheaper than Chain Food Stores.I know because I work<br />at one.
500	5	I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.  I take it at night and it improves my otherwise slow system by the morning.  I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall  uggh  feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.  We take one dose every night.  I highly recommend!  Your local health food store might give you a sample ... try it for a few days but don't buy it from there ... come to Amazon because it's WAY cheaper :)  Good luck!
501	5	Oh man, we've been searching for a treat that would take our chowhound cocker more than seconds to consume.  These treats take him a couple minutes to eat and he sits patiently for me to give him one.  They are great, all natural, and make me feel better than when I give them treats with filler crap in them.<br />Who knew sweet potatoes could be a dog's favorite treat?
502	3	I'm not a big margarita fan, but I really liked this drink.  I spritzed it with a splash of diet lemon lime soda (7up, sierra mist, or whatever you would like) and ice... maybe all the negative reviews are because it should be spritzed a bit with something...  I mean after all if the calories are reduced it's because it won't taste  quite that close to the real deal .  If it is doctored up it's pretty good though! :)
503	5	If you have not tried popchips, what are you waiting for?  They are the best.  Not baked or fried but low cal, lowfat and HIGH TASTE.  I have tried everything on the market and these are by far the best product out there of it's kind.  Guilt free snacks that are delicious are hard to come by.  This company has it down!  Every flavor rocks and new ones are coming soon!
504	2	I guess everyone has to do their own trial and error to see what works for their little fur friends. After researching alot about the best thing for dogs to eat, Wellness is one of the brands that has my respect... but...<br />it makes our little BOM (beagle/pomeranian) & our rough coated jack russell mix<br /> THIRSTY, FARTY & WEEPY. (that sounds like a bad mix of creepy dwarf names)<br /><br />To be fair, THEY LIKE IT... This small breed kibble is happily gobbled,then they insist on drinking aLOT! and then they fart a little bit, too....and it makes my terrier's eyes weepy, too... with those icky rust stains, and she NEVER has had that problem.<br /><br />So, we are back to our other favorites, which is the rabbit kibble from Nature's Variety Instinct, and the frozen PawNaturaw beef medallions, and of course, their fav breakfast is<br />a Stella and Chewy's Dandy Lamb dehydrated steak. (those don't make the girls thirsty!)<br />These choices are a little closer to the raw diet which I prefer to feed when I can.<br /><br />So, sorry, Wellness, we tried ya! We will finish the bag, but won't be buying any more...<br />I figure we got about a week of dog farts to suffer through yet.
505	4	Likety Stik is a great product for some dogs obviously, but Foxy, my ten-year-old standard poodle, is not interested. She first thought she was to take the entire container into her mouth. When I didn't give her the opportunity to try to swallow the whole thing, she tasted the juice on the ball. Deciding it was pretty good, she looked around to see if any other dogs might just have happened to come by for a visit. She is a picky eater. When she reacts by looking to see if any other dogs are around, it is evident that something is extra tasty. If she really, really likes something super tasty, she doesn't take the time to look around for other dogs. She has licked it a few times, but she seems somewhat reluctant. The low-calorie idea is neat, but my picky eater needs all the calories she can get.<br /><br />From a people's perspective it seems a good product, but no matter how much I shake it, I find it necessary to turn the ball manually to make the juice available. It would be fun to try this stick on a dog with more enthusiasm about food.<br /><br />Four stars.
506	4	This is really a baking mix, and it's not a bad one by any stretch. I'd rather use sorghum, tapioca or corn starch for making sauces or thickening soups, though. What's really nice about Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose GF Flour is that it allows for easy substitution in your Betty Crocker cookbook. I wouldn't recommend it for making yeast breads, though I prefer it for quick breads - muffins, cornbread, and the like.<br /><br />As with any gluten-free flour, you have to make some adjustments, both in terms of the recipe and in terms of your expectations of taste and consistency. Without gluten, baked goods won't hold together as well, so you need a binding agent. Xantham gum is best with this flour, but guar gum will also work.<br /><br />Taste ... you really need a strong flavor in the recipe to cover up the aftertaste. Dark chocolate? You won't notice the bean or tapioca flour aftertaste. Fruits? No problem - I've made delicious blueberry muffins and dark chocolate-cranberry muffins. Sweet taste? Aforementioned cornbread was delicious - especially if you make it with buttermilk. Snickerdoodles? I'd start with sorghum honestly.<br /><br />Consistency - this is a dense, heavy flour. Sifting is essential. If you don't sift, your recipes will turn out still, but they'll be thick and heavy. You'll also need to add extra liquid (milk or oil or egg substitute) to help the dough hold together, rise and gain volume. This rules out yeast doughs for me - I think you can successfully make a bread but I prefer a millet-sorghum-tapioca-potato starch loaf (I also like the slightly spicy flavor of millet).<br /><br />All in all, this should be a pantry staple for the gluten-free household, though keep supplemental flours to experiment with.
507	5	A long time addict to potato chips, I decided to try these when I began a healthy diet.  My successful weight loss program has been high protein, moderately low carbs, low sodium, low fat, and plenty of water.<br /><br />This snack is PERFECT.  Gives me the crunch I crave for snacks, while keeping my protein high, and the  zip  of the Wasabi makes me crave water.  Like others have said, the experience of the Wasabi power fluctuates.  Just when you think,  well, these are not very hot , you grab a bean or two that sets your mouth on fire, clears your sinus canals and makes you stare into the bag in trepidation.  :)<br /><br />Because of the high protein, it keeps me from feeling hungry for a long time after I munch a bit.  Unlike some other reviewers, I do not feel they need to be more salty.  They're just right!
508	5	I am NOT a coffee drinker, (cant stand the taste) nor do i like tea in the little bags that you have to steep...but i LOVE my Oregon Chai (original is my persnal favorite) to get me going in the morning!! i go through an average of 2 boxes a week.  if you have never had it, its sort of reminds me of a spiced hot cocoa? NO coffee taste, nothing like a capacchino flavor, not a watery flavor like tea bags....just Delicious!! nothng like it!! i LOVE it!! If you have never had it, try it, you will not be disappointed! (and on the odd chance you dont lke it, send it to me! i wont let it go to waste!!  lol)
509	5	I have never cared for flavored teas.  I'm not sure what made me try this, but I am so glad I did!  It is positively addicting! The aroma is wonderful and it tastes even better than it smells. I have signed up with Amazon's auto-shipment to insure that I will never run out.  Simply delicious!
510	5	I tend to get too hyped up on coffee, and most teas have a flavor of which I tire after a few consecutive days. Tazo's Om is a very unique tea which I immediately liked, and now drink every single morning. I find the taste to be very pleasant; not too fruity and not too bitter. The black tea definitely adds a tiny caffeine kick, but not much more than a regular green tea, and green remains the dominant flavor. As with all green teas, over-steeping can lead to bitterness, so limit to about 3 minutes. Since I drink this daily, the fact that Om is organic is a big plus.
511	5	i tried this coffee when it was $ll for 24 k cups delicious. so i bought two more boxes and didn't sign up for monthly delivery, now i can't find where to sign up. and the price jumped to $28.99 for 24 cups. that's $1.20 per cup too pricey for this or any other kcup.
512	3	Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that  Turkey & Chicken Formula  actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as  contaminated .  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.
513	5	The Greenies ordered through Amazon is less expensive than the  bricks & mortar  stores; and I plan to order another box.  We received the product a few days after placing the order.<br /><br />Terrific product, and our lab loves this treat!
514	4	I was searching for the honey filled candy that I remember having as a child and came across this product. They are good and I like them, but they are not quite the same as what I what I remember and my search continues. The initial taste is a little perfumy and has only a subtle honey flavor. The inside of each candy has only a small bit of honey, not the flow I was hoping for and it lacks the soft chewy center the old candy had. It would be fantastic on it's own if I wasn't comparing it to another product.
515	5	B&M Brown Bread (in cans)- with or without raisins...I sent for these cans because I'd eaten this brown bread many, many times years ago.  We had it at home every time we had baked beans for dinner.  They just go together.  I had kind of forgotten about the bread until my sisters and I began reminiscing recently about our favorite childhood meals. We all remembered how much we liked the brown bread and hadn't bought any in awhile. Then we went shopping for this brown bread and nobody carried it in the stores around here. How disappointing! A whole new generation will never know about this bread or how good it is...and how well it goes with baked beans.  I ordered several cans and shared them with family.  I will have to order more pretty soon. It still tastes as good as I remembered.  They almost need to reintroduce it to the public...the younger generations don't know anything about it. I hope they keep making it and I sure wish they still had it in our local grocery stores. (Portland, OR)
516	5	I started purchasing these for my daughter when she was about 9 months old.  We started with the Happy Baby pouches and she has been a fan ever since.  I'm a fan because these pouches allow her to self-feed without a lot of mess.  This is especially great when in the car.  I love the combos of the pouches too.  I even tried a few of them myself and they don't taste too bad!  Since my daughter's gotten older, I have started to be a little adventurous and add these pouches to things like pancakes and oatmeal in the morning!  She's getting an intake of fruits and veggies without even knowing!
517	5	If you have a dog with missing teeth or a senior dog who has trouble chewing, this is the treat to get them.  Your fully toothed dogs will like them, too.
518	3	it is great product for my daughter who allergic to soy, milk, white egg, wheat.<br />but a little pricy..<br />and some package  have some thing that we could not chew.. and don t know what is it..<br />be careful for choking..
519	5	Tastes just wonderful with out all the sodium.It makes wonderful smoked salmon, just add liquid smoke!
520	5	After tiring of making my dog's food from scratch I looked for an all natural product.  Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food; no  powdered protein  or other questionable substances.  My dog loves it but to be honest I have to tell you that she practically inhales anything that she thinks might be food. I have the reassurance that this product won't hurt her.  The turkey and brown rice from Newman's Own is also excellent.
521	5	I'm so glad I found this mix.  Each recipe I try I have loved.  I can't get enough of the scones.  I get compliments on them all the time!
522	5	I had not read the reviews and was quite surprised when I opened the package. There are K-Cups! I was about to return them, when I read the reviews, so I just popped one in, and WOW! nice and strong coffee, with less packaging!<br /><br />Will definitely try all the flavors from this great company!
523	4	I have purchased this brand of coffee in bean form in the past, and was glad to see it available for my Keurig coffee maker.  It has a smooth, mild flavor and tastes every bit as good as the beans.  It's not a knock-your-socks-off flavor, but it's far above average.
524	5	Parsley is one of the best sources of flavonoids on the planet. It is loaded with apigenin in the form of apin, and it is very difficult to get this much apigenin from any other source. It is roughly 10:1 gram for gram, so that parsley is pouring flavonoids. This ample supply makes it practical to add parsley using a large serving spoon or measuring cup. I recommend up to one cup of parsley daily, which necessitates a large supply, such as provided by this product.<br /><br />I will admit that I am not an expert regarding parsley as spice, but I love the fresh green parsley flavor that is imparted by this product. It brightens and freshens every food that I have added it to, which is many. When I get a little more money, I will get more so that I can have some in storage. I am sure that it stores well, in a cool dark place.<br /><br />I may write a parsley guide, so that I can provide recipes to use this much parsley. Apin and apigenin are not absorbed very well by the body, so it probably helpful to use parsley with yogurt, cheese, and acid/oil emulsions in order to improve the absorption. Fatty fish, such as red salmon, is a often neglected source of healthful oils. Citrus and vinegar work equally well for the acid. Be sure and add plenty of fresh ground pepper as well, which is very flavorful, but also likely to aid absorption. Until the time that I am able to write a guide, you can check my blog, which is linked from my profile page.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus
525	5	Gosling's makes the rum, and Gosling's also makes a ginger beer.  Lot of people make ginger beer.  But if you want the perfect Dark & Stormy (or you just like ginger beer) this is the ginger beer to end all ginger beer arguments.  It's delicious.  I was a little nervous ordering 24 bottles of ginger beer through Amazon, but I couldn't find this brand anywhere and Amazon delivered as usual.
526	1	Arrived on schedule.  I order decaffinated and they sent caffinated. Good tea either way.
527	5	I'm from Maine and I have to tell you that I would never buy grade A maple syrup. If I'm going to use maple syrup, I want that rich, distinctive taste, not something that's barely different than white sugar. That's actually a good comparison - grade A is to grade B as white is to brown sugar. I know we're all used to thinking of  grade A  as meaning of superior quality, but that's not how it works with this. It is referring to the level of filtering/processing the sap goes through. If you want generic sweetness, go grade A. For everything else, grade B. This is a trusted brand of organic syrup with a great flavor. By the way, for baking and real maple syrup afficionados, there is also a grade C (even darker)!
528	4	Slim Jims are great, although we had a wrapper sealed with no slim jim inside, then later discovered the missing one packaged halfway with another, though it was not sealed, so neither were eatable. X.x
529	3	My entire family sampled these gingersnaps and offered opinions.  All of my children thought they were too spicy and had a bad aftertaste.  My husband, the one who really appreciates gingersnaps in our family, said that they were a bit spicy, but he liked the overall taste.  He also thought they were a little hard.<br /><br />I must say, I agree with the children on this one.  The cookies have a very strong spice taste- almost overwhelming.  My mouth burned when I ate them.  They are very hard- even harder than is typical for a gingersnap.  I like organic products and was really hoping to like these, but I was disappointed.
530	4	Keurig is amazing and Green Mountain coffee is just as amazing.<br />This is coffee that will open your eyes in the morning, as well<br />as provide a welcome break during the day.<br />Its not bitter, its smoooooooooooth and mellow.<br />No aftertaste.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!
531	5	I've always been a fan of Pure bars for their quality ingredients so was super excited to see this newest offering from them.<br />First off, this is a STICKY bar which makes it not hard, but actually very difficult to remove from the wrapper..no way you're sliding this thing up in the wrapper, think peeling/tearing the wrapper off instead. No exaggeration on the stickiness here, it's tough!<br />BUT, it is SO, SO, SO worth it! It reminds me of a conventional trail mix bar I bought back in the day, only with high quality ingredients and standards that I demand now days. Quality you can see and taste, a true winner and a unique offering in the natural/organics bar mix.<br />Definitely a new favorite and will become a staple around our house. Both my children, 5 & 2.5yrs old agree, it's worth the sticky fingers! :)
532	5	Although messy, this product gave me fantastic results for my Christmas cookies. It dries pretty quick although the spray smells overpowering when wet. Once the spray was dry on my cookies, I could taste no difference. Make sure you have your work area properly covered, because I held the cookies in my hand inside the sink to spray them. My hand sure did look pretty when I was done!
533	1	Just got my order in today. I unpacked it and went to put them in my cupboard, and I discovered 8 dented cans. 8 out of 12! 5 of them were severely dented. The Amazon packaging was fine and it was in a larger box with other items which were not damaged, so it was packaged like that at the manufacturer. I was hoping the bad reviews from last year were fixed but I guess not. These cans were from Thailand (not Sri Lanka) so atleast they fixed that issue. I'm most likely going to find a different brand after this!<br /><br />Amazon of course is amazing and they already have a replacement shipment on the way. Hopefully they checked it before it left and I don't get anymore dented cans!
534	5	These coco nibs have a very satisfying chocolate taste without added fat and sugar. I add 1/4 cup to my double fudge brownies for an extra touch. They are also good in cookies or Muesli. If eaten straight from the bag, the texture is similar to crushed coffee beans.<br />The taste is a mix of chocolate and coffee.
535	3	This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this  Kona coffee  is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.
536	5	This review is for Higgins & Burke Earl Grey Black Tea, 20-Count (Pack of 6). A fresh, pleasing aroma is the first thing you'll notice about this tea. But it's the wonderful flavor that will keep you coming back for more. Earl Grey Tea is one of my favorite teas, and this one is perfect.
537	5	These are awesome. And good for you to boot. Sure there's probably a little too much salt, but everything in moderation, right...
538	5	The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.
539	3	I love the cola flavored gummies. LOVE it! but these are a little too hard/stiff for me. VERY chewy, almost a stale type of chewy. wish it was more like the soft gummies that you can get from the grocery stores. but the flavor is good though.  price is great for 5 pounds but it's only getting 3 stars. it would have gotten 5 stars if it was softer.
540	5	I love Eight Oclock coffee & am always looking for a good deal on it. This was a great deal, very reasonable price. We are so enjoy the taste every morning.
541	1	I used this in one of my favorite recipes last week with disasterous results. It completely over powered all other ingedients and flavor elements in the dish and left my kitchen with the string, unmistakable aroma of vinegar. I could barely finish a small serving and sent the left-overs straight to the garbage disposal. Yuck.<br /><br />I gave it to my mohter who frequently drinks vinegar for medicinal purposes. For direct ingestion, she thought it was much more palatable than other vinegars she has tried.<br /><br />Rather a tale of two cities on this one. I guess one's opinoin of this product simply comes down to the capacity in which one plans to use it. It appears that this is good to drink. I will, however, never cook with it again.
542	5	These microwave pork rinds are absolutely the BEST available. Any bag of pork rinds you buy in a store are not as good. The only place I've seen their equal is the ones that are cooked fresh at fall festivals and such places. They are EXCELLENT. Do not overcook them or they will burn and be lousy. If done properly, they are the best.
543	5	I like Licorice...but Lucky Country Aussiie Style Licorice I love. It comes in different fruit flavors. Doesnt have that platic taste like the flavored twizzlers do.<br />In fact these are a bit different than regular licorice. Theyre better. They come thicker and pretty solid they are not hollow. The texture is a cross betwen a regular licorice and a fruit snack. I love these things.
544	5	I bought this two bag order for under $14 and got free shipping.  The current seller has $9 tacked on to the price.  Wait for Amazon to put it back on, and get the real deal.  Fronter makes a really great line of products.
545	4	You may be wondering what is disappointing about a four star coffee.... This is a better than average brew, reasonably strong while not bitter (so no robusto beans), but the flavour, if  intense,  it is not particularly rich. If you love Timothy's Rainforest Espresso & Parisian Nights, this coffee is not in the same league. It is similar to Green Mountain's bold roasts.
546	1	This green tea is the worst I have purchased. I don't understand the good reviews. This has a smoke taste. It is not smooth or light at all. Lipton original green tea tastes better than this. This does not taste organic. At first I thought it was Lipton in a different package, but that would be insulting Lipton. Don't waste your money on this product, I have 5 boxes that will be tossed out.<br /><br />Best Green teas I have had:<br />1. Bigelow Organic<br />2. Celestial Seasonings Organic<br />3. Lipton Organic
547	4	I've bought this coffee for years, but I noticed it is not being stocked in my local grocery. I'm afraid it is being discontinued.
548	5	Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes are excellent! Usually, one chooses between diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste--but these are fire roasted tomatoes. Muir Glen used to make fire roasted tomatoes in adobo sauce, luckily there's <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T8XGW >La Costena Chipotle Adobo Sauce, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> For adobo clarification, it's the Latin American kind, not the Filipino vinegar-based kind.<br /><br />These tomatoes are delicious in the Mexican breakfast eggs in <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140132360X >Jamie's America: Easy Twists on Great American Classics, and More</a>, the chocolate/coffee chili at the website for <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AFQRG >VegNews</a> They are quite versatile. Deborah Madison, who once helmed <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767908236 >The Greens Cookbook: Extraordinary Vegetarian Cuisine from the Celebrated Restaurant</a>, the vegetarian establishment run by the San Francisco Zen Center, recommends these.<br /><br />Muir Glen tomatoes are worth what they put in the itty bitty can! Fire roasted and fiery! They taste good... and are good for you.
549	2	Not worth the price!!! Has a very bitter taste!!!!! You have to add a ton of honey to it to make it worth a damn. Does not help coat the throat in anyway!!!!!!
550	5	My baby is 9 months old and loves this! I started her on this when she was 3 months old. I swichted once to Enfamil and Similac but noticed she threw up all the time with those formula. I swithced her back and no more spit ups/threw ups. Love the 4 pack it comes in because you never know when you are going to run out of it.
551	4	I like the busy bones.  My pit has to work at it a bit harder than she does some of other  large  bones on the market.  I do wish it would last a little longer.  She can finish one in under 5 minutes.  I'm giving it to her because I want her to be BUSY.  Not distracted for 5 minutes.
552	5	I've tried both the Numi  Chocolate Puerh  and  Magnolia Puerh  teas.  Both are excellent quality.  The flavors are distinct, not overpowering, and enjoyable.<br /><br />These teas are enjoyable with just a touch of agave to sweeten the cup.  The flavor is pleasant without any need to be enhanced or covered up by anything else.  A touch of lemon juice also works well.  And a dash of vitamin C can be used in harmony with this tea.<br /><br />I do agree with the instructions to not let it steep too long, in fact a good full flavor is obtained at the low end of their recommended steeping times.<br /><br />I like what they have written on the box about being high quality and healthy.  It is nice to not find  artificial flavors  added.  This company appears to really care about producing a good product and protecting the environment.
553	5	After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.  I've tried several flavors, and they like them all.  They are excited again at meal time.  The best benefit is that the  tummy problems  are so much better.
554	5	Simply the best mincemeat you can buy today.  I add a chopped up apple and a little butter and brown sugar and heat til mixture bubbles - and then put in crust.  Makes the best pie since my Mom's 50 years ago.  Restores reputation of  mincemeat pie !
555	5	I wasn't sure I'd use 6 cans of these but now after a couple of months, I'm already down to 2! I mix these w/my baby's stage 2 baby foods to thicken the texture up. It's worked really great and my baby has taken to these really well.
556	5	Closest to regular Oreos among the organic ones....we cannot eat regular ones any more...we have grown to love these.
557	5	A refreshing cold beverage and a soothing, perfect, hot cup of tea. Offers healthful benefits.
558	5	My 2 fat cats can not get enough of this canned food. They eat it like it is going out of style.
559	5	The Purrfectly Fish and Chicken food line is great - I have a very finicky cat who has to eat because of health problems, so letting him go until he's hungry enough doesn't work. On top of that, he has a real preference for dry kibble, which he can't have anymore. But the  Purrfectly  line he scarfs down, trying to purr and eat at the same time, and actually begs for more! Whiskas, I'm a customer again!!! Thanks!!!
560	5	I love hot seasonings.  I grow my own habanero peppers and this is great.  I sprinkle them on handcut fries and even on my steak and chicken.  Love this stuff.  Gotta get some more.
561	5	We have a Vizsla and struggled to find a food that #1 she liked and #2 that didn't give her the runs (sorry - gross, I know).  This was the first food that met both requirements.  Given that her breed is prone to hip problems, the extra glucosamine helps to keep her joints healthy.  The food is pricy, the packaging isn't flashy and the name may not be well known - but this food is working for us.
562	5	We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!
563	4	I feel bad for the previous reviewer - maybe it was an error on La Choy's part? Each box we've ever purchased come with each cookie individually wrapped. There are cheaper ones out there but I prefer La Choy because they'll stay fresher longer due to the individual wrappings.
564	4	After shopping several places for more economical raw cashews than my local health food market, I decided on this item. They arrived quickly and are great nuts, however, my only complaint would be how they were packaged. Five pounds of cashews should be shipped in a proper box -- NOT a priority mail envelope!! I received my package punctured with a big hole, and there was a hole in the bags inside holding the cashews. Not sure how many cashews I lost in the delivery process, but doesn't look to have been too many. PLEASE Bayside Candy: package them better and I'll be a repeat customer and a 5-star rating!<br /><br />Other than the shipping snafu, the quality of these cashews are very good and are working very nicely in my raw food recipes.
565	5	Brach's Butterscotch Hard Candy is the Very Best Butterscotch. People have bought me other kinds when they couldn't find the Brach's brand- there is no comparison; Brach's is definitely the Best. I'm having a hard time finding the Brach's Butterscotch hard candy in Central Michigan. Many stores are carrying their store brand of butterscotch which I won't buy. You only have one life and mine is going to have Brach's Butterscotch Hard Candy in it even if I have to go on-line to find it. I Love to put two pieces in my mouth at once  and bounce them back and forth in my mouth- what a flavor rush!
566	1	I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earth's best.
567	4	My only reservation is that I had no choice on the specific type of basil plants I receive.  Some of the ones in the kit are not ones I am interested in.
568	5	This tastes really good on my yogurt.  It is so hard to find gluten free granola but I love the Kind brand.
569	4	I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!
570	5	I bought them to flavor up my water (it was on sale) as an alternative to Chrystal Light.. However I'm totally digging the added vitamins with each flavor. I'm having major hair loss problem these days (due to stress, malnutrition, and diet I guess. Or simply, I've aged and can't act like I'm in teens). However after I started taking 'em my hair loss is decreasing (I don't see tons of hair piling up each morning when I comb it). So I'd say it definitely works.<br /><br />Not the best testing thing around comparing to other flavor powders, but not worse either. I love the vitamins in it (I'm reluctant to take the pill-like supplement) ..
571	5	These strawberry gummies have just the right flavor and are a great chew.<br />This 5 pound bag goes a long way and is full of flavor.<br />If you are into baking, they make a nice decoration for the top of cupcakes or a cake.<br />These candies are eye pleasers complete with strawberry looking green tops and raised places on the strawberry denoting seeds.  Kids will love them because they are cute as well as tasty.
572	5	My cat isn't very picky but seemed to be having a reaction of some kind to store bought cat food - I feel bad that I was ever feeding him this low quality grocery store food.<br /><br />I looked up on the Internet and found that two of the most recommended cat foods were Wellness Core and Blue Buffalo.  I bought both and my cat much prefers the Blue Buffalo Wilderness as far as dry food goes.  He also eats wet food and he likes the Wellness Healthy Indulgence packets.<br /><br />Anyway, the food change seems to have done the trick.  No more itchy eyes for kitty and he looks great!
573	4	I made this in a regular coffee maker made for pods.<br />I thought it was find - it reminded me most of a breakfast blend.  It was very smooth with what seemed like a normal dose of caffeine.  It's not at all bitter - unfortunately, around here, we LIKE bitter in our beer and coffee, so I probably would not buy it again.  If, however, you like something like Maxwell House Breakfast Blend with a mild flavor, but a bit more caffeine, you'll probably really like it.<br />I love that it is fair trade.  I had to use scissors to open the packets.
574	2	I have had these crackers before and they were great.  The 12 boxes I purchased recently were overcooked and half of them were broken.  I was very disappointed.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026443GA >Elki Savory Crackers Spring Onion, 5.3ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>
575	5	I am THE original drinker of click and what I mean by that is I am a personal friend of Greg Smith (owner) and have been drinking click since he invented it and gave it to me at the gym in a mason jar probably 3 years ago!! This has been a great healthy alternative for a person who was a regular customer at Starbucks every morning, and better yet it is cheaper!!  I crave click every morning over any coffee!!  After my early morning workout it gives me my vitamins, minerals and most important the espresso boost I need to jump start my day. My preferance is to drink it cold, it mixes well in water and if you want some extra protein just add milk, an egg, or my personal favorite is a scoop of muscle milk protein.
576	2	This doesn't really work for me. I went to the doctor and got some real prescription deodorant. Ask your doctor for some! It's cheap, but you need a doctors note. The limit the amount of the solution for over the counter deodorants such as this.
577	5	I have made this my popcorn of choice.  I enjoy the flavor and kernal size.
578	5	I sent brisket to my sister who had all her grandchildren for a summer visit. She got the brisket and served it and her grandchildren went crazy over it! You know how hard it is to find things kids will eat and they devoured it because it was so tender and delicious.
579	5	What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what  Crema e Gusto  is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting. I can not stress enough how good this coffee is iced!<br /><br />I am defiantly enjoying the LavAzza and may try other varieties to make hot coffee but this is my go to for iced coffee from now on!
580	5	This is excellent coffee. Bold and rich, it easily surpasses the crowd favorites, Eight O'clock and Dunkin Donuts. I'm now on autoship.
581	5	I have been searching for a mix for vegetarian gravy with a beef type flavor.  This is the best I have found.  The mock chicken version by Hain is not to my liking so if you have tried that one don't let it prevent you from enjoying the brown gravy mix.  Whole Foods used to carry in bulk mix for chicken broth/gravy that was very good but seems to have discontinued it.  The only vegetarian gravy better than this brown gravy mix comes with a tofurkey that is mushroom gravy that is prepared and frozen.  This is simple and handy and relatively inexpensive and as tasty as any meat based gravy mix.
582	5	The Other Brother and I realized the other day that we've somehow been posting these reviews for ten years already.  Suffice it to say, The Wife has long since lost any sense of excitement she may ever have felt at the piles of free books that have come our way.  At this point, each thud of a package dropped on our front porch produces at best a cringe, at worst a snarl.  Best, that is, until the other day, when we received samples -- through the Amazon Vine program -- of two new nuts from Emerald: Cocoa Roast Almonds and Marcona Almonds.  I like the Marconas, which taste kind of like Macadamias, but don't have the almost soapy texture that has rendered them inedible to me since childhood.  She loves the dark chocolate one, which,  satisfies both the salty and the sweet urge in one snack.   These latter are most notable because they manage to leave a pleasant chocolate aftertaste--not always the case in flavored foods.  Big thumbs up!
583	5	My favorite snack bar. Tasty and nutritious. Get it here and save. These bars run $3+ at any NYC deli. The nerve!
584	5	With my favorite brand no longer available, I decided to try the Coffee Bean Direct.  The dark house brew had a pleasing flavor, a hint of sweetness and no bitterness.  All in all, a little better that my usual brand, and at a respectable price. The 80 oz. bad is large and should last at least a month, but being bagged, refrigeration is a must.  A finely ground, dark roast, it even looked appealing when I opened the bag.  So unless you are into grinding your own, this is a solid choice, for a strong, bold cup of coffee.
585	5	I'm addicted to these things!  They have the best BBQ flavor of any chip I've ever tried!  And SO low in fat and calories.  A single  serving is almost a full cereal bowl.  No greasy after taste - Awesome!  I've tried all the other flavor and they are tasty as well, but BBQ are definitely my go-to snack!
586	5	I bought 238 Barbara's Bakery Multigrain Fig Bars, Wheat Free, Fat Free, 12-Ounce Boxes, for my pet green iguana. Unfortunately, he died as a result from too much grease intake a few weeks before. So I was stuck with the 238 Boxes.<br /><br />Multigrain is not my favorite but these are really fresh, good and tasty. They are sweet and taste natural. Very good product.<br /><br />My neighbor, Halbert, who is part of the fat acceptance movement, invited himself over to eat them since they expire in 3 months. He clocks in at 560 lbs. He comes over to watch TV and eat these, imposing himself upon my company, which is annoying.<br /><br />So far, no complaints and he has gas problems, which I found out. The organic figs help him out I think. Hopefully he'll finish eating them soon so he can stop bothering me.
587	3	Taste great, clean with no aftertaste.  Better than filtered water from my fridge, slightly.  Worth the extra money, not really. With just one bottle, there isn't a way for us to tell if this water would make a differnce say after 1 week, month, year. At this point, we don't think it's worth the extra money to give it a try for that long.
588	5	Before our new pup arrived I bought toys, grooming aids, cleaning products, bags of food and a variety of treats that are bite-size and on the soft side.  Callie likes these Chicken and Venison Jerky Treats so I use them as  special  treats for special behavior and cut them up so they are tinier.  I would certainly add these treats to my  must have  list for Callie.
589	2	I paid over $13.00 for  expedited  delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again.
590	5	This is the best coating/glaze to help make BBQ Chicken. I never can find it is the stores so I always buy it here and it is so much cheaper then a store. I pour it in a pie pan roll the chicken in it then bake. After I roll all the chicken I put the remaining glaze in a Zip Lock gallon bag and place in the freezer till the next time. Sometimes I mix the glaze with plain Chicken Shake n Bake for a crunchy BBQ coating.
591	1	I read all the reviews before I bought the corn husks and it was all good reviews so I went ahead and orderd 3 packages. Big mistake the first package was all dirty with bugs, corn silk, and mold. I expect the package to have some corn silk and some (2 or 3 ) molded husks, but when I have to throw all 3 bags,  away that makes me mad and I'm not going to return husks I already opend and tried to wash. So it was a big waste of my money and thoses of you who gave them a good review were either working for them, lieing or are lucky they got good husks.
592	5	I bought this product for a housewarming gift along with some gourmet hot chocolate mix.  It was a huge hit.  It comes boxed exactly as pictured and the stirrers are delicious!  Such a lovely touch for a special cup of cocoa.  My friend said it was yummy in a cup of coffee too. Very nice classy touch for a creative gift.
593	5	My 1 year old cocker spaniel loves to chew on these wraps!  She gets so excited when she finds them!  Her  cousins  also like stealing them when they are around.  They are definietly a favorite and keep them occupied for extended periods of time.  The only down side is they leave little crumbs on the floor...although, Sami always goes back and cleans up after herself!
594	3	This lemonade is not my favorite flavor. It has a really fruity taste. I prefer the peach to the mango flavor. Although regular is my favorite and raspberry is my next favorite. If you love fruity lemonade you will love this! :)
595	3	These taste fantastic but give you the worst gas, not smelly gas but LOUD gas.  Beware.
596	5	So these are jelly with little pieces of lychee, pretty simple and delicious, but its way too overpriced here. You can find it online at other stores for $6 for the same sized box. Don't buy it from amazon.
597	5	My 13 Month old goes nuts for these! He started eating the regular ones at 6 months and loves them. He is egg and peanut allergic so I loved that they are allergy free. He has recently been diagnosed as gluten intolerant and I was disappointed he would have to give up puffs, since he loves them and they are so convienient. I came on amazon to cancel my subscribe and save and discovered not only one but two gluten free flavors! Ordered both immediately and went to the grocery store and bought a canister of sweet potato to hold us until our order comes in. My son loves them just as much as the others. It is so hard to find convienient gluten free snacks for fiddlers,  thanks HappyBaby!
598	5	This is pretty powerful coffee so I mix one brick with one pound of Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  The combo of this potent Lavazza brew with the more bland DD joe is Dy-No-Mite!
599	5	My only complaint about these little bars are they are too small!  They are lightly sweetened, not sickening sweet like a lot of these types of snacks are. I'm not big on desserts or things that are very sweet.  I love dark chocolate and things that are lightly sweetened, closer to the way things are naturally.  There is just the right balance of oats, coconut and chocolate- but not only chocolate- dark chocolate. It was a little strange to have five bars in a pack. I thought someone had eaten my last bar when I went back for the sixth.  I love the fact that they are sweetened naturally without processed sugars or artificial sweeteners.  And, they're gluten free. But, I didn't feel like I was sacrificing anything when I ate them.
600	5	Have been making these muffins once a week for 9 years for my husband. He loves them.<br />We started with Sunmaid brand and these are the same.<br />Getting them delivered to the house is great.<br />Even made a batch to take along on our vacation this week to San Diego.
601	4	This is a great all around product. It's great to have the travel bottles handy. They soy formula was also great for my little one at first. It relieved all the discomfort he was having with milk-based formulas. However, after a few days I noticed that he was developing a rash on his body and face which seemed like eczema. I continued to use the product for 2 months since he seemed to really enjoy it and I attributed the rash to excessive heat and/or the detergent we were using. After changing all these variables I switched the formula again and low and behold his rash pretty much completely disappeared in less than 24 hours. So, great product, but just be careful with soy allergies as it may not be obvious right away.
602	5	My cats love  wild  foods. I had been getting this locally but then it got harder to find. I was surprised and glad when I found it on line at Amazon. This is a treat for the cats, but one I will continue to purchase.<br />Texture is solid, but moist, not like some cans that are all gravy.<br />Venison is probably the favorite between Rabbit, Venison and Duck.
603	5	This was very well done. The product was shipped in excellent condition, and the food tasted just as well as if I had bought it from a local store. It's a good mix of healthy ingredients and solid taste.
604	5	I am absolutly addicted to this product.  It has major crunch, and I feel good about snacking when these are on hand.<br />I love them!
605	5	Recommend it to all.  Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker.  I loved it during a URI, upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous.  Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing.  I now brew it for cold tea as well.  Very refresshing.
606	4	Wolfgang puck k cups are under the radar - their coffees are smooth and delicious and Jamaica Me Crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market. Island coconut is quite poor in comparison.
607	2	There are supposed to be 3 flavors (barbecue, kettle corn, and habanero) of popcorn in each muslin bag.  I ordered this popcorn mainly for the barbecue and habanero flavors, not for the kettle corn that has a salty/sweet flavor.  The reason for the 2 star review is that after opening and popping the entire contents of two of the muslin bags, I found that even though two individual bags were marked as barbecue, it tasted like the kettle corn flavor.  I think the bags were miss-marked and resulted in 4 of 6 individual bags of popcorn being the kettle corn flavor.  ICK!!!  I guess if you like kettle corn popcorn you might like this item, but don't expect to get anything resembling barbecue flavor.<br /><br />I did like the habanero flavor, it was very spicy, seemed fresh and virtually every kernel popped. Since one only gets 6 individual bags of the habanero flavor, this purchase wasn't worth the price to me.
608	5	Starbucks decaf Via is a great thing for travelers, and this product is actually a very good buy.  The Vias usually sell for about $1 per serving.
609	5	My massage therapist recommended this item for my muscle cramps. She was right on!!<br />I only use 1/4 tsp a day and I mix it with grape juice to mask the not so yummy taste but soooo...worth it!!<br />It also helps keep me regular which is a BONUS!!<br />Great product!
610	2	Like several other reviewers, my order just arrived and every can is dented.  None of them seem to be compromised so I will use them.  Just disappointing to receive something like this from Amazon.  I know it probably isn't their fault but they are still shipping it from their warehouse.  Would hate to receive other products in this condition. Farmer's Market should be ashamed of themselves. Having said that, I am pleased to receive them and so is my cat!  I have a feeling that people will be grabbing as much as they can of the 2010 pumpkin crop.
611	5	I loved peanut butter all my life.  On warm toast in the mornings, it didn't get better.  But something happened and peanut butter doesn't like me anymore.  I've tried so many other butters since and not found anything to replace peanut butter........ until now.  This Barney Butter has the exact same consistency of peanut butter.  You will not know the difference.  It has the same color as peanut butter.  It even has the little nut nuggets to make it crunch like crunchy peanut butter.  I will buy this again and again.  I cannot believe how lucky I was to run across it at Amazon.  I would totally recommend it to anyone who is looking for a peanut butter substitute.  You WILL NOT be disappointed.
612	5	I wonderful seasoning that is void of unnecessary sodium and chemicals.  You want chili powder and chili powder is what you get.  I season near everything with this great spice.  my only complaint in the packaging.  I much prefer a short fat jar to a tall skinny one.
613	4	I'm guessing that the  Eat.Think.Smile  name is a tie in to the trend toward  slow foods  in cooking and  mindful eating  in dieting.  As in, do not grab the bag of cheetos and just start gobbling.<br /><br />These crackers do fit that bill, but taste is subjective.  I had to hold back from the gobbling, being a fan of subtle cocoa-y flavors (such as in chili or mole) and mildly salty snacks. My picky middle kid also liked these:   Weird, but good!   But the rest of the family ranged from  Huh?  to  Please never give me this again!   Forever the optimist, I may yet try to introduce these as toppings for a fruity salad or ice cream or something.<br /><br />Health digression:  much is made on the packaging here of the benefits of whole grains (brown rice, oats, sesame seed) and the antioxidant power of cocoa.  I'm with food author Michael Pollen here -  superfood  claims are marketing, pure and simple, and processed  super  snacks can't begin to compare - healthwise - to fresh, unprocessed foods.  Still, these crisps beat the heck out of most packaged snacks, and I'd gladly recommend them for toddlers over the usual cheerios, except for one timely caution:  at this writing, recent news reports have raised alarms over the (trace) arsenic levels in brown rice products - flour, syrup, etc. - with an emphasis on the concern over brown rice syrup in infant formulas.  This, as the rice plant has a natural affinity for arsenic and takes up that dangerous metal along with the chemically similar silica that rice requires for growth.  (White rice, which is simply hulled brown, retains less - but some - of this trace metal.)  Arsenic based pesticides - used for decades - can persist in the soil even where long discontinued, so experts addressing the arsenic-in-rice issue have recommended looking for organic brown rices.<br /><br />It doesn't look to me like Apure Foods (maker of Eat.Think.Smile) sources organic rice, or other organic ingredients, for that matter.  I'm pretty sure they'd tout it on their packaging and website, were that so. But really, if ordinary rice is a normal part of your diet, there's no point in getting worked up over a more occasional snack source.<br /><br />But why, oh why are these crackers called  thins ?  They are small and  puffed out , much like the kitty treats in our household.  (Note to self: Do not mix up.)  They are also MINE.  I guess if you like these, you really do.
614	4	These cups are great. I have been reusing the originals and putting aluminum foil for the top.  These make it much easier and you can reuse them also.
615	4	We ordererd Just the Cheese Crispy Cool Ranch Cheese snacks. They arrived on time and we tried them the next day. Finding snacks that you can incorporate into a low carb diet is difficult sometimes. This is a very good low carbohydrate snack. These have No MSG, wheat and are gluten free as well. They would be good for any type of diet. Only 75 calories and 1/2 carb per serving. They taste quite good. I've made cheese chips at home and these taste very much like them. We are looking forward to trying another flavor next time.
616	4	These are highly addictive and so delicious! They come in a beautiful, festive box, and each piece is individually wrapped. While that does keep it all extra fresh, it also produces an awful lot of wasteful trash, hence the rating.
617	5	When we got our German Shepherd his parents were being fed this food and he was getting the puppy version of it.  After doing a little research I've found that this is a good quality dog food.  And it's specifically engineered for German Shepherds which have notoriously sensitive stomachs. I've tried other foods and with this one my dogs coat looks a lot healthier and he has more energy. It also lasts longer than a #40 bag of the cheap dog food since he doesn't have to eat as much to get full. I used to get this food at Petsmart but I have to drive 40 min either east or west from where I live to get to a Petsmart so I found it to be incredibly convenient to be able to order on Amazon. I still buy it at Petsmart but I don't have to make special trip just for dog food anymore. And with Amazon Prime I can get it shipped for free and it only cost about $3 more than at Petsmart but it cost more than that in gas to drive there. I've bought this here several times and will continue to buy it here since it's so convenient.
618	5	when i see the price drop again, i will buy many cases. in the meantime, whole foods sells the same kind for about $1.25 a can.
619	5	Our Boston Terrier was rescued so we are not certain of his exact age.  We do know that after enriching our lives for the past 11 years, he has slowed down considerably with a lot of graying.  We are mixing the Natural Balance with his dry food in the morning.  If the amount of speed a dog can digest food is a measure of how much they like their food, then Natural Balance is a big hit with our Lucky.  The ingredients are excellent.  He's at an age where training is no longer a concern; we just want to pamper him in a healthy way.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

621	4	I've been buying this company's cookies for many years.  They are tasty and don't seem  weird  although note that they have a rice-flour base, making them generally a tad crumblier and more delicate in flavor than cookies made with wheat flour.  They remind me of a light,  softer shortbread-type texture.  Personally I find this to be an appealing difference, adding some variety in choice (I'm not gluten intolerant but have a mild wheat allergy, so I can still eat some wheat cookies as well).  If you enjoy things like rice crackers, cream of rice, rice noodles and Asian dishes, you will probably like these and not find them strange.  In essence, I'd describe these as a lighter, more delicate version of a chocolate-chip cookie.
622	1	I broke a tooth eating the cereal.  It's not just a feeling that it could happen. I'm not happy right now.
623	5	 thinkThin Chocolate Fudge, 2.1-Ounce Bar (Pack of 10)  taste excellent so long as they are always kept at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and below 80 degrees Fahrenheit. I live in the desert southwest, so when I first ordered these from Amazon last summer, and it was well over 110 degrees Fahrenheit, what I received was a mess, so I put them in the Fridge. Went from too hot to too cold, the taste was gritty and messy as the chocolate enrobing shattered and fell off, still better than 110 degree puddles I was first presented.  Now that it's winter, and the weather is between 40 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, every bar I have received from Amazon has been perfect. I store the bars at room temperature. The bars are smooth, moist and chewy, perfect in all the ways I expected.  I will need to order a 6 month supply before May if I want to enjoy these bars during the very hot summer months. So, for everyone who is having taste troubles with these particular bars, try to schedule a shipment when your local weather will be  above 40 degrees Fahrenheit and below 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
624	4	This Tea is really good. It comes in an easy to use container.  Its not very sweet so if you want your tea really sweet you may need to add something. Good produxt.
625	5	The price at amazon varies for this product, it is competitive unless it gets to almost 30 for 4.  Quality is good.
626	5	Yogi Teas are the highest quality--organic, earth-friendly, and flavorful. I prefer them to any other brand. The calming tea is slightly spicy and relaxing; the packaging is good for the environment. I love reading the exercises and philosophical messages on the box. Yogi Tea is the bomb!
627	5	This is really great decaf coffee, with a dark roast that is hard to find. And it's at a great price.  And you can get a subscription to it.  I have been getting this once a month for the past few months and absolutely love it
628	5	My dog is extremely picky - when he gets a new treat or a food he is unfamiliar with, he will spit it out after the first taste. Even when he likes a particular treat, there's no guarantee he will continue to eat it, so it is tough to find things he will like long term.  I bought a small bag of chicken poppers just to try.  Not only did my dog like them on first taste, but he has not become bored with them.  I bought the 1lb canister and when that is finished I will be stocking up on plenty more.
629	3	As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those  duh  products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of  treat.   It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it  makes pills a treat to give! <br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger  capsule  dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />For dogs, 5 stars. For cats, I'm only giving 3 stars, as only one of my two cats will eat them!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of  It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet  and  It's a Cat's World...

630	5	I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!
631	5	After purchasing <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUHG >Kopali goldenberries</a>, I tried a few other Kopali snacks: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIRCZ6 >chocolate covered cacao nibs</a> and <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUTE >chocolate covered banana</a>.<br /><br />The goldenberries are the best dried fruit I have ever had. They are bursts of sweet and tangy flavor and achieve the same satisfaction as sour gummies. Grown in Columbia, goldenberries are high in antioxidants, bioflavonoids, fiber, and even contain protein. They are a great snack and are somewhat filling.<br /><br />The dark chocolate covered nibs are also good. The small package contains a lot more nibs than it seems at first. The nibs are crunchy, high in antioxidants, and a little bit bitter, but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely.<br /><br /> The chocolate covered bananas were also delicious. I expected them to be crispy, but instead they were chewy and a bit zesty. Each of the Kopali Organics products is a healthy and satisfying snack. You should try them (especially the goldenberries)!
632	5	We first bought these from a local health food store because my son had food allergies.  Kids love them.  They do have a bit of a soy taste, but I still think they are wonderful.  We also use them as croutons on salads.  They aren't as good as junkfood, so if you're a junk food junkie, I doubt you'll like them.  But, if you're into health food, you'll probably love these.
633	5	Our australian shepard puppies love these! and they are the perfect size for training and to put in their treat balls.
634	5	These cookies are one of those childhood favorites that cannot help but please the palette.<br />They arrived in perfect condition and having these little 4 cookie packages is perfect for a sweet treat.
635	5	Buy more than one box - these disappear fast! Bahlsen Biscuits are elegant, impressive, and delight everyone. I keep some on hand for unexpected guests and these  Hazelnut Biscuits  have never disappointed anyone! (Betcha YOU could eat a whole box yourself!)
636	4	Tim Burton is a guy Hollywood should honor every day. He's one of the few who agree to stay in the system and direct personal movies for the majors.<p>And his personal world is something very special. Things have a soul or, at least, come to life under Burton's camera. <p>Beetlejuice is one of the first efforts of Tim Burton and it's already great. There's a style, a signature, a world , details which reveal an authentic creator.<p>It's possible you will hate this world but you will not have losed two hours, I guarantee you. Come and see what can be created with a camera and a little brain. <p>A DVD I'm proud to have in my collection.
637	2	I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)
638	2	I bought this cereal recently. The flakes are good-they don't get too soggy. The chocolate, not so good. It left a thick waxy coating on the roof of my mouth. I didn't think the taste was bad overall, just didn't like the waxy feeling. I will finish the box, but I doubt I'll buy it again. I guess that's what I get for trying to eat chocolate for breakfast!
639	4	These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today.
640	5	My daughter cannot get enough of these delicious snacks and I have a pretty hard time telling her no since they are made of nothing but pure, organic, pureed fruits!  The packaging is fantastic to toss into your bag for on the go too.  All the flavors are great and if you want to try them before committing to a bulk amount Starbucks now carries the line in-store.  ;)
641	2	Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like.
642	4	Vitamin Squeeze is an innovative all-natural water additive that infuses flavor, vitamins, and caffeine.  The bottle contains 24 squeezes which makes 24 8 ounce glasses of water.  Compared to similar vitamin infused water, you are saving about 50 cents per 16 oz bottle.<br />The fruit punch flavor tastes similar to sugar free kool-aid.  It is sweetened with sucralose and the ascorbic acid from the Vitamin C.  The concentrate is red and will stain your clothes and hands if you don't wash them right away.<br />Each 8 oz serving contains 120% Vitamin C, 40% Vitamins B6, B5, B3, and B12, and 10% chromium and zinc.<br />Does it really give you energy?  Hard to say, because so many other things can factor in, but I drink this at lunch and I do feel like I get a boost through the afternoon.  I have replaced my lunch time diet pop with this which I believe is a healthier alternative.<br />Overall this is a really cool product and healthy alternative to other energy drinks and pops.
643	1	Don't waste your money. The ingredients list includes 'spices' which obviously means cinnamon. I simply do not understand cinnamon being used in chili. Even after adding ground beef, diced tomatoes and shredded cheese on top... the taste was still disgusting!
644	4	Expecting something like Fanta or Sunkist I was surprised how smooth and subtle Switch is. Definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor. Love the fact that it doesn't tast too carbonated.
645	3	Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are indeed soft. Individual wrapping of each cookie ensures that they stay soft and fresh until your are ready to eat them. Unfortunately, they are very bland tasting, which is a surprise for Quaker products. I wouldn't buy them if you expect a flavorful cookie. So you trade soft and fresh for flavorful. So if you are looking for cookies that excite your taste buds, I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere.
646	5	I have a 14 year old son whom I just got custody of and I have been trying to curb the processed sugar intake ... the vice he would not let go of was cheap maple syrup. I tried everything - the pure organic and he hated everything ... until this. I highly recommend this as it gives him the flavor he wants with just the right amount of sweetness and I can rest easy knowing he isn't putting processed sugars into his system.
647	5	These clams taste good. I particularly like the lightness of the oil.  It's a handy item to keep for earthquake preparedness, equally good with noodles or plain crackers.
648	5	So you take the plunge and buy yourself a coffee pot that takes K-cups but you are not sure what flavor to buy. Do yourself a favor and get this variety pack to experience different coffee flavors.
649	3	I love the pretzels; I just do not like having to buy such a large quantity at one time. I had to get 12 bags at one time, I have 10 bags left, today is Sept. 17th and the expiration date on the bags is Oct. 10th. There is no way that I am going to eat 10 bags of pretzels in 3 weeks; I am the only one in my family who eats them. Now I know that they will not go  bad,  but I do not want stale pretzels. I cannot find them in stores anymore, so I had to buy them because I do love them so much and Amazon.com was the only place that I could find them. I am going to have to cancel my current ongoing order with Amazon and try to find another option where I do not have to get so much at one time.
650	5	Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar, this item caught my attention when I read it was an ingredient in  Xylichew  chewing gums.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It is commercially manufactured from  xylan hemicellulose  sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This  NOW  Xylitol is actually made from a corn source.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates.<br /><br />Each teaspoon contains:<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Sugar Alcohol 4g<br />Sodium 0mg<br />Protein 0g<br /><br /> Now  Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes.<br /><br />When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea. It only seems to contain .45 grams of Sugar Alcohol per packet. Both are great sweet alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />If you are tired of the aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners, give these products a try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
651	5	I am a vegetarian trying my best to move to veganism, but it is difficult to find yummy alternatives for my favorite foods. This oatmeal has hit the vegan nail on the head. It is delicious but also convenient and affordable. The serving size is plenty ample for a morning meal. Will definitely be purchasing more of these in other flavors!
652	4	We like the Verona Coffee. We do note the name change from Bold to Dark and will see if coffee is the same.<br />Best part is the fast regular shipping.
653	2	Let me say I like a medium roast coffee.. and this is NOT a medium roast coffee. I would call this Light or very LIGHT.<br />This comes as indicated in the description in single coffee pods for use with Single pod coffee makers.<br /> I notice when I opened the package the coffee smell was missing.. Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it.. I even opened a 2nd package to see if my first didn't get punctured accidentally.. but sadly it wasn't..<br />  I even brewed this in my  single serve coffee maker on BOLD setting.. but it just didn't do anything to improve it.<br /><br /> I do support the concept of this coffee company but this particular type of coffee is not to my taste.But saying that  everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee and tea so this is just my PERSONAL OPINION AND TASTE.. Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me.
654	5	I am not going to review why Xylitol is great or beneficial. I am not going to comment on the effects of chewing gum to reduce cavities, lose weight, catch the eye of the person on the subway you are attracted to, or eliminate planters warts on the bottoms of your feet. I will not go into the wonders of this gum, and how I keep packs in my desk at work, in my car, and under my pillow for those late night cravings.<br /><br />However, I will state that this is a great price to pay for twenty packs of this gum. In the stores, this gum runs about $2 a pack. The price I paid through Amazon is less than 75 cents per pack. I no longer have to feel guilty when I take that second piece because sometimes one piece just isn't enough.<br /><br />This is a great, guilt free, chemical free, wonderful tasting and long lasting gum. If there were just some way to harness the power from gum chewers' jaws into a clean energy...
655	4	I ate them all anyway.  There are new flavors for gummi bears that I got in Germany in October and these were not the same, so I was a little disappointed.  But these are still better than what you get in the supermarket, so every now and then they're worth the splurge...
656	4	It's great to have this delivered to my house, on a schedule. My dogs like Pedigree. I mix this with the canned food. It feeds two dogs one 50 lbs. on 28lb.s twice a day.
657	5	This Cinnamon Oat Cluster cereal looks like granola, but is dryer and lower in fat and calories than my favorite granola, Bear Naked All Natural Granola, Fruit and Nut, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6). In fact this whole grain cereal by Kind Healthy Grains has half the fat. So for everyday consumption, this cereal is quite tasty. Another characteristic of this cereal worth noting--the wholesome taste of the whole grain blend really comes through.<br /><br />I like to put cereal with fruit and yogurt. The nice this about this product is that it stays crunchy in milk or yogurt. So if crunch is something you like in your cereal, this one is a real keeper.
658	3	There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those  single shot  type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.
659	3	Go to [...] to order these.  The price there is [...] for a box of 24.  If you order 4 packages of kcups, you get free shipping.  If you sign up for their mail notifications (join their coffee club.) you'll get 10 to 15 percent off.  They ship rather quickly.  But, if you want this tea for winter, you better order quickly because it tends to sell out around Christmas time or Thanksgiving.  I like the Mandarin Spice, and the Lemon Zinger.  All together, for 4 packages of tea (48 kcups of Mandarin, and 48 kcups of Lemon Zinger, my total was [...]  My only problem with the Kuerig site is that it is not too user friendly.  Go to  at home  and then  shop  and you should find everything you need :)
660	5	My dog loves these and he no longer has salmon breath from his food.  I give him one a day and his teeth also look super clean.  I actually have not been brushing his teeth- he refuses to let me and he is 85lbs and the vet commented on how clean his teeth look.  They are made with healthy ingredients and no fillers.  I will continue to buy these.
661	1	This is a great tasting salad, but beware of the food dyes, both the frozen and the fresh kinds have FD&C Yellow and Blue dyes, which I noticed after I bought it.  When I opt for a healthy food, I prefer no chemicals, especially ones that have been linked to various health hazards. I would opt for a paler looking seaweed, rather than one pumped with dyes. Here is a link with more info about food coloring:<br />[...]
662	5	The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.
663	5	I bought this tea from my local chinese supermarket in Houston.  This is a very good tea with light and sweet aroma.  I highly recommend this team but try to find this locally in a Chinese store because you may be able to find it for under $10.
664	4	We have been ordering this coffee for over a year and we like it better than any other coffees we have tried. Sometimes the beans are fresh and look oily. Other times they are dry and lack aroma. We were ordering direct from Coffee Bean Direct and got fresher coffee than the coffer we get from Amazon on the automatic ordering system to save money. I don't know if they warehouse the coffee longer than the Coffee Bean Direct or what. There is a difference. If the freshness does not improve soon We will go back to ordering from Coffee Bean Direct and paying more. When it is fresh it is a five-star coffee.
665	5	You should try these singles if you drink just one cup of coffee in the morning. They taste the same as normally brewed coffee, but it could take some time to get the brew process just right for you.<br /><br />Pros versus a coffee pot brewer: Less waste, less mess, less time to brew<br /><br />Cons: Doesn't work well for multiple cups of coffee, prone to error<br /><br />Because the brew process has to be manually performed by a person, it is easy for someone to make a watery cup of coffee using these. It wasn't until I got the process down that my cups started tasting like real coffee. Ultimately this is the same stuff you put in a pot brewer, so it tastes the exact same if done right.<br /><br />When you read the instructions, its important to follow all of the steps. There are three important parts: HOT water, steep time, and dunk time.<br /><br />HOT water: I have an electric tea kettle which can boil a cup of water in about 1 minute. I like it because it automatically turns off after the water is boiling, and its less mess than microwaving a pyrex container or a pot on the stove. Mine is a white plastic one that cost about $12. I highly recommend this method because it will get the water the right temperature every time.<br /><br />Steep time: After pouring the hot water into a mug with the coffee single bag, the instructions tell you to wait a minute. My experience is you can vary this time depending on preference. More time equals stronger coffee. I generally let it sit for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />Dunk time: The part of the instructions I skipped over my first time was the dunking process. The instructions say to dunk the bag into the cup for 15 seconds. I find this process is where a large portion of the coffee flavor comes from. Once again this can be varied to suit taste. I generally dunk for 10-20 seconds.<br /><br />After performing the steps as the box says, it ends up tasting just like normal coffee. If you're used to strong coffee, all you have to do is let it steep longer, dunk longer, or put multiple bags in at the same time.<br /><br />I like this product and use it exclusively now. It ends up cost me less than how much I was spending making small pots of coffee. Its also more convenient for me. Highly recommend giving this a try
666	4	This is a quick an easy breakfast. I just had boiling water from the kettle and I am good to go. I found I need a few to do trial and error to get the right level of water for me. The packets where just the right size for me. My husband however has found he needs two at a time to make sure he has enough for breakfast.
667	2	I have super thick, naturally wavy hair that I dye a lot.  It frizzes a lot.  The problem I have with products is always finding that balance between getting the frizz to go away or when it does my hair looks to greasy, blech.  I usually end up just not using much or flat ironing and using higher end product.  Anyways, tried this, it is the greasiest stuff I have ever used, and that's with using a dime-sized amount away from my scalp of course, and again my hair is super thick, I usually get it thinned 1-2 times a year.  Then the smell, blech, not for me.  I just rewashed my hair and went back to my regular $10 a bottle stuff, sigh.  Oh well, tossing this!  Not for me or my hair.  Nothing ever seems to work right on my hair, even the expensive stuff, but at least that helps  some  and tones it down a little, lol.  I wouldn't recommend this.  You're better off just using vegetable oil for all the good it does, seriously.  Not that you'd want to do that!
668	5	I have had my keurig for a couple of months and have tried many different kinds of coffies,ciders, cappuccino,etc...<br />So far, this is my favorite cappuccino. What makes it even better?  Amazon and subscribe and save!
669	1	This is good cocoa, but you'd almost have better luck just opening the K-cup and stirring it in. I have found that if I make it as per the box directions, I'll have about 1/4 of the cocoa still inside the cup.<br /><br />Also, you do not want to do this on the large cup size - it will be so diluted that will not want to drink it. I make it using the middle sized cup and use 2 k-cups.<br /><br />I got this on sale for $7, so it wasn't too bad of a price, but I think in the future I will just stick to buying a container of hot cocoa.
670	5	My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.
671	5	Love the Bigelow Earl Grey in the bags and thought I would try the K-cups.  Wow!  The smell is divine and the taste is even better than the bagged sibling tea.<br /><br />I don't think you'll find a better Earl Grey.
672	5	This is one of few organic,fair trade non-alkaline processed cocoa powders I've found, and Rapunzel is way more reasonable than some of its gourmet competitors .. I hope that doesn't mean they'll raise their prices! I tasted it side-by-side with a similar organic product I'd been using, which was alkaline processed, and you CAN tell the difference .. Rapunzel tasted better!
673	5	I am writing on behalf of a good friend, who received this bundle as a gift.<br /><br />She wrote to me:  I couldn't believe the handwritten notes included in<br />the packet. The mixes were such high quality, as they contained only<br />real food ingredients - not a bunch of chemicals and artificial or<br />engineered 'natural' flavors. The chili and corn bread taste GREAT! I made<br />the chili in a copper pot, so it cooked more quickly than the recipe suggested<br />as though it had simmered all day. Yum. <br /><br />Not only are their products wonderful, the Beans are wonderful, and<br />the Project is wonderful and impressive and heartwarming. This makes<br />a great gift to others - and to the women in the Project. Win - win!
674	5	I'm a health food nut, I eat clean, fresh and as much organic as my wallet allows.  I nurse my 6 mo old and make his baby food.  I wanted a cereal that I felt was as clean as his organic baby food I was making and as my milk is...I LOVE this cereal...he digests it easily, it never constipated him...I think thats due to the additives this particular cereal has.  I will never try another cereal.  I am excited to try the oatmeal though!
675	4	The spice package is convenient and tasty.  However I was expecting it to be a bit spicier...there was no heat to the product at all.  Next time I'll add curry to make it perfect.  Despite this review, I will buy again.
676	3	I recently had a coupon for the new Uber Larabar and thought I'd try it when it was on display at my local grocery store. Unfortunately, it's not my favorite bar. Flavor-wise it tastes just like the Cherry Pie Lara bar plus a handful of nuts (almonds, pecans, and cashews.  For my taste, I was too sweet, which is strange considering that I was craving a sweet snack and normally sweet is just my thing.  The fat grams (12!!) are just not worth it for me.  I'd rather have a simpler nut bar...or a slice of actual Cherry Cobbler!  Hmmm. bottom line:  If you're a fan of the Cherry Pie Lara Bar and want some added nuts, this will likely be perfect for you.
677	5	I gave this as a gift and was told it was absolutely delicious and arrived on time and nicely wrapped.I would definitely reccomend this product to anyone.
678	5	When we lost our 15- and 19-year-old cats we adopted two new kittens and wanted to do right by them. Had been feeding the older boys Prescription Diet per our vet to manage diabetes and hyperthyroid/kidney failure. After one new kitten started putting on the pounds (on Science Diet Light), our (otherwise fab) vet told us Voodoo would have to go on weight loss Prescription Diet soon, which the vet described as  like cat popcorn.  That didn't sound too good, so we started researching and found Core. Gave it a shot. Our younger kitten immediately started losing weight (slowly), Voodoo stopped gaining, both boys have more energy and glossier coats and they're maintaining a reasonable weight ... it's a wonderful thing, especially if you've had older cats with health issues. Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />The adjustment isn't too smooth (and it smells awful, especially the wet) but now the boys won't eat anything else. (Even seared ahi tuna left on the counter, which is nuts!) Just mix whatever kibble you're feeding them with the Core dry for a while and they'll be hooked. The wet we presented as a  special treat  and let them share a half can every night. Worth the effort and expense!
679	5	My little eater isn't picky, but the spinach, mango and pear is his favorite food of all.  The food is tasty, although it's a little bit expensive at Amazon.  The grocery store and the big boxes tend to have this one a little bit cheaper.  Thankfully, Happy foods are becoming increasingly easy to find.  Good products and tasty foods = well, Happy Baby!
680	4	I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.  We received a free sample of Lickety Stik at our puppy training class because of a pug's tendency to pack on the pounds and I was really surprised at how quickly the puppy took to it.  He will do tricks and readily follow on the leash to get a lick of this treat and becomes excited when he sees the bottle.<br /><br />The main drawback to this thing is that it stinks to high heaven and if I get a strong whiff of it the thing makes me gag.  The dog loves it, however so I am really considering buying more of this product in the future.
681	5	I have a small patio garden outside my dining room and it is enclosed on three sides with a one mostly western exposure. I have a potted garden and with the desert climate and the exposure conditions it's always a challenge to keep plants alive. I give them a little help with this Miracle Grow. I don't use the hose and feeder system, just a little bit of a cap full in a gallon jug of water that I carry out to the patio. Couldn't be more easy.<br /><br />This refill pack is economical and easy to store. Works very well to keep the plants healthy.
682	5	i love, love, love the coffee. not too strong, but perfect for a cup of joe. very affordable brand and worth every penny.
683	1	I was so excited by the positive reviews here, so I gave this a shot.  I have a decent Krups drip coffee maker that makes good coffee using lots of other brands (I usually buy my coffee at Trader Joes or Whole Foods).  I grind my beans just before drinking and experimented three times with this Lavazza Gran Filtro.  At first I thought I made the coffee too weak; then too strong; then assumed I had not ground the beans properly.  All three pots were horrid.  The strongest brew had a weird chemical after-taste that would not go away even after chewing gum.  Yuck!<br /><br />Anyone want to buy my unopened second bag?
684	2	Great salt and the grinder looks nice, but it continually jams and no salt comes out. We have quit using it. Too much trouble to keep clearing it.
685	3	Bought the Fiesta Lime chips and they were decent. The flavor was somewhat bland and I guess I was expecting something that had some spice/kick to it.
686	5	These are tasty crackers.  They do not break on the perforations, but that is not a prerequisite for delicious--and that is the word.  The crackers are good alone, or smeared with something, or combined with custard and bananas.  A box of these will not last long, once it is opened and sampled.
687	4	While we liked the taste of the bread, it was so  crumby  and cakelike that it was hard to slice and even harder to eat.  It kept falling apart! I bought the  six-pack , so I'll use all of them, but doubt if I'll buy again.
688	5	I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.<br /><br />I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine.
689	5	Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the  soft  end of the  soft/crunchy  spectrum.  Ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest, but Kettle brand chips are far more crunchy.  If you have a tender mouth or bad teeth (dentures) you might want to steer clear of Kettle brand.  Otherwise, you'll love these chips.  The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are super TANGY.  I enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time.  I am dissapointed with all other Salt & Vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and/or the vinegar taste whimpy and/or chemically.  Rest assured Kettle Sea Salt & Vinegar has a gourmet flavor.  The vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could NEVER be called whimpy!
690	5	These breakfast cookies are delicious! They have a fresh ginger taste, and they really do keep you full. I usually have a small snack about two hours after breakfast, but since eating these, I don't feel hungry again for at least 4 hours. At 290 calories, I would recommend them to anyone who needs a quick, healthy breakfstt.
691	5	Both my 19 year old cats love this. I decided to use Amazon's subscribe and save plan so I'd always have a supply on hand.  With the 15% discount, the price is about $.24 less than the grocery store's.<br />They also like the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NVJFQ >Whiskas Temptations Creamy Dairy Flavour Treats for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> flavor.
692	1	I feel sure this will not be published, but, pershaps I can vent some of my frustration. I purchased the Goodlife Recipe Cat Treat Formula supplied by Amazon, but sold by Retail Lighting Solutions, Inc. The cost for this one 3 oz. bag of treats was $8.34. Now, I must have had a temporary loss of my mind to pay that for a bag of cat treats. I looked up the company mentioned in this review, all I could see was lights. I really hate being ripped off and that's exactly what I was.<br /><br />I like Amazon and whenever I need something, this is the first place I check out, then Ebay.<br /><br />I will be very aware and sure of what I'm paying in the future. I could go to Walmart and pay $1.50 for just about anything in the cat treat department.<br /><br />NOT A HAPPY CAMPER !!
693	1	The last 2 cases of Murray Sugar Free Cookies Chocolate Chip with Pecan were over cooked almost burnt.. Date Code is MAR0810EAS.  I don't have the code in front me  But I remember MAR0810Exx?<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYGXKC >Murray Sugar Free Cookies Chocolate Chip with Pecan, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>
694	3	Lots of hype, and it's difficult to really get an idea of whether this will get me back into training for the 100-yard dash.  You can tell it's been a while, as I still refer to  yards. <br /><br />So, I'll let others debate its healthfulness and whether it makes mere mortals leap tall buildings.  I kinda liked the taste, which I'd describe as between grape and cranberry.  A little residue at the bottom I guess is an indication of healthiness?  Should I have decanted it?<br /><br />It tastes OK, kind of refreshing, really.  But unless you've got money to burn, and the Olympics to train for, I find it not quite worth the cost.
695	5	I found this at a local store and I picked it just because the tin was so pretty even though I did not like earl grey tea.<br /><br />However, this was amazing!<br /><br />If you are not a big fan of earl grey from other companies, try this. You would feel like you are holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers but it does not have strong fragrance. Try this! It is amazing!<br /><br />I have not drunken black tea for a long time and this makes me a tea lover again. This is amazing, seriously.
696	2	Be aware that this collection is not from Keurig, while it does contain Keurig items, it comes in a clear plastic bag with a third party 5 x 8  information sheet from  Hound Dog Enterprises, LLC. Not good as a gift as it does not wrap or display well,  Keurig collections come in boxes.<br /><br />Purchased 11/27/11 and it came with  Best Before Dates  ranging from 3/13/12 to 6/13/12 which seems correct for Keurig.<br /><br />The website does say packaging may be different and IT IS.<br /><br />Two stars because I was surprised and disappointed when it arrived, not what I was expecting. Not the usual Amazon experience.
697	5	And my favorite nondairy milk. I think it has a nicer flavor than soy, and I try not to overdo soy products. I add <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00430EJR8 >Sweetleaf Sweetener 70 Packets</a>to it, to sweeten it while keep the calorie/glycemic count down. It could be cheaper, and with the shipping is not worth it. On sale locally, each one is $2. Regularly about $2.79.
698	5	I bought these as a bridal shower gift for a friend- I thought that they looked very pretty on the head table in their champagne flutes, but more importantly, the bride loved them.  (The groom said that they tasted good, too).  Overall, a good purchase.
699	5	These are the most awesome little energy snack possible!  Brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time...along with a box of Sharkies. Prior to this, Sharkies where our mainstay when needing a boost and energy replacement.  Have to say, even the Sharkies fan in the group had to admit Honey Stingers fairly surpassed Sharkies in both taste and performance.  Will still probably bring both next time for variety, but definitely twice as many Honey Stingers.  Honey IS the perfect food!
700	5	I discovered this at wholefooods & the mixture of nuts & fruits & seeds is just delectable. I used to buy my additions separately until I found this item.  I 100% recommend this.
701	1	I am sure this is completely my fault.  I did not realize that organic meant they would be brown (silly me I thought the package was green  like the top and that was why the picture made them look brown).  These taste more like raisins than the dried apricots I am used to.  I have been trying to like them and I like most organic things I have tried but this product makes me realize why preservatives are used.  I am going back to the pretty orange ones that taste like apricots because these taste spoiled to me.  It may be an acquired taste...
702	1	THESE ARE SOME OF THE WORST FRUIT SLICES CANDY I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE!!! THESE HAVE NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER.....LIKE EATING PASTE.CANDY FRUIT SLICES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A STRONG FLAVOR.........THESE BARELY HAVE ANY FLAVOR AT ALL...........TRUELY HORRIBLE!!!
703	5	Our australian shepard puppies love these! and they are the perfect size for training and to put in their treat balls.
704	5	my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4-6/day but that seems excessive--usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips, much like jerky--much less disgusting than some of his other treats, such as pigs feet/ears.  i will definitely continue to purchase.
705	2	We are huge fans of Merrick treats!  However, this product was disappointing.  The quality was lacking, as well as substance, mainly non descript scraps too small to be a chew treat, or large pieces of fluff.  There was no jerky, flossies, wizzlers, or any pieces/scraps of their quality treats.  Just a large bag of junk these days.  Hope Merrick goes back to the old style of quality and variety in this value pack, otherwise, this isn't a value.
706	5	I purchased a bonsai from Bonsay Boy and I'm completely satisfied with the product and services.<br />I received my bonsai 2 days after the purchase, very well packed and was beautiful.<br />I'm def buying more :)
707	3	The coffee itself is good.  Bold, Robust flavor.. it's just that you can get the same thing at the store when  it's on sale for cheaper.
708	5	I have eaten these little gems for more years than I care to admit.  But about a year ago I decided I needed to lose some weight and I began to cut out both sugar and fat items.  However, to be successful in the long term on this you shouldn't deny yourself everything and the one treat I kept was these bite-sized Mary Janes.  They're only about thirty calories each and give your taste buds a long, satisfying chew that makes you think you've eaten an entire candy bar.  I lost the weight I wanted to lose and these guys helped.  If you enjoy the rich taste of peanut butter and molasses then you should give them a try whether you're attempting to lose weight or just want something delicious to enjoy eating.  And very importantly, you'll save money buying them in bulk via an Amazon vendor.
709	2	I was expecting normal pebbles, you knmow like Fruity Pebbles or the Cocoa Variety but I got a flavorless pile of knock-off Lucky Charms. These taste nothing like the others and the texture is also pretty bad. The only good thing about them is the marshmallows, I picked them out and gave the rest to the birds and ducks in my pond. Not that cheap either. All in all I'd rate this 2 stars.
710	5	Unbelievably good for instant, and a great price at a little over $.50/cup when purchased in bulk. Great for my office and at home when I don't have the time to brew a whole pot.
711	5	I tried a lot of gluten free bread before I found Pamelas.  It is the best and you can make it in your bread machine.  It is dense and moist and tastes great and you can add items to make different variations.
712	4	I Ordered  German Johnson  tomato seeds. I got just what I ordered, looked like about 80 seeds, and four weeks ago I planted them into a prepared bed (Oct.16th ... living in southernmost Texas, my  summer  is in the winter). The price seemed a little high ($1.29), but when I realized it included S&H as well, I was happy enough. Many companies were charging more.<br />Seeds sprouted up in a week, and now 1 month after planting I count 124 plants (not bad out of  80 seeds ), mostly 4-6  tall, and ready to transplant into rows!<br />I raise vegetables organically on a small truck-garden for the Farmer Markets in my area. In a few months I'll let you know what my customers & I thought of the tomatoes themselves. Thank you, Seed Needs... sincerely.
713	2	I just did not care for this.  Put it on a bowl of cereal and tasted the sweetness an hour later.  I think it is too sweet for table sugar use but may work fine in cooking.  It is really really fine, does not look or taste like sugar.  I am always looking for a natural replacement but so far Aspertame seems to be the one I choose.  Like I said, I am always ready to find a better one, but this isn't it in my opinion.
714	5	My dog loves these chews. My 45 pound Aussie puppy devours rawhides in minutes, but these treats last for several days. Definitely worth a try!
715	5	I love it!!! I drink every morning for my energy.  Also, I drink it in the afternoon for my energy.  Green tea and black tea are the same thing to prevent cancer.  I dont like the taste of green tea.  Ginger-peach-black tea are the perfect sweet tea.  I add a very little stevia sugar.  I make the cold tea in the refrigerator and I drink it with stevia sugar.  I can't live without my favorite tea as The Republic of Ginger Peach Back Tea everyday.<br />B.
716	2	The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were  Exotic Floral and Berry  flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee.
717	5	If you're searching for a good, no sugar added blueberry for use in baking, mixing in a smoothie or with your yogurt, you can't go wrong with these.
718	5	There simply is nothing as good for an afternoon cup of coffee as this Yirgacheffe is.  Since my wife and I discovered coffee from Blacksmith Coffee Roastery, we've purchased no other brand.  The full flavor, the consistent quality, are unmatched.
719	4	Cheaper than the other meal replacement shakes without sacrificing too much flavor. I used to use the GNC lean shakes, but they got too costly.
720	4	With a 5 year old who has several food allergies, it is so had to find breakfast foods and treats that are like regular store items. He loves these tasty pastries and I love the fact that they are all natural and organic.<br />I highly recommend for all children.
721	4	I recently switched my dogs to this food because it won the taste test.  I got free samples of about 30 different foods, and this one was their favorite out of all of them!  Orijen and EVO came in as close seconds.  They love Alpha!  I can use it as treats for training, and they like it enough to work for it enthusiastically.  I do have a complaint that is is very low in calories, which means you feed more, which means it's more expensive.  But, my one dog is overweight, and is on a diet, so I decided a low calorie food may be good for him for a while.  My dogs have only been on it a week, but so far, they're pooping regularly and normally.
722	5	I'm not sure if I would pay $10 + shipping for these, since I bought them for $3 at the local convenience store in Waikiki--one box (14 pieces) between a few people could easily disappear within minutes. That being said, they taste great! The chocolate in the Mauna Loa equivalent is a little sweeter, but more comparable to Hershey's milk chocolate--I prefer these. Each piece contains about 2 macadamia nuts.
723	5	My cat loves this cat food! He likes the big chunks and if I mix it with another variety which is smaller nuggets he sifts through and pulls out the bigger oral care pieces. Another plus - my cat is 13 and has never had his teeth cleaned. The Vet believes the oral care chunks have been beneficial in keeping down the tartar on his teeth.
724	5	I also grew up on the east coast (USA), where this was, and may still be, readily available. We ate it on pancakes, ice cream, pumpkin pie..... Mom also used it in baking. None other matches the thick richness of this syrup, or the taste! Whenever I've gone back east, I've stocked up!
725	5	Living in Florida near the water resulted in lots of shrimp in the freezer last fall. We enjoy our fried shrimp lightly coated, and this cracker meal is one of the best. Tried store after store then looked on line and ordered a case from Amazon delivered right to my door. Shared some with my mother and stored the extra boxes in the freezer. Save gas,Shop on line!
726	5	BB Lamb and Rice keeps my two greyhounds in top shape.  My male is a very picky eater, and even turns up his nose at homemade chicken and rice, but he bolts this kibble down.  I add a couple of tablespoons of BB canned food with warm water to make a gravy on my greyhounds' kibbles, and they love it.  Greyhounds require very high protein feed in measured amounts or they don't thrive.  I've found this product to be excellent for them.
727	4	So, my dog likes it. I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides  Oh you want ALL of it!  and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better.
728	5	These beef jerky medallions are delicious. Have tried both teriyaki and peppered. (both great) Can't just eat one.  Great gift idea too!
729	4	My wife and I love Crystal Light and we drink some every day.  We like that they have a broad selection of flavors and you can switch around between them to keep yourself from getting tired of the same old taste.  We just recently purchased some of their new Mocktail flavors to try.<br /><br />This one is an Appletini flavor.  We don't drink Appletinis so we have nothing to compare it too but it is not bad.  My first impression was that the flavor was a little weak when compared to the other Crystal Light products.  We had just made the mix with cool water and had it with lunch.  The next day it was much colder out of the refrigerator and the flavor was much better.<br /><br />We like Crystal Light because it contains no sugar and caffeine which we both need to reduce in our diets.  This product does have 5 calories per 8 ounce serving but that is very low and not an issue for us. Each packet makes 2 quarts and each tube contains 5 packets.  That means this four pack will make 10 gallons of drink.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars as it is a good product but not necessarily my favorite flavor but, I would drink it again!
730	5	This vanilla makes all the difference in the flavoring of anything it dives into.  I would highly recommend it even if it sounds a bit pricey when compared to normal grocery store brands.  The vanilla taste is pungent and makes whatever you are adding it to even better than you could want.<br /><br />I was thrilled it came in the 32 oz. size bottle because with the pourer it is easy to use and there is enough I didn't feel I had to limit my use of it.<br /><br />This is the kind of product that once you've tried it you'll be unable to use any other brand again.  Fabulous results await if you'll give into the temptations of Madagascar!!!!
731	5	My son went to England and brought back this tea.  I fell in love with it and could not find it here in Florida.  Amazon!!! and the price was great and I just love my PG Tips Tea.
732	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MSS1X0 >Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Happy Birthday To You! Gourmet Food Gift Tower</a>I was very satisfied, the product arrived on time, even I placed the order just few days before my boyfriend's birthday. He said that the goodies were great!
733	2	LONG STORY SHORT: These cost too much, are not good for dipping, and suffer from the tiniest bit of humidity. Do not buy.<br /><br />THE WHOLE STORY:<br /><br />I was so excited when I saw these Rothchild Pretzel Dippers for sale. I was having a little get together with the swanky ladies down the block and I wanted to be certain that what I had to offer for our Book Club snack items were up to snuff. I ordered some Rothchild Red Pepper Dip <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045DO9QY >Red Pepper Dip</a>and got out my Mother's antique China snack plates and was all set to go. I even had matching crystal pieces, one for the Pretzels and a smaller one for the Red Pepper Dip. As suits the snooty lady image, our book of the month was SOUL BY SOUL: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674005392 >Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market</a>.<br /><br />Now, I am neither particularly swanky, snooty, nor snobby. I had moved into a new neighborhood and wanted to make a decent impression on the nice ladies that invited me to join their book club. I wore my Blue Jeans, a top with some  hip  sequins and my blue sandals. That's it. It's me, just me, and I will try to give you some good food, be polite, and see if we can all have a good time.<br /><br />So, I had various snack type foods available, a bit of wine, some Iced Tea with Peaches, a little Perrier for looks and off we went. It is a good thing the other ladies were QUITE POLITE because the Pretzel Dippers were a flop. They looked and tasted pretty much like the square Snyder's Pretzels that can be purchased at the local cut rate grocery store: a. The square snaps:<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3K8 >Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Snaps, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> or b.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XOYSTE >Snyder's of Hanover - Old Fashioned Dipping Stix Pretzels - 10-oz. Bag (Pack of 3)</a>. Actually, Snyder's dipping pretzels are the stick kind while Rothchild's resemble Snyder's little square ones with square holes in them.<br /><br />DRIPPERS INSTEAD OF DIPPERS: So, you can figure out right away, that Rothchild's Dipping Pretzels with holes allow all but the sturdiest of dip to drip or squish through the holes. My Snyders Red Pepper Dip had enough substance to it that the peppers DID stay on the pretzel, but the liquid that was associated with the Pepper Dip dripped right through. Good we had Mom's china to catch the drips. Paper plates would have inevitable become soggy. Thankfully, I had also made a Cream Cheese Based Dip and it DID stay on the Pretzels without any dripping. But, exactly what was the point? Making a sweet cream cheese dips that ends up being tried on Pretzels, instead of the intended bagel chips, was kind of a waste. So, I did not like these dippers because they would have been more appropriately labeled DRIPPERS.<br /><br />TASTE: The Rothchild taste was very Plain. Snyder's Pretzel taste, in my opinion, is much superior. I thought for the price that Rothschild might have thrown in a secret taste ingredient that made them worth the price. That was not so. Basically, they tasted like your usual prtzel with a little less salt.<br /><br />SOGGINESS: DID THEY STAND THE TEST OF TIME: I live in Arizona where the humidity is almost nil. Snyders Pretzels, The regular Rold Golds, and even those tubs of pretzels that the boss buys and sets out in the office hold up and stay fresh for 2 or 3 months with no problem. Not Rothschid Dippers. By day 5 after the party, these Rothchild Pretzels were starting to give, bend, and show signs of initial sogginess.<br /><br />MY SUGGESTION: Skip the Pricey Rothchild Pretzels. If it has to be Pretzels, you may as well go with the regular old Rold Golds. But, my real and truest suggestion, if dip is coming into play, Use Tostitos Scoops tortillia Chips. They are built for dipping and scooping and the nice ladies won't think you wasted your money on some high priced doo dad that is mostly for looks. Instead, they will think you are a smart, frugal little gal who fits right in with the crowd.  On the other hand, if you want it to look like you spent a bundle on a snack food with no redemptive taste, use as a dipper, or an item that makes it price worth the money, go ahead, buy the Rothchilds. I found them to be tasteless and a total waste of money. No recommendation from me!
734	2	I had this product for dinner one night- suffice to say that it looks and tastes very much like dog food. However, for the price, you get a meal that is edible and somewhat filling.
735	5	Im addicted to this on my rice. its great on anything bland and you wont have to add salt because it adds so much flavor. the taste isnt just hot but has a great depth and the sesame seeds add texture. cant have rice without it anymore.<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YGSJQ >House - Shichimi Togarashi 0.63 Oz.</a>
736	1	I think the person equates gluten with wheat. Gluten is also in other grains, especially rye. See [...] This product is a good whole grain food, however to call it Gluten free is just plain wrong (and I wonder if dangerous to those with celiac disease).
737	3	Catnip needs to be carefully cultivated (I read) so that other plants do not creep into the field.  Also, it must be fresh to really get the cat to respond.  My beloved cat did not react as I expected; truly effective catnip has a narcotic effect on susceptible cats, putting them in a spell almost.  My cat could take or leave this catnip unless it was really laid on heavily.
738	5	I had previously become addicted to the original Dave's Insanity Sauce after randomly coming across it in a nearby Target store. After becoming bored with all the other common sauces on the market I decided to give Mr. Dave's a shot. I instantly loved the burn that the original contained. I used it as a regular hot sauce, coating everything I could in the stuff. However, I became tolerant and wanted something more. Behold the Ultimate Insanity Sauce which I just had to order and received in the mail today. I have to say it was only slightly hotter than the original and was disappointed that it was not more. I still plan to use this as a sauce on burritos, chicken, salads, etc. On another note, it is not a MUST that you only use sparingly as some have mentioned. You just have to enjoy high heat sauces and have a tolerance for them. As for people including the unimportant  burns on the way out  comments...no one really cares to hear you speak of that. And for the record my stomach is used to it and it does not have said effect on me whatsoever. Bottom line great hot sauce for cooking or like me everyday use. Side note: I ate 2 tablespoons of original on You Tube and plan on doing this one as well. Search:  Dave's Insanity Bitch Slap  and enjoy.
739	1	This water tastes like sewage!!! Don't be hyped into buying it like I was. In going back and doing the research, there is nothing in this product that our bodies need except the water, which you can find in your kitchen. It looks horrible and tastes worse! If you feel you need to drink black/brown water, put some water in a glass, go out to your garden and dig up some dirt to add to it.
740	5	I originally bought a couple of these from babies-R-us for my 16month old daughter to have as a snack when we went to sea world. I figured it was healthy and something she can hold onto and feed herself, since ya know at this age they are getting oh so independent and want to do everything for themselves!! She loves them! We now buy them by the case from amazon because buying them individually from babies-r-us is just a little expensive, and here you get a pack of 12 for $17! Being a first time mom I have tried and failed with a lot of things for her snacks so now I actually taste everything that I give her and hey even I would eat these as a snack!!
741	5	We are loving this soup mix , I agree with the other reviewer in that you do need to add a bit more water than specified , especially if you like your soup to have broth or are adding other ingredients like fresh carrots or potatoes .  We only added salt , pepper the first time making it and used vegetable boulion cubes to flavor the water  and it was good with just those ingredients .  The next time we made it we used water and vegetable broth and added some onion , garlic powder , salt , pepper and after the soup mix cooked for about half an hour added some thinly sliced fresh carrots and Potatoes (you can also cook the carrots for about ten minutes before adding them to the soup if you like them really soft ) it was very good and the kids even asked for seconds ! This is a great mix to have around , you can add any thing you like to the soup mix or use it by itself and it is still taste great .
742	5	I was very pleased at how fast I received the Cat Man Doo bonito flakes since I am in a remote location.  My cat absolutely loves them.  I like the fact that they are fish and not a lot of carbs and fillers.
743	5	I put so much cream and sugar into my coffee that my friend likes to joke that I'm not so much into coffee as I'm into  coffee-flavored confections.  I was reading John Burdett's <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307474291 >Vulture Peak</a> and the main character talked about drinking  3-in-1.  Intrigued, I looked it up and found a couple of different brands, and decided on G7. I wasn't disappointed. The coffee is strong and there's just the right balance between coffee, lightener and sugar. It also makes a great iced coffee. The best part is how easy it is to make. Consider me a fan.
744	5	This is the best earl grey tea I have ever had and I am a real tea snob. It is smooth,heavy and has a great aroma.It feels like you have really had a cup of tea when you are finished. I was a Twinings only before this-this beats it hands down.
745	5	The Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K cups i ordered were full of delicious coffee.  So convenient to have my favorite flavor available to me in such a short time.  The price was a real deal as well.  Best value I've found so far.
746	5	As a mom of 2 teens one being a diabetic I am always looking for healthy low carb snack...I found it YUMMMMY these really are great and then next best thing to homemade!!
747	5	Our little Jack Russell came to us with a very sad tummy. Everything just came right back up. We tried rice and chicken - that seemed to make it worse. So we switched the protein and the carb by going to this food; and he has been eating and playing and getting in trouble just like he should be ever since - big or small size kibbles - he manages either just fine.
748	5	this is a must have if you like soy sauce or like to add salt on everything. the pack of 3 is great. comes out to about $6 a bottle & they are big. Highly recommend
749	5	I LOVE ALL MY COFFEE PURCHASE. I AM ALWAYS BUYING THEM AT AMAZON BECAUSE THE PRICE IS CHEAPER AND I CAN GET AWIDE VARIETY
750	5	I use this BBQ sauce on everything! Burgers, fries, you name it! I got it for a great price from Amazon as well, which combined with free shipping makes it an absolute no-brainer.
751	3	I ate these as a child and there were a lot more peanuts in them then. I still enjoy them but bet they's sell a lot more if they hadn't cheapened them up.
752	1	Every Walden Farms calorie-free product I tried was terrible, including this one. It's not just that it's not as good as  the real thing,  but it is truly AWFUL! Don't waste your money.
753	2	After the disaster that was the Rescue WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets, I decided to try the Victor Poison-Free M370 Yellow Jacket Magnet Disposable Bag Trap.  The swelling had receded from all of my newly acquired stings and I was ready for revenge.  This had trap had to work - I mean, how could it not?  There are pictures of yellow jackets trapped in the bag on the box!<br /><br />Oh how wrong I was.  I filled the bag with apple juice and bait and hung it on a tree next to my garage.  I sat in wait, watching the bag and waiting for the buzzing vermin circle the bag.  One even landed on top of the plastic rim.  It left, but not before it mocked me by doing a jig.<br /><br />I left the bag up for four weeks with no results.  When I went out to get it I noticed a wasp nest FIVE FEET AWAY!  Yup, this whole queen catcher line is complete garbage.  The nest was approximately 1/3 of the way built and not one stupid worker bee was floating in the bag!  Granted these were paper wasps and not a member of the subfamily Vespinae - yellow jackets, but the nest was already about the size of a softball!<br /><br />I was suddenly inspired and decided to use the bag to take care of the wasp problem.  I ripped the yellow plastic off and dumped the fluid.  I inverted the bag and wrapped it around my hand, like you do when you're picking up dog poop.  I grabbed the nest and quickly folded the bag around the top.  Perfect fit!  I shook the bag up and held it to my face to taunt the now enraged wasps.  How satisfying.  Then I tossed it in my trashcan and wandered off.<br /><br />Unfortunately wasps can actually live for more than an hour in a closed trashcan, as I discovered much to my horror when I tossed out the remains of the Rescue WHYTR-BB8 W-H-Y Trap for Wasps, Hornets and Yellow Jackets.  Oh boy were the wasps mad at me!  Now I know that I have a high immunity to both yellow jacket AND paper wasp stings.
754	5	Oh my these are good!  Really good!  I'm not fond of the trail mix with raisins and so I did some research and came across these.  Soooo glad I did.  They are Fabulous!  A perfect blend of almonds, honey roasted peanuts, sesame sticks, dark chocolate covered soy nuts (for that added sweet, but not too sweet....and soft as heaven!), walnuts and pecans.  Excellent, excellent product.  Already on subscribe and save.  The kids love them as do the parents.  Sure to please anyone.<br /><br />Highly Recommend!
755	5	My cat is very finicky.  He eats only what he wants to eat and nothing else.  He has, on occasion, practicably starved himself because he didn't like the brand or flavor of food that I bought.  A short time ago he broke his foot, and while he is all better now, the doctors recommended an herbal supplement on days where his arthritis has really bothered him.  Giving him this pill, however, has turned out to be more traumatic experience, if not making the pain even worse then before I gave it to him.  Popping it into the Pill Pockets makes for a much better solution.  He thinks he's getting a treat, and although the first few times he was unwary, he has grown to love the treats and never noticing a pill inside.  I would recommend this to all finicky cats everywhere.
756	5	These are exactly what I ordered! Yumma-lishish. At first I was irritated at how high the shipping was but then I shopped around and this place is actually the most reasonable shipping around, so don't I feel silly! It was just as ordered.
757	1	Note on my rating: the one star rating that I gave was for the poor marketing of this product, not on the quality or taste.  The folks at Puck could have done a much better job in naming this product something closer to what it is (a bag, not a  pod ), and amazon could have done a much better job separating this product from k-cup products, thereby saving me the cost and inconvenience of ordering this product by mistake.
758	1	Horrible after taste. I'm not sure what sugar they used but it ruined the product. Haven't found anything that tastes like starbucks yet but still searching.
759	4	Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, 3-Ounce Bags<br /><br />  I suffer from acid reflux and heartburn after eating and drinking certain foods.  I have always loved coffee but I just could not handle the heartburn and other stomach problems after drinking coffee. I was so excited to see this available because I would love to start drinking coffee again on a more regular basis.<br /><br />I have a 12 pot coffee maker and I only used 10 cups to brew for this pot of coffee and it was too potent for me. The aroma is wonderful but with 3ozs of coffee I needed to add more water. After adding additional water to the pot I found that it was drinkable for me. There is a mouthful of flavor in every sip with absolutely no aftertaste. No major coffee breath!<br />French roast has a naturally burnt/smokey taste to begin with and in this coffee you can really taste it. I just think I prefer a different roast type.<br />  As far as the low acidity I was really happy about not having to suffer after a cup or several cups of coffee. Since this coffee comes in different roasts and flavors, I would seriously consider buying it to alleviate the negative side effects from drinking regular coffee.
760	5	Popchips are great. I got the barbeque in the single serving, 100 calorie size.  It's the best way to get 100 calories I know of!  They were not broken or squashed in shipping either. Amazon is always careful about that. I'd buy them again.
761	5	This is a fantastic product! The price is great for organic rye flour -- it's at least twice as much in conventional grocery stores, if you can even find it. The packaging is great as well -- no worries about spilled flour or anything. And the flour itself is wonderful -- really delicious and fresh. I hope Amazon continues to carry this product; it's great to know I can buy 25 pounds of wonderful rye flour at a fantastic price and have it on my doorstep the next day.
762	5	I am recently new to the Keurig world.  I've tried a handful of flavors since I've gotten my machine, and have been just ok with most of the flavors tried.  Fog Chaser has restored my faith in my investment!  Try this!  Coffee shop taste and at a better price than Keurig K Cups!
763	5	i was a die hard Teavana fan until they discontinued (retired) several of my favorite teas<br />including Assam Gold Rain FTGFOP though i had some left i decided to give this a try and was<br />pleasantly surprised, it is full bodied w slight astringent qualities balanced by sweet notes at<br />the start w a nice malty finish.<br />i drink it straight up w raw sugar &/ or raw honey.<br />it is about the same price as Teavana's Assam was (if you buy it on Amazon) i will be buying more soon<br />my friends and family love it also by the way.
764	5	I have to say I am NOT particularly a fan of sweet potatoes but I love these chips.  These chips are unique and a great, healthier alternative to  standard  chips.  I will pack them in the kids lunches and take them to work as a snack.  So glad I took a chance and tried them.
765	5	Okay so for those of you hesitating thinking this is going to taste too much like something a staunch old man sitting in a ritzy Victorian library would drink, its not. Its also not like the stuff the teens would swill behind the bleachers in high school during winter football games. Wait, maybe that was just at my school. Anyway this stuff is GOOOOOD!<br /><br />Someone else said in their review it reminded them of Juicy Fruit gum and they totally hit the nail on the head with that assessment! Had this not been named  Brandy  I would have thought it was a fruit blend - not a punch like Hawaiian Punch, not even a tropical mixture, but just a really yummy sweet fruit blend of some kind. I really wish I could pick out specific fruit flavor elements to relate to you but I can't. Fruit Medley is all I can think of but there is a whipped cream like aspect to it, something that really makes you feel like you bit into some ripe juicy fruit (no pun intended) and it really does taste like that gum! This is one your kids would LOVE! Seriously if you want to get your kids or anyone in the family into matcha I would suggest this or the butterscotch matcha! Just make a latte with some milk, and some vanilla or sweet cream non dairy creamer! Add ice, stir LOVE!<br /><br />Now as for the Brandy aspect here. Its really not all that present to me. Yes I do get a SLIGHT and I mean SLIGHT alcohol effect - sort of a little twang or ting, but not really so much warming as brandy is known for.<br /><br />When I was younger, in my teens, I rode both western and equestrian, and trained horses. That was another life time ago. We would always have some brandy on us to keep warm in the winter wether out on the ranch repairing fences or preparing for a fox hunt (we did not really hunt the foxes I would have no part in that so don't worry) it was more of a Mock Hunt. LOL This matcha does bring back some fond memories of that but its not the same, and I doubt that you really could get the same result from anything but brandy itself but for all intents and purposes this is a very good flavor, a really nice experience, and one I will absolutely be ordering again! I know I say that about a lot of the matcha I have tried, and I have tried a lot of them but this along with about 5 others are THE matcha I can't be without! The  alcohol  effect is just enough for those who have had brandy to recognize but not so much that those who do not like brandy, have never had it, or should not have it, won't even notice. Its like being able to recognize any flavor, you kind of have to have experienced it before to know what it is. Without knowing what it is all you will notice is this AMAZING fruit festival in your mouth!
766	4	This was a great product, shipped quickly and was hassle free. I will consider buying this on a regular basis.
767	5	My dogs love them.  I wish they lasted longer because my dogs fly through treats.  But they do last longer than just a regular treat, but not as long as a chew bone.
768	5	I have been purchasing this German potato salad for years but my local store just stopped carrying it. so of course I looked to Amazon.  My mother, born in Germany, and now living alone, eats this probably a couple times per month. So glad I found it and will subscribe and save!
769	5	For Anybody who thinks there isnt a hot sauce  hot  enough .. THIS IF THE ONE!!! first of all the delivery on this want amazing ...in two days it came, and i live several states away from the shipping place. the smell, smells sweet. kinda but the taste, OMG! i used a tooth pick first to start it out. my tongue was burning up! and that was a tooth pick taste.second day i decided to take in a table spoon. ( dummest idea) out of my entire Life!!! there a point that you start to panic and dont know what to do... at that time, i got some of that sauce in my eye.. kinda melted my eye.. went to the doctor and yea wasnt pretty..... my left eye is smaller than my right!!!  surgery in a couple of weeks.. but that was my fault. wasnt careful.. daves hot sauce is number one on my list.. try it..just be careful to wash your hands after. you wont be disappointed!!!
770	5	Any dog puppy to senior and any breed dog loves these treats.  They go crazy over them!!!  They are healthy too.  I have been buying them for a few years now.  How I first found out about them is I read an article online about the oldest dog to live ate these treats.  So that made me want to buy them for the health of them.  So I do feel good about feeding healthy treats that dogs really like the taste of!!!
771	5	i found the packets at walmart for 57 cents i believe, but when i went back a week later they didn't have anymore! i also checked cvs and walgreens and they didn't have it either. i was so happy i found it on amazon and in cans which i think is a better deal than packets because you get more product. this is definately the best hot chocolate i've ever had. the peppermint isn't over powering like most peppermint hot chocolates i've had. i'll definately be buying more when i run out!
772	5	We used to have drive down to the specialty pet food store for this product.  So glad we discovered Amazon.  As far as I can tell it is no more expensive & in some cases less - Prime membership is awesome.  Loving Pets treats are some of the best according to my dog.  They do not develop that nasty smell like some dog treats do.
773	5	Always spread it on any cheese or try it with a Jacket Potato, Grated Cheese and then put the pickle on top..<br /><br />Luscious and chunky<br /><br />David<br />http://www.britishchap.com
774	1	Let me start by saying that, unlike many other reviewers, I have absolutely no idea what kind of oil is good or bad for hair.  I have, however, always used and liked coconut oil products and, when I saw that listed as one of the ingredients (along with shea butter), I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I was also interested in this product more for my dry ends rather than for my scalp.<br /><br />Now, I've read many of the other reviews where they refer to this as an  ethnic  hair product.  I read the product description and all the information on the product itself, and don't see that anywhere.  But, since it seems to be an issue, I am mixed race with very long, fine, wavy hair.  I use no  ethnic  hair products and never have.<br /><br />On to the product:<br />I decided to use a very small drop of the product strictly on the ends of my hair.  The drop was smaller than a dime.  I rubbed it onto my hands and then into my hair.<br /><br />The smell was not unpleasant and didn't linger very long in my hair.<br /><br />The oil was very greasy.  It coated my hands unpleasantly and left an unpleasant sheen in my hair.  I didn't like the way that it looked so, although the instructions didn't say to do so, I brushed it in.  That made it a bit better, however my hair still looked greasy and heavy.<br /><br />The plain fact is that, like anyone else, I like my hair to look clean. Instead of imparting a healthy shine, this product made my hair look greasy and unwashed.<br /><br />Simply put, I will not be using it again.
775	5	Our family drinks about two gallons of iced tea a day. Liptons gallon size bags make it easy to have iced tea on hand at all times. We put 3/4 cup of sugar into hot tap water add one tea bag and let it sit on the counter for a couple hours, remove the tea bag stir and refrigerate. So simple and so refreshing.
776	4	I still love Nutella, but at 21g of sugar a serving I was looking for something a bit more guiltless. I saw the small packs at Target and decided to give it a try. I'm always a little skeptical, and have tried other chocolate spreads but once I tasted this one I knew I had found it. I do miss the creamy texture of Nutella, but the flavor is spot on, although more nutty/hazelnut than Nutella. This is a compromise for my health where I don't feel like I'm missing out. I don't even mind that it has less sugar - it's still plenty sweet to satisfy me. I'll probably still buy Nutella from time to time, but I think Justin's will be my staple!
777	2	I went out on a limb and purchased this 50 pack of Jet Fuel because of so many good reviews.  Let me start by saying, I like STRONG coffee.  Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J
778	5	I use these treats for training my Maine Coon.  These are great for training because they are soft enough to break into small pieces and the cat can eat them quickly and await your next command.  You do need to keep them sealed and in the refrigerator after opening and use before the expiration date.
779	2	These coffee pods smell very strong when you first open them. however; preparing them as instructed (8 oz. water per pod) it comes out so translucent and weak. Maybe the company just has not gotten the coffee grounds to water ratio right yet. For now I would not recommend this purchase.
780	4	I bought these at Trader Joe's last Christmas (I like TJ's better than Amazon for real-time shopping since they have a tasting corner and they're definitely NOT virtual'.) It was an impulse buy, meant to be gifted. I tried one package and loved them; ate the other package, too -- please don't tell my relatives.  By the time I decided I had to have more the items were out of stock at both places.  Oh well, I placed it on my Wish List and will wait 'til next year or, maybe better, take a trip to Spain and get some there.
781	5	My family loves this product! Even my son who said he hates coconut now uses it on toast and to grill veggies. Smells like fresh coconut and tastes amazing! I recommend this product to everyone.
782	5	I'm not some fringe mustard snob. I like what i like. it seems odd to me to write a review of mustard, but this stuff has really earned it, and i was just so excited to see that it is now available on Amazon that i decided to clarify things for those who have not tried it. this  stuff is made with beer. in fact, the first ingredient on the label is  Beer.  they're not joking either; you can really taste it. this stuff is absolutely worth going out of your way to get for bratwurst, burgers, or pretty much anything. it's rather hard to find in grocery stores, even specialty food stores and high-end groceries, so having it online is very convenient. the point is, do yourself a favor and try this stuff on some grilled brats from the butcher. you will never eat another one without thinking about this mustard.
783	5	These jerky sticks are really good. They aren't fatty like most sticks and I really like the taste. I find I like these much better than typical beef jerky. The packaging and size are also great. I recommend these for anyone who likes jerky or is looking for a low-fat/high-protein snack-on-the-go.
784	5	These are my favorite variety from the KIND bars. If you are expecting a chewy and sweet (very sweet) bar that does not make you feel guilty, this is the right kind of bar for you! Additionally, the price on amazon is very good as they retail on other places for over 2 dollars a piece!
785	5	My 5 month old just started baby foods. He has tried a couple other brands of squash, but did not like them. I picked up SPROUT, and he ate the whole pouch! He loves them! I am now stocking up on other flavors!
786	5	The flavor of this tea is unmatchable. It is not carried in too many stores and why it isn't I don't know. I first brew it hot then make ice tea. No sugar is needed since the mango flavor give it a sugary taste.
787	1	I love Starbucks Coffee.  I made the mistake of ordering three bags of French Roast from CORELONE SALES CO.  My advise is to avoid this seller.  One of the bags looks as if it has been repacked.  Another bag may not contain the coffee I ordered.  CORELONE SALES CO. is dishonest and selling a coffee that may or may not be Starbucks Coffee.  Since it is in a language that I do not recognize, I cannot identify where the coffee has been packaged.<br /><br />I should not have purchased the product from this Vendor and I did so in order to save a dollar!  Big mistake and I urge Amazon customers to avoid doing business with this company.  They are not honest.<br /><br />I have learned my lesson and will only purchase Starbucks French Roast directly from Amazon Prime.  I urge everyone else to do the same otherwise they will be ripped off.
788	3	If you like strong coffee, this is the product for you. To me, it was a little too potent, but if you have a more European taste for coffee, you might find it to your liking. It has a heck of a kick (well, to me it did) and does the job if you need caffeine for medicinal (cough cough) purposes.<br /><br />The cans are a little on the small side, but I guess that's the point: Small and potent.<br /><br />As for the flavor, it's pretty good for strong coffee. I can't complain.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not sure I'd grab this again, but only because it's not to my personal liking. It's a well-made product that will appeal to some people, but not others.
789	3	...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.
790	2	I find the crisps dissolve in your mouth and aren't especially filling.  It's pretty tasty and an unbelievable 40 calories per pack.  But I think I'll stick to regular apples as more filling and tastier.
791	5	this is great!  cant tell the difference from original peanut better.  I have it with my fruit or on toast. Compared to the origanal calories of 45 vs 190 per serving..can't beat it.  Love this and will keep buying it.
792	5	It is close to the taste of fresh coffee. Moreover, it is cheap and convenient. I can have quick coffee every morning.
793	5	This product is terrific.  Delivered on time.  Will buy again.<br />Brings me back to my childhood.  This is one of the best comfort foods.
794	4	This product is great! I do not recommend sleeping overnight with this product. It smells horrible and will keep you up all night for the scent.
795	5	I love this brand of southern sweet tea.  It really has a great taste and is just sweet enough.  I am always happy with my purchase.
796	5	Brutus, my 3 year old pit bull, is such a heavy chewer he can destroy just about any toy in no time flat. The only toys that stand a chance with him are extreme Kongs, Nylabones, and the large size of the Premier Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone. (NOTE: There is a medium/large size, but it's 7 ; the large size is 9 , and that's preferable, IMO.) He loves chewing on the ends, he loves chewing on the big purple ball in the center, and he loves the gnawhide treats. And I love the fact that the toy lasts and lasts and lasts. Also, the fact that I can add in the gnawhide treats is a bonus because it seems to keep him more interested in the Bouncy Bone, compared to the Nylabones and/or Kongs.  With the Kongs, I can and do fill them with food and treats, and he'll play with them until the food is gone. But after that, he quickly loses interest. It's different with the Bouncy Bone; he'll keep on playing with it long after he finishes the gnawhide treats.<br /><br />Eventually, he was able to chew off one of the ends. But he now loves playing with the purple ball by itself, carrying it with him everywhere he goes. He likes it when I take it from his mouth and throw it in the house and/or backyard. He keeps bringing it back. And back. And....well, you get the picture. From now on, this is the only toy I'll ever get for him. He is a voracious eater, and is extremely motivated by food incentives. But he loves his Bouncy Bone even MORE than food, because instead of running straight to his food bowl in the morning, he runs right for his Bouncy Bone. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for heavy chewers!!!
797	5	This is one of my favorite products from Nueva Cocina.  This is some of the most authentic tasting Cuban food that can be prepared in under 30 minutes.  It tastes like it took hours to make, I can't believe someone was able to create this taste from a box. Very unique flavor.  I love this product!  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E433FQ >Nueva Cocina Black Beans & Rice, 8 Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a>
798	5	I just chop them in the food processor with some celery, add some Nayonaise and pepper, serve on a roll or bagel, and it's great! The only problem is that they are so good I keep eating them right out of the can while I'm making lunch!
799	2	Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed Snack Sweet. Not that good. Way Over Priced for what you get. Will not buy again.
800	5	First of all, my dog should write this review instead of me!  I feel hilarious and sad at the same time when watching him doing the job.  Ha, please let me know if you feel the same way.  At the end of this short video, do you see that my dog was cursing? or i think too much???? [...]
801	5	This is essential for a proper gumbo. Tried to buy it locally but could not find it. This was a simple way for getting the File'
802	4	This is a great tasting coffee.  It gets my day started off on the right foot.
803	3	I was expecting better. The broth is decent and the beans are pretty good, but the vegetables are too soft and overcooked and there's not enough of them. Progresso Minestrone low-sodium soup is much better, but it has egggs and milk which I can no longer eat since I'm vegan. By the way I contacted Amazon via email last week to remove the gluten-free description on this soup. I guess someone fell asleep at customer service because I never got a reply nor has the description been rectified. Like I said, I expected better.<br /><br />Addendum, October 19, 2012: Amazon finally acted on my request to remove the gluten-free description on the soup. The soup is no longer labeled as gluten-free. Thank you Amazon.
804	5	Hartz Crunch 'n Clean Biscuits are vet recommended.  The front of the box claims they remove 2 times more tartar than plain doggie biscuits and have a meaty flavor.  The small size seems to be just right for my two dogs (a pomeranian and a little terrier mix) and they absolutely love them!  There are only 35 calories per biscuit, so they make a good snack.  Directions state to give two daily.  Great product!
805	5	My daughter has tried nearly all the Ella, Sprout and Happy Baby varieties and this is one of her absolute favorites.  She especially loves it ice cold.  She is 8 mos old with 4 teeth and seems to prefer the texture of the Ellas as well as the stage 2 Sprout meals (not a huge fan yet of the stage 3 much chunkier Sprout meals but like the Happy Tot ones)Today, she was sucking one down on the go in the infant carrier and in trying to avoid getting it all over me, I licked off some extra and man, this has a pretty pronounced parsnip flavor (a little on the radish side but not spicy) carrot is easily tasted.  Not nearly as good as some other flavors I love and she doesnt seem one way or the other about but SHE LOVES IT!!! I wish they sold boxes of it on amazon, which is how I buy the Sprout meals.
806	5	We purchased Lyle's Golden Syrup in the tins.  It is hard and messy to get it out of the tins.  This will be easier since these are squirt bottles.  We enjoy making our own granola (recipe from The Homemade Pantry, yum) and the recipe calls for this syrup.  Much better than corn syrup. in my opinion.
807	5	Yes the coffee is good but why do you raise the price without letting anyone know??  I expect 1 price to be debited from my account and then the price goes up $5 without warning or notice!  Not Cool!
808	3	I have been searching everywhere for maple extract and was excited to find it on Amazon. I was disappointed that the taste was the same as the 3 different maple flavors that I have used in the past. There is a difference in the taste of a maple cake...which is still yummy....just not as rich in maple taste.
809	4	Kenco is a good cup of coffee. Would buy again. Its definitely a medium roast. Writing review to say its not a large cup as the package claims, thus 4 stars. It makes around 8 oz. Otherwise like I said a good smooth cup.
810	4	This gum is good if you like the black licorice taste.<br />It is also sugar free, so will not cause cavities like the other licorice gums that usually contain sugar.<br />I had to take away 1 star as the gum is not as long lasting as I'd like.<br />But I also like that it is mentioned where the gum is made-in Turkey....not in China at least!<br /><br />The price is also great!<br />I am also confused with the amount listed as when I bought it I called and was told you received 36 packages....so 3 boxes with 12 packages of gum in each.<br />Yes that is not a type-o it really was/is THIRTY SIX packages.<br /><br />But maybe call first just to c onfirm in any case if they do change the listing.<br />Another thing, before I forget the gum has absolutely no mint in it. It is only black licorice flavour.<br />-I've seen licorice and mint together in gum before though...
811	5	I have never made nut/seed milk before and so this is the first nut milk bag I've tried and I highly recommend this bag. It was super easy to make and clean afterwards. It's so exciting to be making my own milk and not have to buy anymore!
812	5	I am still actively working out my new diet since going gluten free, and these bars are a great addition. They're chewy, flavorful and full of natural ingredients like almonds and dried fruit. The almond & apricot and almond & coconut are the best flavors
813	5	I've liked this tea for a long time and was very pleased to find it in 6 packs on amazon. It has a very nice flavor, unlike many fruit teas that just smell like fruit and don't taste like much of anything. It's a very pleasant sort of sweet and tart taste. I don't put sugar or anything in it. Also, when brewed, it's a deep raspberry pink color and smells wonderful! I would highly recommend this if you enjoy fruit and/or berry herbal teas!
814	5	This tea is the reason why I bought a Keurig. It's my absolute favorite. I make a cup each morning to take with me to work (anyone who works a 9-5 needs a pick me up!). I usually re-order two boxes every couple of months, and my package always arrives quickly. I'll be buying these k-cups as long as they're available!
815	5	I love brewing this tea. You can make it complex or pretty simple during your preparation of it. Although it doesn't say that the tea is Fukamushi on Amazons web page it does say it on the packaging of the product. This is consistently the best green tea I purchase.
816	5	These chips are a regular in my house now.  In fact they are the only chips I buy.  The BBQ flavor is my favorite.  I buy these in single serving packs because if I buy a bigger bag, it is too hard to stop eating them.
817	1	Please don't buy this product because it does not work. The glue is very weak and the moths just fly in and out of the trap.
818	5	(ASIN: B004LWGLQ0)  Cottie is a little cat, approximately 10-12 pounds of love.  I buy 1-2# bags of food so he gets a balance of those foods he refuses to eat in canned form.  With the smaller size, I also keep him from being bored with his diet, which I understand can be a problem for cats.  The larger bags are more economical, but they would hang around for too long, and he would tire of eating what's in them.<br />This is the latest newbie; they are all kept together in one of these huge storage bins with a top that secures very well to the bottom, keeping food fresh and bugs out.<br />I have taken to writing a note for each bag, stating the dates he was fed and what went in bowl #2 (there is no bowl #3, for those of you old enough to recall daytime TV of old.)  The only other thing I could add to this recommendation would be if I were to observe him eating it, and make yet another note of the date he finished the portion.  And do the same for a couple of other foods for comparison purposes.
819	5	This is a great sugar, it's very clean, tasty without being over  sugary , I really enjoy it in or on anything requiring sugar, and knowing it's organic makes me feel better in many aspects, it's a little more costly than regular sugar, but again don't we as a nation abuse sugar a little too much !? So knowing it cost more makes me use less, and at the end the benefits go directly to a better health for both human & planet Earth.
820	3	Same Price at Kroger, but you get the benefit of receiving 10 cents off per gallon for gas.  Just be sure to check around...changes all the time.
821	2	I received 2 black bags, 2 green bags and 2 dark (almost black) purple bags.  Not the bright colors pictured here. These bags are very thin.
822	5	My husband and I are coffee and tea freaks!  We'll try just about anything once.  I really like this tea, even if it's not Christmas.  Very smooth, the mint finish is very nice.  The ginger note is subdued, and not overpowering as I thought it might be.  Well worth trying at least once.
823	3	I wanted to get this food because the price is more reasonable as compared to my cat's normal food, Science Diet Indoor Formula. I bought a small bag to try it out, and I'm glad I did, because I'm not buying it again for the fact that it makes my cat's poo ridiculously smelly! Even though I clean the litterbox near daily, wipe it down with cleaning wipes, use sanitizing spray on it, and have an air purifier clsoe to it, I can STILL smell when he has gone to the bathroom. The cleaning combination was effective when he was on Science Diet.<br /><br />If it doesn't make your cat's poop smell something fierce, then this is a great deal. The product has good, all natural ingredients, and is inexpensive compared to the other brands.
824	5	My dog doesn't like most treats, but loves these.  She gives them 4 paws up!<br /><br />The product arrived quickly and saved me a half-hour drive to a pet store.
825	2	While I like the idea of these wraps, the rosemary garlic w/herb flavor was overwhelming.  We tried making a variety of wraps w/different cheese and meats, but the wrap favor was so intense, you couldn't really taste anything else. The whole family tried them and we all had the same opinion.  Now I'm stuck w/a freezer full of them and can't figure out what to do with them.
826	2	I make gluten-free bread and had been using xanthan gum as a binder, but I thought that I could substitute the guar gum, which is cheaper.  My bread was falling apart when I attempted to pick it up.  The bread left a slimy film on my tongue, and it was making me cough.<br /><br />I wanted to buy less, but the 3 bag purchase was not available.  Now I have almost eight full bags of guar gum that I need to find a use for.
827	5	My Pom Gidget is absolutely addicted to these. She HAS to have a piece of one of these EVERY NIGHT! I break them in quarters,  she's a small dog so a full size cookie is too big. Your dog will love you longtime for giving them this treat!!
828	5	With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!
829	5	I tried this after the coffee people donut shop kcup doubled in price.  This is very good and far more reasonably priced.  Go for it!
830	5	This is the diet killer. The King Size version of this candy packs a whopping 440 calories and 10 grams of saturated fat. You heard right, half your suggested daily serving of saturated fat in four little wafer bars. But oh, are they so good. These are my guilty obsession.<br /><br />If you've never had them, the ReeseSticks have very little in the way of chocolate - just a thin coating over the wafers. Multiple layers of wafers are sandwiched together by the Reeses peanut butter'esque filling, so the first taste impression you get is peanuts, then an overtone of general  sweet . Personally I like this bar because it's not overly sweet like a Snickers or Mars, but don't kid yourself into thinking that the peanut butter aspect somehow makes this bar healthier than its super-sugary compatriots... it doesn't.<br /><br />...so good.
831	5	We use this on our Jura Capresso machine, it is by far the best coffee we have drank. No bitterness, great flavor, can be drank with no cream or sugar if needed.
832	5	Believe it or not, I don't really like chips, I don't dislike them, but if I see them at a party, I usually won't have any, I prefer pretzels.  I thought that I would give these a try anyways.  They are really good.  Very light, not greasy at all.  I don't like sweet potatoes, but I like the flavor in these chips.  I would encourage all of you and my friends to give them a try.  You'll like em.
833	3	This product comes with very easy to follow instructions to get started and one day after I planted the seeds, I was able to see some grass. The base is quite cute.<br />I was amazed at the speed the grass grew, 5 days later it was fully grown. My two cats loved it, they enjoyed the 4 grass varieties. It was a great treat for them.<br />The big problem was that after one week the plant died. I did everything possible to keep it alive Water/Sun/Shade(there are no instructions for maintenance)<br />The whole process from the day I got it until the day the grass was dead and dry was around week and a half.<br />I though it was going to last longer.
834	5	My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it.
835	5	I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan  all the time , then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.
836	3	These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Each can has 140 calories, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbohydrates, 35g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C. This sparkling juice tasted good as you drank it and I could taste the Strawberry and Watermelon blend. After trying three flavors I would have to say I would drink this again, though I prefer  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40 >The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> flavor.
837	5	This bottle, or more appropriately, This Chalice, contains the true blood of the creator.  This bottle is culinary mescaline. It is a life changing sauce of the gods.  I pour nickle size blops on the back of my hand and slurp them off.  Maybe I should rephrase that. Nah... I mean it, if you are even slightly spice friendly, get this. Some hipster dope will tell you that this is not  real  or  authentic  sriracha. You tell that ironic fixie riding trustafarian to go to hell.  This is better.  This is some next level chit, mang. Its not an abusive hot, you can really taste peppers, and garlic, Its not a macho,  blew out my o-ring  hot, but it gets the endorphins flowing, elevates your conscience and we become one with the universe. No, really, I like it. It is good.
838	5	This product is getting hard to find and I was so happy that Amazon found it for me.  It is the only product that doesn't come right back up from my fussy felines.  I have been using it for the last three years and am so happy to have been able to locate it on Amazon.
839	5	PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)
840	4	I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product.
841	5	Quality product at the right price. I've been part of the subscribe & save program for this organic maple syrup for over a year now. It's an expensive syrup, but very mineral-rich and we use it sparingly--so it works for our family.
842	5	Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.<br /><br />This tea has an unmistakeably smokey note, which for years made it a particular favorite with the  single malt and cigars  crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.<br /><br />Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it.
843	1	Two 3 oz packets of pectin should be about four bucks.  I hope this is a case price but nothing in the information says otherwise.
844	5	I have used Canidae products exclusively for my dogs for many years, with great results. They have healthy shiny coats, and are active and beautiful. However, my Sheltie-Chow mix had recurring ear problems all her life. The vet couldn't identify the problem--her ears weren't infected--but they always looked red and irritated. We tried everything, but nothing really helped. One day, on a whim, I bought the new grain-free Canidae, and to my surprise her ears cleared up almost immediately. All the time we had been looking for an elusive infection, but apparently she just had a wheat allergy. To test the theory, one day I fed her a piece of bread (wheat) and the next day she was tugging at her ears. Back to the grain free Canidae! The dogs love it, and the Sheltie mix just passed her 15th birthday and is going strong.
845	5	The label on  Frank's Hot Sauce says  The Perfect Blend of Flavor and Heat  and I must say this is an accurate description of the product.<br /><br />Frank's Hot Sauce is outstanding.  It's a Cheyenne Pepper based hot sauce that is not too hot, not too sweet, but has just a perfect blend of  flavor and heat.   It's not like Tobasco sauce which is very hot and you sprinkle on items.  It's a different kind of sauce (I love Tobasco).  Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices.<br /><br />I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hot sauce.
846	5	This is the best hot chocolate ever!<br /><br />It's made for the industrial hot chocolate machines, but if you take about 3 tsp's per one cup of hot water, it's chocolatey goodness goes down nice and smooth.
847	5	I give my Lab, Maggie, and my Golden Retriever, Dallas, one of these every night around 9pm when my husband and I have a treat! They not only look forward to it but I swear, they tell time by it! It's a healthy treat. Having Amazon deliver them to my house is nice too because sometimes my grocer runs out of them.
848	3	The cookies are delicious and have purchased them in the past.  This time, however, they arrived with half of the cookies as crumbs.  In addition, one section only had two cookies and not three.  Very disappointed this time and am not sure I will order them again.
849	5	I bought this collection for a friend for Christmas. He LOVED it - I think he tasted every one and passed out tastes right then and there. The rack is nice - not fancy, but nice. The test tubes are generously sized and can be re-used when the salt is gone. A great and novel gift for the right person.
850	5	I just ordered this, came today and thought I would just try it, well to my amazement,My little Daisy ate it and wanted more.My little Dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with Flare-ups with her pancreas, I have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber. I have been making her dog food ,but she missed eating the dry,I wondered if it was small enough for her to chew , but it was.
851	4	Still in process of narrowing down my personal preferences. Medium strong which is a good thing, but I get an aftertaste that I'm not crazy about - might be me.
852	5	I did some research on natural ways to help arthritis, and I got reviews about cherry juice. So I ordered this juice. It has helped so much. I might sound like a crazy but I have only had it for a week, but was drinking 40oz of water a day with the cherry juice.  I missed a day and about 5pm I was in so much pain. I laughed and told my husband I needed my juice. I did drink the juice but had to take 3 Advils to help...  Well I have not miss a day and don't need Advil everyday anymore...
853	5	Works just as good an original that came with trap. This product is great for keeping a watch out for fleas. If you have a pest co. you can just show them the trap and say look I still have fleas.  If this is the only light on at night and if you have a flea in the house it will be on this trap in the morning.
854	5	When my toy poodle finishes her dog food-she comes to me and barks and barks for her treat, GREENIES.She will not stop barking till she gets it.  I make sure she has eaten her dog food then she gets her GREENIE. It is the highlight of her day,and she is the happiest dog. Her teeth are very white and she has the sweetest smelling breath.I make sure I am never out of GREENIES.The price is the greatest too.Thank you.D>D>
855	5	Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.
856	5	It's so great to be able to get this coffee delivered right to my door!  Amazon prices for K-cups are so much better than they are in the local stores.  K-cups cost more than brewed coffee but they are so worth it!
857	4	I think this is a great product, low in sodium add just the right flavor for the Bacon lover..A Natural taste, not overdone.
858	5	What can you say about granola? If you like granola, and you want it to be additive free, this is for you. Kind Blueberry clusters with Flax seeds has whole grains such as amaranth, quinoa, oats, milet and buckwheat. It also has apple, blueberry and plum puree that act like raisins,you get an occasional lump of one to add to the taste. There is no refined sugar since the cereal is sweetened with apple juice. To me it tastes like granola that is not too sweet and has a flax seed kick (watch out, they can get stuck in your teeth). The serving is 1/3 a cup (kind of skimpy if you ask me). Another reviewer mentioned it was too crunchy and sweet. Considering granola is crunchy, that shouldn't be a surprise and this is about as sweet as unsweetened applesauce. To me baklava is too sweet. This granola, not even even close.<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of the nutrient values.<br /><br />Calories 120<br />Fat 3g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 20mg<br />Total Carb 22g<br />Fiber 5g<br />Sugars 5g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />You aren't going to get more  No ____ Added  than this. No gluten, no refined sugar, no GMO (whatever that is), no trans fat, no cholesterol, no dyes, no chemicals. The clusters are tasty and its got a nice amount of fiber. Here's to your health.
859	5	Glad I bought to try for them!  And cheaper here (if it's on sale) than at my local stores!
860	5	I started buying these last year for my boys to take for snack time at school.  They were complaining about being hungry after most snacks.  These fill them up until lunch and they love them!
861	3	Kind Healthy Grains never calls itself a cereal, which is probably a good thing. While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.  They come with most of the nutrition benefits but neither of the drawbacks that I outlined above.  We'll be sticking with them instead.
862	5	I have been feeding Innova Small Bites to my 2 Papillons for over two years now. They both love it. One is 4 years the other 10. At first I thought I might be starting the younger out a little soon on an adult food but he has done great on it. When you look at the Innova brand the ingredients are pretty similar. They fill up on less food. Their stools are small and firm. Most importantly they have never been to the vet except for shots ! Even if it costs a little more it saves you money in the long run !<br />You really do get what you pay for in dog food. Organic, as possible, is the way to go.<br />Now that my little girl is getting older and not running around as much I have incorporated some Innova Low Fat into their mix and that hasn't bothered either of them at all ! The kibble is a little bigger ( maybe twice ) but that is still very small and easy for small dogs to eat.<br />I have to be creative because these two are going to eat only what the other does ! So I not only have to please a 4 & 10 year old but make a diet that is healthy for both !<br />Innova makes that easier than most products on the market !
863	3	But my daughter is and she said 'well it's not great, but it's coffee in a can so what can you expect'.  I took a sip and it's really a meh! product...not as bad as it could be but also not as good as it could be either.
864	5	This spice is great. We love this and use it all the time. I did not buy this at Amazon but actually purchased it at a very large well-known Asian Market in the International District in Seattle for less than $3.00.
865	5	I like this almond flour very much.  It is a good price and tastes great.  I appreciate the texture<br />of almond flour.
866	5	Well, its Monday and six a.m., time for the morning coffee. Down to the kitchen, fill the senseo coffee maker and then open the senseo coffee pack. What a wonderful aroma. Two pods in and two on standby.<br />The first cup of medium roast is not biitter nor clogs the senses. Since I drink it unadorned, there's just the right amount of roasted taste. No expresso for this person at this hour of the morning.<br />Douwe Egberts medium roast is the perfect median for morning coffee. Further, each day the taste remains the same.<br />Later that morning on to the second cup. Again perfect coffee taste, plus no acidity. Cannot say enough about the entire senseo coffee system. Please try.
867	5	Love this stuff.  It has one of the best combinations of chocolate and mexican spice flavors of any I have tried.  I used to live near a bookstore where the cafe made mochas with this cocoa and now I buy it at home for the same purpose.  It also works really well to add a little spice to your cookies.
868	5	I normally prefer Starbucks pumpkin lattes to Dunkin donuts' but these kcups are amazing!  Won't have to make my daily Starbucks visit!
869	4	I use this in my protein shake, with chocolate protein powder, almond milk, and SF banana syrup.  It helps keep the calories reasonable, with the protein and flavor high.  The first time I bought the small/regular size jar, and the next time the larger bag. I will keep buying this.
870	5	Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil is the finest quality coconut oil. The flavor is wonderful. I use it as cooking oil, as an ingredient in many dishes, on toast, and even to moisturize my skin. This is an essential product and the 54 ounce jar from amazon.com is a great value.
871	4	This is by far the best doggy toy I have ever bought.  I wish it was a little harder to get the food out.  My dog Bailey is a master at pulling the rope stopper in and out to get out the little bits.  I tried putting in bigger dog treats, but they are too big.  Smaller dog food slides out pretty easily if Bailey gives the jar a whack.  He can get all the food out in under 15 minutes.  I need a puzzle toy that is more difficult so he can be distracted for hours.  If the puzzle toy is too difficult, he usually just gives up.<br /><br />But it's an awesome toy because it makes your dog think a lot and keeps them distracted, because lord knows that if puppies aren't distracted, they are going to want to play with you!
872	5	This product is great, the kitties love them and they were a great price compared to other sites.  It was a great deal and it arrived very quickly.
873	5	My puppy just loves these, he just attacks these when he gets them<br />Has essential vitamins and other nutrients your growing puppy needs
874	5	My wife and I love this as a morning tea and have been drinking it for years. I saw it on Amazon and the price was OK.<br /><br />Problem is I was charged $10 for shipping. The 2 100 bag boxes only came to $10 so shipping doubled the price.<br /><br />We will continue to drink this but we won't buy it from Amazon again!
875	5	My cocker spaniel loves these. They are cheaper on here through subscribe and save than anywhere else, even with coupons in stores. If I need to keep the dog busy, he gets one and it does the trick! He's three and still very puppy like.
876	4	I mean to give this product four stars, though the interface is giving me a little trouble. I'm very fond of it. I can't have bacon in my household, and this sausage, while not replicating the texture of bacon, does suggest that smoky savory flavor when sliced thin and fried or microwaved to crispness, far better than that nasty turkey bacon does. Also, it's tasty in its own right.
877	2	I didn't like this product.  It tastes like strongly-flavored puffed rice covered in chocolate and my first impression was  chocolate covered popcorn .  Mine was so melted it was soup and I had to put in the freezer to make it edible.  The melting and refreezing made it waxy and a somewhat unpleasant, unrecognizable mound of candy with which I had to literally peel the wrapper off.  My rating here is for the taste and texture only although it may or may not have tasted better if not ruined.<br /><br />*Also beware of ordering this if you live in a warm climate.  I don't enjoy receiving melted chocolate and had no other problems with any other chocolate melting that I ordered from other sources that month.  I'll assume it was the product ingredients making it susceptible to melting easily so it should have had special warm-weather wrapping when this is a problem.  Even though the vendor shipped more quickly than usual the product was ruined.  Many chocolate companies won't even sell their products during the warm months unless they can adjust to this problem and neither should this one. No refund or partial refund was even offered by the seller (O.E.I.) yet I was hounded constantly by them about my  seller review  per half a dozen telephone calls. I eventually deleted the seller review for reasons I'll not explain further. In my opinion, this is an over-priced waste of money.
878	5	These are really excellent. Perfect meal replacement, or after-workout nutrition. I have one every day. After trying a zillion nutrition bars, these are the best in class.
879	4	Worth the price and the smile you get from that special coffee drinker in your life.
880	3	Our dogs wouldn't eat this food unless we put wet canned food<br />mixed in with it, although a stray neighborhood dog would.
881	5	This product is fantastic.  Instead of popcorn we eat pork rinds.  They have no carbs which have helped us to keep our weight down.  We feel we have made a better choice.  We eat them practically every night.  Thanks for a great product.
882	5	It really does taste just like water!!! :) I personally don't taste the mineral taste others have claimed they can taste- I would suggest drinking it cold!
883	1	The first ingredient is coconut, I should have known better than to order this! It has very little carrot taste at all and leaves a bizarre after taste that I couldn't cover up no matter what  faux frostin  I crafted to go on top. Not worth the money
884	5	This tea is hard to find so I bought 6 boxes. When you open the packet, the bag smells exactly like fresh peaches. The taste is not masked by other flavors such as cinnamon. It makes wonderful iced tea.
885	5	Of all the K-Cups we have tried, and that's a bunch, this one is the hands down favorite for flavor and boldness.  This is the one the spoon stands up in, the jolt that brings you to life no matter what.  This is always our go to for strength and good flavor.<br /><br />This is certainly our favorite from Green Mountain!
886	5	I had these when in the Phillippines and then when I came had to have some more.  Even though this a large bag we go through these fast in about two weeks.
887	3	My roommate and I tried this one because she really likes the Kona Island blend from Coffee People. The first time we tried it was this morning and we brewed the largest size (travel mug sized). It was extremely weak and the coconut flavor was really strong.<br /><br />We brewed another generic kcup in the smallest cup size and mixed it then split it into two cups for each of us. It was a great cup of coffee, but it was a DYI process.<br /><br />Brew in the small size and then brace yourself for the taste of a melted coconut snowcone in your coffee.<br /><br />I will be honest that I do like it and I am glad we have it, but if you are in great need of coffee and you like something strong, go with something else.
888	5	Somersaults are a terrific snack...addictive really.  Healthier than most snacks and very convenient packaging.  Be warned you will want more.
889	5	Wasabi!  Almonds!  What's not to love?  Can't stop eating these, glad they come in packs of six...
890	5	I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again.
891	4	This is a great snack bar.  But don't expect normal chocolate taste.  It's different.  Not horrible, but different.  After the first bite and you kinda adjust it's fine.  I think the vanilla one is a little more of a real taste.  But the bar itself is great- I love the low sugar- definitely the best low sugar chocolate protein bar I have tasted.
892	5	i haven't actually received this in the mail yet but I'm reviewing this early because for a while dried ghost peppers were not available on amazon.com (probably temporarily out of stock at one time).  i am doing this review early to show my appreciation for having this available. as it says in the title of my review  i love insanely spicy things .  Sense you Chinkendinner seem to be one of the only providers of this item i can definitely say as long as its available i can definitely say that once i run out of dried ghost peppers i will definitely buy more from you.<br /><br />thanks a bunch
893	5	These cookies come in different sizes. If you want a small treat look for the smaller size. I have a big 120 lb GSD and these are just right for him. I found this flavor helped settle his upset tummy too. Since I changed to grain free food (Taste Of The Wild Dry Pacific Stream) we haven't had the stomach issues anymore. However, these did help on those days where I would see him eating grass like a hungry cow.
894	5	This tea was very good. I was Very happy I got it. A tea that is so good for you and will help many things in your body. My breathing felt better after the first cup. I will be buying more again soon. Doug in Calif...
895	5	These things rock! All three of my kids, all under 9, love these snacks they do not even realize that they are the same thing they cry about eating at dinner time. They would never ask to snack on snap peas if it were not for this product, now if only they create green beans and lima beans!!!!
896	3	The coffee is good but I think that the creme brulee flavor is lacking....
897	3	This  water  has a very, very light coconut flavor with a hint of sweetness. It is refreshing and doesn't leave an aftertaste like drinks with sugar. I like the fact that it has electrolytes, but they are really unnecessary for most people, in light of the fact that it takes a huge amount of exercise (like running a marathon) before one needs anything other than water to rehydrate. What I don't like is the number of calories, admittedly fewer than, say, an equal amount of soda or juice, but still more than I care to consume in a drink - and the price. I just can't see myself paying two bucks for a 12 oz. container when a glass of water from the tap (or just about any other drink I could choose) is much less. Or free!
898	4	I have been buying these for about a year now for my daughter.<br />These are a great on the go snack that anyonecan feel good about serving up.<br />It is neat and resealable.<br />She can use this all by herself and it helps her learn how to eat, we can keep these anywhere and no longer need a jar and spoon so saves space.
899	5	Haven't found a decaf I like better.  Took forever to get it though. very very slow shipping. Still, I'd buy it again. The coffee is worth it.
900	5	Our family loves brownies and these are great. Not only are they healthier for you they taste good. We like to add nuts to them. I was making them with yogurt but have switches to unsweetened applesauce. just a little tip. They are hard to cut so we tried making them in a muffin pan it works great. you get 12 individual brownies. Just grease the pan add the batter then bake for 22 to 23 minutes. about 2 minutes after taking them out of the oven get a fork and gently nudge one corner to get them out of the pan, do this to each one.then let them cool. works great. I like mine moist so I put them in an airtight container while they are not totally cooled. Enjoy these great brownies!!!!
901	5	You know how picky a toddler can be, my daughter (18months old) love this, it is the only breakfast she likes with her milk. We try all the different types but the one with Peach is her favorite.
902	5	MAde by the great brand that does adult snacks now for kids. all natural and organic. have great flavor and are good for you. my kids love them and I have ate a few myself. definately worth the price when u compare it to the cheaper not good for them fruit snacks.
903	5	Outstanding flavor without the bitterness.  Great any time of the day or night.  Can't tell if it's decaf or not.  Wife fools me sometimes and gives me the decaf even when I ask for a cafiene boost.  Great coffee!  Thanks Green Mountain for a wonderful coffee without the American bitterness.  About time someone made a great American coffee to match up to the Italian and French roasts.  Not quite as strong, but almost equally as flavorful.(almost) LOL!
904	5	Not only is this particular configuration a great deal (versus the 5 or 10 flavor options), the product was well-packaged and arrived very quickly.  The flavoring oils are quite strong and smell/taste wonderful. For some of them, I need only one drop to flavor my entire 12oz smoothie, other flavors need a few drops, but it's still phenomenal to have such a palette at my command. I'm looking forward to mixing banana cream with a tiny bit of black walnut for a  banana bread  protein smoothie.  I also bought flavors to play with my soda stream carbonator; zero calorie sarsaparilla will be mine!<br /><br />While plenty of candy recipes call for using the entire contents of these little bottles, I'm using them for single drop applications (drinks, mostly), so portion control is a little trickier.  I opted to get tiny plastic droppers, like these: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084XWJYK >Cosmos ® 0.2 ml Plastic Transfer Pipette, Pack of 100 + Cosmos Cable Tie</a> so not only am I able to perfectly control how much flavoring I'm using, I also get to feel like a mad scientist in my kitchen.
905	5	I had been drinking other mineral waters so far and I did not know how the taste of the mineral water is different from each other until I tried this water. Now I am really satisfied with the pure and good taste of this water and I will keep drinking the water. I would like to recommend this strongly.
906	5	Ok, to be fair LadyBug likes anything edible.  :)  Which was part of the problem....  Lady is a older (11-14 yr.) std. American Eskimo who loves to  eat that I inherited from my Grandmother.  She got up to 42 lbs on her previous diet dog food and the vet wants her to be 35.  That means she was overweight by 20%  &lt;cringe>.  So I discovered this food and after &lt;6 months, she is 36 lbs.  She likes the food and once she adjusted to the smaller quantity of food, found it to be quite filling.  Our Bear (6 yr. Great Pyrenees / Border Collie mix) sometimes steals Lady's food instead of eating her own.  I'll probably move Bear over to this dog food next year.  I should probably note that as old as Lady is, she acts like a young dog...  even though she is losing her sight slowly.
907	5	Polenta is generally not a week-day meal, if made the old fashioned way.  However, quick-cooking polenta opens up that possibility.  This particular version cooks in only 1 minute.  I was pleased with the results, as was my husband.  It is a fair amount of polenta to buy at once (12 boxes), but should last until we manage to eat all of it.
908	5	theses cookies are good , oatmeal seems to be my favorite and best of all you would never know they were sugar free if the label didnt say it. i will purchase this product again ,they're that good!
909	5	The nuts are the best if you like spicey!!! I have ordered them several times... and will order again... awesome!
910	5	I was looking for a product to combat dehydration following my husbands surgery. Gatorade just wasn't good enough. This product came highly recommended so I thought I would try it. It has really helped keep my husband hydrated as well as tasting good without being too sweet. Very economical to use when compared to prepackaged similar products.
911	5	My experiment was a success!<br /><br />I ate like a pig and took two Benecol chews a day and ate oatmeal intermittently. Unlike my experiment with Colest Off I made no  attempt to be a vegetarian. The results were still promising and show that the Benecol Chews are a potent force in lowering Total Cholesterol.<br /><br />My Total Cholesterol with no supplements and no diet change is a scary 287, with Colest Off and a partial vegetarian diet my total cholesterol  is about 197 with a good ratio of HDL to LDL. The Benecol Chews reduced my total to an unimpressive 237, but considering that I ate high cholesterol foods this shows the potency of plant STANOLs.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CD0W8U >CholestOff 240 cplts</a>
912	1	I should have noticed  mastic flavor;   not mastic.  It's nothing but sugar and glucose, with a bit of mastic flavoring.
913	5	Delightfully surprised!  Got the sampler pack and was least intrigued by the hazelnut, because though I love Ferrero Rocher and Nutella and the filberts, coffee flavoring in the past has fallen quite short.  O -- M -- G !!!!!  This is SOOO good.  Tastes just like a Ferrero Rocher candy -- and NO CALORIES!!!  I drink my morning coffee black brewed at home, and like to keep the Splenda packets around in case I go for an extra cup of the work brewed rock gut.  So convenient to carry packets in my purse also, if brews are not so tasty when traveling.  My least desired of the 5 pack has now become my favorite.
914	5	I first used this product while cooking in a Swiss cuisine restaurant.  It was used to season Wienerschnitzel.  It is great on any meat, especially hamburgers.  Don't make the mistake of limiting its uses though, because it makes frech fries awesome!  My kids love to taste it staight out of the container.  This one is very hard to find in the supermarket.  Amazon saves my life once again by offering products that the local grocer won't.
915	5	This is an excellent morning tea, as clean tasting and robust as a good English breakfast blend should be.  I have enjoyed tea all over the world for years, and this is a blend I look forward to each morning.
916	1	This concentrate tasted nothing like chai tea should. I prepared exactly according to the instructions on the box, but even so all I could taste in the tea was a strong, pepper-ish overtone that completely blocked any hints of the other spices. It was undrinkable. After several attempts at brewing it differently, I ended up throwing it out.
917	2	My puppy loved this but it only lasted a few days, isn't this supposed to be a  chew toy ?.. well it DOES NOT hold up for chewing, don't waste you're money. Check out the product called  goughnuts  my pup loves to chew on it and has not been able to destroy it so far.
918	5	As an aid to tranquility and sleep -- what it is marketed for -- it is not very effective.  But for chronic severe constipation it is the only thing that has worked for me.
919	5	Fantastic Find! With preschool just around the corner, I'm always on the hunt for fun, tasty, healthy and organic snacks for my three year old!  I've been really impressed with Happy Family's line of products and their new Happy Times items really seem to be growing with my family.  Not only are each of these individually packaged, perfect for the school lunch box, they even have a cute little 'message' area where I write basic little notes or draw a little picture to surprise my little girl as she enjoys her lunch at school.  Just so she knows mommy is thinking of her :) My daughter LOVES this snack and it makes me happy that a) she can open it by herself easily b) it's a healthy organic treat of a veggie c) it's organic too!<br /><br />Love this item, keep them coming Happy Family Brands, we really appreciate it, what perfect preschool treat!
920	3	I was very disappointed when my pack of cocoa tins arrived. They are a lot smaller than I thought they would be. I would never have paid $2 a tin for these, and that is half of the original price! I was buying these as Christmas gifts, but they are too small for individual gifts. Just thought I would give everyone a heads up. The cocoa does taste good. Also it is not eligible for returns.
921	5	I love this salt. I order it exclusively, and frequently, from Amazon. I use it on everything - it has become the only product I will use when I need salt. I love the rich flavor of the salt, its strange for me to type this, because I always assumed salt is salt - but I was clearly incorrect.
922	1	I bought this from Amazon since they don't have this kind of coffee locally. I had purchased the identical brand and boldness about a year ago.  Wow, this stuff doesn't even taste like what I had originally! It has an awful burnt taste that lingers as an aftertaste. It really doesn't even compare to what I had before. They must have changed the beans or reduced the quality because it is not smooth at all and has a bitterness and aftertaste that reminds me of the lingering taste after smoking a cigarette. I've decided to switch brands completely. No returns it so I'm stuck with 3 1/2 bricks of sub-par coffee grounds.
923	5	I have been using this milk for my son since he quit breast feeding at 1 year. I find it mixes very well wether the water is warm or cool and he liked the taste from the beginning. This is the second time I was ordered the 6 pack from Amazon because I live out of the country and my family brings it when they visit. Unfortunately when my sister opened the case to pack 2 days before she flew to see me 2 containers were cracked. So if you do ordered it always check immediately to see that there was no damage during shipping because if you wait like we did it is too late to return it. Otherwise I recommend the product.
924	5	A perfect combination of bergamot and tea. Full bergamot flavor. the best Earl Grey tea I have had.
925	5	For the first time in 7 years I could enjoy a hot dog in a bun.  Udis Hot Dog Rolls are the best gluten free rolls I have ever tasted.
926	5	Who ever started making beef jerky tender should be strung up to dry in the wind, but my lawyer says I can't do that. Anyway, this is beef jerky for real men, not some whiny city folks.
927	5	This is one of the best deals on dried pineapple on Amazon. The packages are well design with a ziplock reclosure and a standup bottom. The pineapple is fresh and has the right balance of sugar and moisture. It isn't exactly health food goes, but as a treat is better than most.
928	5	I thought I'd have trouble going through a case of wild rice so I split it with a friend of mine.  I have a couple of recipes that use it and I was having trouble finding wild rice in my local grocery store.  This stuff is great.  I've got on the internet looking for new wild rice recipes for an excuse to use it some more.  The package size is nice so you don't have to open a big honking bag and hope it doesn't spill all over.  I won't have any problems using up a case when this one is gone.
929	5	This product is great. I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea. So many of the teas are sweetened with Splenda type sweeteners and I prefer to use Stevia. The Jackie Chan green tea appears to have been discontinued.<br /><br />I mix this product and love the taste. A little lemon and Stevia and I have the perfect evening iced tea. It provides all the benefits of green tea, and the instant convenience.<br /><br />I give it five stars
930	3	Enjoyed this product for several years.  They have however made changes to the recipe...changing the type of calcium added and other ingredients that seem to have changed. Seems like there is more powder added to the vegetables in the Europa.  So white with calcium you can't even tell the colors of the vegetables. I have written them to inquire about the ingredient changes but haven't heard anything back yet.  My dogs don't care for it much anymore.  It always seems that when a company has a good product they eventually change it to cut costs and it goes downhill from there. Hope this isn't the case with SOJOS.<br /><br />PS. Did hear back from Sojos after resending and asking for a courtesy response. They have changed the formula from calcium carbonate to tri-calcium phosphate with added Vitamin D.  For folks with kidney patient dogs..please do your homework about the effects of the tricalcium phosphate (phosphorus)on kidney patients.Sojos makes a good product.  I hope they reconsider this recipe change so that it will be safe and healthy for all dogs.
931	5	These are so tasty and just the right amount of cacao powder & chocolate blended with goji, chia, sunflower seeds, etc. I love the fact that it taste like a dessert than a health snack, has all natural & organic ingredients and that its good for you. I recommend trying this if you are looking for healthier snack alternatives.
932	5	Our grocery store stopped selling these packets.  I was so excited when I went online and found these!!!  Item came exactly as described and in a timely manner.  I will definitely order more once I run out again!!!
933	2	I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles.
934	4	After having wonderful super salty Scandinavian liquorice for a number of years, I was excited to see that I could order these on Amazon. Sadly though, they weren't as salty as I was looking for! Regardless, this liquorice is great and the shipping was fast as always.
935	5	I love these chocolate chips.  They are the highest cocoa content chips that you can buy at a regular store.  Most other chips are in the 40-50% range.  They taste amazing whether you eat them plain or use them for cookies.  The only thing better is criollo chocolate which is significantly more expensive.<br /><br />The only downside is that they put a small amount of milk fat in them (1-2% of the content according to my telephone call to Ghirardelli), so they are not vegan. Otherwise they are a significant upgrade over the old Ghirardelli double chocolate chips which were around 54% cocoa.<br /><br />Occasionally a bag of chocolate chips will get grainy and taste bad.  I'm not sure if this is due to shipping or storing it in a place that is too warm (or too cold). Fortunately, in my experience this is rare.  This has happened when I tried ordering 3.5 pound bags of these chips. That is unfortunate as buying the 3.5 pound bags can be 30% cheaper.<br /><br />In supermarkets, as of 2010, these retail for around $3.50 per bag.
936	5	Imagine crunchy little almond pieces enrobed in silk made of Nutella and you have the wonderfulness of a Giamanda chocolate. These are so amazing, if/when I have a kid, I plan to name them  Giamanda ...
937	5	I have yet to taste a tea as golden, malty, and rich in flavor as Yorkshire Gold. It is truly a head-to-toe drinking experience!
938	5	Been a huge fan of this mustard for years. It has a perfect balance of spices. All around best mustard for any food
939	5	I used to be able to buy these at my local supermarket, but they no longer carry them.<br /><br />I primarily use them for dunking shellfish.  I'm conscious of my saturated fat intake, and I find them to be an acceptable substitute, in some circumstances.<br /><br />They're pretty useless for baked potatoes...too watery, but they are just fine for snow crab or lobster.  In fact, I've come to prefer the taste to drawn butter.<br /><br />I was so glad to find them for sale on Amazon, and bought the whole box.  I think I'll have enough butter buds to last a lifetime.
940	5	My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K-cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Daybreak are certainly still up there. However, this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast. Almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish. Excellent flavor versus strength. Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!<br /><br />Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K-cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues. Very unfortunate for the other reviewer, but looks like it was rather isolated.<br /><br />Give it a try, you'll certainly enjoy it, the wife and I sure do!
941	5	Original Oberto Thin jerky has always been salty. It's jerky, it's supposed to be salty. Good stuff!
942	5	The price for these K-Cups is great. They are so costly in the store, so this is a great way to buy in bulk.
943	3	I call this Pumpkin Spice Latte 'decent' because the taste is just fine - not fake tasting or chemically - but I could not get my cup to come out creamy or full flavored. I tried many different ratio combos of water to mix but it all just came out watery and thin tasting. Perhaps if you use milk instead of water it might taste better. If you're into instant coffee I'd definitely recommend this flavor though, taste is very nice.
944	4	I eat these nuts daily, right after I eat some fruit. They are wonderful, however it would have been wonderful had they been roasted.
945	5	For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors.
946	5	This is one of my hubby's favorite candies. We have trouble finding them in our city. We used to resort to buying bags of Halloween candy that would have some mixed in it.  Last year, we couldn't even find those.  So, I did an online search, found them, purchased them & my hubby's eating them. They arrived fresh, and tasty.  So very, very glad I found these online.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, Sugar Daddy lollipops are milk caramel. They come in two sizes; this is the smaller size &  approx. 1 x2 x1/4  not including the stick. If you chew on them they will get stuck in your teeth.
947	4	This is a refreshing, tasty, sweet drink, and a nice change from soda.<br />The strawberry/kiwi mix has great taste, and would be terrific on a hot day. I was surprised by the intensity of the flavor, and did not expect the sweetness.<br />My personal preference, though, is for non-carbonated drinks, and I would have preferred it without carbonation.<br />It is also quite high in calories at 135 calories for 8.3 ounces, which is fairly hefty.<br />I believe that this is a healthier, better tasting summer drink, which has a much more natural and fresher taste than colas do, and I believe that most people will really love it.
948	5	This coffee is very good and I recommend it. It tastes fresh and full bodied. It is much better than I expected it to be.  I will order it again.
949	1	Bought this in sept. and did not pay to much attention to price at 16.83  3lb box and then saw them in the store for 7.99. Boy did i feel  like an idiot.  do your comparison shopping and do not waste your money on 3rd party sellers.Update.. Food 4 less had this box for 6.49 good buy and the cookies were fresh this time ?
950	4	Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them. I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors. This is one of their favorites.  And it is a better deal than in the stores.  So that is super for me.
951	5	if you've been to england or australia and liked what they put on toast this is the stuff - vegimite in australia - i like it in a sandwich with mozarella cheese
952	1	First off - these don't ship well.  When I recieved my package (even though it was clearly sealed and had not been opened) it looked like there were several cookies missing, there was a lot of empty space in the package allowing the cookies that were in there to slide all over, and several were broken as a result.  If you really REALLY want to try these, I would look for them at the local store rather than buy online and have them shipped.<br /><br />That being said....I'm awfully glad I didn't actually pay for these.  I've never been a fan of Chips Ahoy cookies - even as a kid.  They're just so over-processed and artificial tasting.  I was hoping the extra blob of fudge in these might help make up for that, but not really.  I can't justify buying awful-tasting cookies when it's not that difficult to make your own, or even to buy from a local bakery which tastes a million times better and fresher.<br /><br />I cannot recommend these - they were not packaged well, and did not taste any better than I expected.
953	3	I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.
954	5	I got this as a sample. Absolutely delicious. They use real friggin soy sauce and you can taste it. It was a real pleasure to eat this.
955	5	This chips kind of reminded me of bacon bits. The six small bags were the perfect size and there's no MSG. They were a little expensive, but considering they came from the UK it's understandable. Half the price was in the shipping. They are well worth the indulgence once in awhile.
956	5	Definitely have to love this product!  The fleas hop on to this sticky paper and can't hop back off again!  It's also easy to change out this sticky paper so it's virtually mess free!  Worth every penny!!!
957	5	This chicken broth has a wonderful flavor and color--much deeper than other chicken broths I've used in the past.  Plus the one cup size is perfect for recipes, eliminating the waste often encountered with canned broth.
958	5	These are the freshest raisins I have ever eaten.<br />I usually don't care much for them, eating only a<br />small box about twice a year.<br /><br />However, since I have found Newman's Organic,<br />I really like them & plan on getting more as a<br />part of a healthier eating plan.
959	5	I ordered the red label Heinz Genuine Dills and got these instead.  They taste just like the red label sour and delicious.
960	5	They are definitely Teddy Grahms.  In much better shape than what I could buy at the store.  Not many broken crackers.
961	4	I was involved in a food challenge using this product.  It was not, however, a challenge set up by Slap Ya Mama, but rather a person in  a foodie group that fell in love with the seasoning.  We were provided free seasoning mixes of both regular and hot.<br /><br />Being involved in said challenge meant using SYM in as many ways as we could.  And let me tell you, there are lots of ways.  This stuff is pretty great and very versatile.  It works on meat, fish, stews, vegetables, sauces.  It is killer with sweet potatoes.  Chicken wings, dipped in butter then sprinkled with SYM and baked will rock your world.<br /><br />Personally, I like a mix of half regular, half hot.  This largely due to the saltiness of the regular blend, which is *really* salty.<br /><br />I guess a good indicator of my enjoyment of the product is that even after being given freebie mixes, I actually came in here and bought a six-pack when I ran out.
962	2	The label on the syrup does not say grade b I just starting the second bottle and noticed it. I would like to order 4 more but not sure do to the label and it didn't say organic either.
963	5	This creamer is delicious and comes conveniently in a single serving so you don't over-do.  Absolutely yummy.  You won't go wrong with this.
964	1	This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is  russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA .  Notice that this product title starts with  Alaskan Salmon , minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of  Grained Salmon Caviar   looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see  made in USA  and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was  sorry I was out of town .  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.
965	5	Man, this is a lot of candy, well worth the price.  For anyone curious the package has grape, strawberry, sour apple, and banana...  Does anyone even like the Banana ones?  Wish it had watermelon instead, but I guess every bag of variety candy has to have one flavor someone doesn't like :-).
966	5	I keep Gerber 'Mixed' and 'Barley' on hand all the time. The 'mixed' consists of rice, oat and wheat so I mix a box of that with a box of the 'barley' and have a completely balanced breakfast cereal. I don't use it for people: I keep it handy for when the dogs have upset tummies and their regular food is too harsh on their digestive systems and they need soft, easy to digest food that fills them up and is healthy for them.  As their tummies return to normal, I reduce the baby cereal a bit and add in some of their normal foods and as they continue to improve, the baby cereal gets reduced while their normal foods eventually return to full bore.<br /><br />This is good for them, too, after dental cleanings/extractions, surgeries, when they need a little help in the 'bowel' department (fiber), or just as an added treat to change it up a bit in their daily diet.<br /><br />I have used this in place of bread crumbs when making a meatloaf (ok, I was desperate), but didn't care for the texture of the meatloaf once cooked. It was too soft for our liking, but still quite tasty.
967	4	I'm the kind of guy who has great blood pressure and no real medical conditions -- and I'd like to keep it that way. I recently started the Atkins Nutritional Approach and I'm having great success. However, as a side effect to eating healthier, the salt (and sugar, for that matter) found in most prepared foods is becoming hard to swallow -- most places simply use too much.<br /><br />I purchased this at a local store on a whim to see if I can balance my home cooking with the high-sodium foods found outside of my home. I never tried it before because I know a lot of people have an unpleasant reaction to it, such as a bitter or metallic taste. I'm happy to say it tastes great to me. It has the same  buzz  or  bite  as salt does, you don't need to use quite as much to get the same saltiness in foods as with Sodium-Chloride, and I experience no aftertaste or metallic/bitter flavor. It also seems to bring out accompanying flavors, such as garlic, just as well as real salt does.<br /><br />The only slight problem, and the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it doesn't have an after-taste but an  after-effect . I get a very slight feeling of tightness in my throat, like when you salivate before vomiting. It sounds a lot worse than it is, because it's a very mild effect. Salt actually does the same thing to the palate, but not as strongly as Potassium-Chloride does; for me, at least.<br /><br />Overall an excellent substitute for a more healthy lifestyle that just takes a little  getting used to .
968	5	I love having this coconut milk on hand for curry and other creamy recipes. But mostly what I use it for is its creamy top layer. I put a can in the fridge so that when opened I can scoop off the thick, hardened coconut cream. This I put in a bowl and whip it up using the whisk attachment on my immersion blender. I often add back just a little of the coconut water left in the can. The beautiful whipped cream results are useful for topping anything that you might want whipped cream on. I also use it in my tea. The left over water can be drunk, poured over pet food, added to any recipe that needs liquid. Nothing is wasted.<br /><br />Note: I don't use coconut milk because I have to avoid dairy; no, not at all. I also use many dairy products. I just think this is a good way to experience a very tasty and healthy alternative.
969	5	I prepackaged this Teff in small serving sized bags which made it easy to just grab and throw in a pot of boiling water. It has a very good flavor.
970	3	I like the idea of a  naturally sweetened  diet soda, but the after taste was worse than diet pepsi or diet coke.  If you are determined to drink a more natural diet soda then this is your best option.
971	5	I am not a bean fan by any means, however, these Anasazi beans are scrumptious. I have replaced pinto beans with these and my husband and I cannot get enough of them. Bob's Red Mill has a terrific selection of grains and beans and I will continue to order items from them. Good stuff!
972	4	great service and delivery for a really good product. i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best, along with green mountain...
973	5	This product works very well. It taste great. Its a nice touch to the end of a day. PLEASE USE AS DIRECTED! PLEASE!!!!!
974	5	These tortilla chips are excellent. Great flavor, good ingredients and nutrition for what it is (low saturated fat, low sodium, HIGH fiber per serving). What a wonderful find for the health conscious consumer. OF course moderation is needed when consuming such a product as it is caloric. But if you are feeling the need for some tortilla chips, reach for these: You won't be disappointed!
975	5	I have tried a lot of the k-cup coffees and this one is by far the BEST!  It's a medium blend coffee with a strikingly good taste-smooth and NO bitterness!
976	5	i don't know why one reviewer said the orange flavor was overpowering.  i find it has an excellent taste and nice orange aroma.  love the tea and have been drinking it several times a day.  i'm buying more.
977	5	The best product on the market for making Salsa.  I have been using for years.  Just by giving my family and friends samples of the salsa, they have all been purchasing this product.  The only problem is it is hard to find in stores but ordering on line the pricing is much better.
978	1	I like Folgers coffee, I like chocolate.  How bad could this be?  Turns out very bad.  An overwhelming flavor of cheap hot chocolate drowns out whatever coffee flavor there is.
979	5	I bought this caramel corn in my local grocery store and that was it. They stop selling it and I freaked out. I searched online for the maker of this wonderfully addicting caramel cob and found that I could order it by the case, so i did. Mmmmm... warm it just a little in the microwave and walah you have a delicious desert. I am totally addicted and im never without. It is heavenly.
980	5	Each dog will have its own favorite, and that may vary day to day. This has an unknown flavor but it is the favorite flavor of my Havanese. 2nd is Chicken. 3rd is surprizingly vanilla mint. Disliked most is BBQ and liver. Though he likes freeze dried liver treats. Sometimes likes chicken and vegetables. I have tried all flavors and this is the one that is chewed non-stop.
981	3	Considering how much matcha you get, this product is probably a pretty good deal, especially if you're new to green tea and can't really taste much difference between grades.  However, if you're used to a ceremonial matcha, this definitely isn't it and I would go elsewhere.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer before in that the shipping from Pier Mall was superfast.  I received the product in two business days!
982	4	I 1st seen these on Shark Tank and what drew me to them was they were made for a diabetic by a diabetic. I decided to try a box and I can truly say they do taste good. They do fulfill that sweet satisfaction you look for. I'm not a big fan on granola bars but I think I can get use to these. They are also healthy, can't go wrong with that.
983	4	I love these sugar packets, because it's natural sugar, and it makes my iced latte taste great.<br />I put these in my iced coffee or iced latte and I can taste the little sugar crystals on the bottom of the drink when I sip with my straw.  It's delicious and sweetens perfectly.
984	4	I was a barista for 15 years and sold excellent coffee while living in San Francisco.  I love coffee. When I developed gastrointestinal issues coffee became something I couldn't drink without suffering immensely.  I began a search for coffee I could drink.  I bought a Toddy system which removes 70% of the acid and will still use that method, but it isn't always convenient and a pound of coffee doesn't go as far with that system in my experience.  A friend brought me some low-acid beans and I enjoyed waking up in the morning and grinding beans for a fresh cup. It still gave me heartburn but was easier on me than regular coffee, somewhat.  But I SO enjoyed making fresh coffee again, so I searched for a low-acid coffee when my little stash ran out, and that's when I found Puroast.  I have never bought ground coffee, always whole bean, so had very low expectations on all counts.  But that's how desperate I was to have fresh coffee, I figured it's worth a try.  This coffee really is low acid and I can enjoy a cup or two each morning.  I don't feel as if I'm drinking an inferior coffee and I LOVE that it's organic, free trade.  I loved Peet's french roast, so if Peet's is a 10 then this coffee is a 7 or 8, which I think is incredible for a low-acid coffee and not even a dark french.  This is coffee I don't have to apologize for when sharing it with friends.  I am ordering more.
985	5	I haven't been to australia, but I have heard of this from a youtuber  itsjudytime  and she reviewed these which got me to want to try these out because she made them look that good! Luckily i read a comment that they are sold at  cost plus world market ! I remember passing by one but never really had the curiousity to go check it out until now. Found one near by, and tada...there they were! Wasn't called Tim tams but arnott's was the one i found and to my surprise...3/4 of the boxes were gone, only 3 left so that tells me..it must be delicious! They were about $3.99 at the store and lucky I found them there or else pay for big fee of shipping (but then again, i suppose these would be worth the price for how deelish they are!) so check em out at your nearest world market! I made some hot chocolate and shabam....i was in heaven. I could only eat two in one sitting but if i could..i'd eat the whole thing :) I'll forsure am going to buy some more!
986	1	One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you can't return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off.
987	5	I'm not a coffee drinker but my husband is.  I got a sampler pack that included this flavor, and he loved it, prompting me to buy a box it it.  We had a family party this past weekend and when people smelled this flavor coffee they wanted to try it.  Everyone raved about this Cinnamon Roll coffee.  ALMOST makes me want to try a cup, but I'll stick to enjoying the scent of this  new Favorite  in my house.
988	5	This is the perfect cocoa to sit by a fire/listen ot the rain/cuddle next to your loved ones. I had to order it on amazon, since it was only available in UT where I used to live. I'm so glad I ordered it!  Choc  Rasp is the best flavor but Chocolate Hazelnut, Chocolate Mint, and Milk Chocolate are also excellent.
989	5	Awesome quick fix for curry craving.  Instant laksa curry is hard to find, let alone this is more of a restaurant brand, not a typical store-brand that you can find in Asian market for curry mixes. I've searched high & low in Northern-Cal to no avail, jumping with joy that Amazon carries it now,<br /><br />Follow the instructions, and add some seafood of your choice, fried tofu, sprouts, rice noodle, and whatnot, then you will have a satisfying treat.  Give it a try, a good chance you would like it if you dig creamy broth, and South Asian food.<br /><br />Oh, don't forget to add finely minced Vietnamese mint if you can get some, or even Thai basil. For fresh herbs enhance the flavor; eat like the locals.  5 big, enthusiastic stars!
990	3	tastes like SNAILES!! LOL!!my dog eats everything but wouldn't touch these! just wanted to try and see what all the fuss is about! BUT SERIOUSLY! i thought the would be prepared and ready to eat, going to look for recipe and prepare the second can
991	5	Delicious!  My wife and I love this curry!  It is a little bit on the spicy side, so our daughter will only eat a little of it, but that is great, because it leaves more for us.  She prefers the chick pee curry!
992	5	The first time I heard about decaf (on a sitcom), I assumed it was a joke. Yet, those bottled laughs weren't heard in the background. Could it be...? An American teacher later informed me that yes, there really is such a thing.<br /><br />Decaf must be the most stupid invention in world history. I mean, coffee without caffeine?! That's rather like coke without cocaine. Or tobacco without nicotine. Or the Democratic Party without Bill Clinton.<br /><br />It lacks the active substance.
993	5	This is a great low-calorie, non-carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage. After going thru bariatric surgery, this product was a great find.. It sparks up a hum-drum beverage world. Salute'
994	5	Vegan or not, teriyaki primal strips are utterly delicious.  I cannot get enough of them.  The flavor is unimaginable.  The texture is incredible.  Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive, as far as that goes.  But you cannot go wrong on flavor and texture.  These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far.
995	5	These pistachios are exaclty as advertised. Fresh, great tasting, good size _ I am extremely please with my purchase. This is my new favorite pistachio brand!  The price was good too - I will be ordering Keenan Farms from now on!
996	4	I purchased this in order to mill my own baby oatmeal and my now 7 month old really like it! Buying pre-milled or dissovleable cereal was fine at first when I was testing to see what she would like. Now that I know oatmeal is a huge hit, I buy Arrowhead Mills Organic Steel Cut Oats and mill them up myself. It takes very little time and saves me a mint! She enjoys it plain or mixed with bannana or apple. It freezes and reheats perfectly for those who make batches to freeze. I cook this up and puree the fruit of choice and put one half oatmeal and one half fruit puree in the silicone freezer trays. Baby and I are very glad I found this!<br /><br />For the adult review, yes it tastes great. I am the type that usually has to doctor oatmeal quite a bit before it suits me - I don't put anything in this. Its a staple in my home now!
997	3	Recently purchased through Amazon and delivery arrived promptly and beautifully packaged inside the box - and was a decent sized bottle. Both my wife and I love real white and black truffles, and we thought the oil smelled wonderful, but to be honest we are somewhat disappointed with the flavor, which was metallic and overly  meaty  in taste. Also, the bottle opening does not have a flow drip control, so instead of using a few drops/drizzle, it tends to pour out and you need to be very careful not to use too much or it ruins/overwhelms the food dish. Maybe we got a funky bottle but we were hoping for a better gourmet experience.
998	3	I have really enjoyed a few flavored coffees, such as the Pecan product on Amazon. The price was good and the reviews decent for this one, but the flavors dont' really meld, they kinda battle each other. It's like a nice medium roast coffee, it's really a nice coffee underneath, but then it has this whammy of aromatic pumkin, not very complimentary. My wife and I both enjoy nice coffee and have similar opinion on this one. It is holiday-ish and smells GREAT as it's brewing, as the little woman said  I just wanna dive in there!  But the flavors just don't meld. Nice try but not awesome.
999	5	Excellent beef product.  I love the single packets this makes at easy to keep it safe and store it at room temp.
1000	4	These are delicious cookies but I just cancelled my subscription. I hope the price comes back down so I can buy them again. They are the best ginger snaps I have found so far but the price is just too much :-(
1001	5	The cinnamon flavor in this hot chocolate is similar to those little red hot candies.  The flavor is not overpowering (and it is not hot).  It is a good mix of chocolate and cinnamon.
1002	5	These are magical. Put them in the microwave and they literally pop into a fresh hot crackly bag of pork rinds. They're a little on the salty side but no more so than most of the pork rinds you buy in the store. Each bag fills up a large cereal bowl. Good for a little snack when you need it and you don't want popcorn.
1003	1	I ordered Grove Square K-cups - the cappuccino variety, for my Keurig BREWER.  As with all of the other K-cup coffees I've purchased, I expected it to be filled with coffee for my Keurig to BREW.  Unfortunately, it is filled with instant coffee and flavored with creamer and sweetners.  It tastes HORRIBLE.  I'm pitching the rest -it's not even worth donating to our church.  If I'd wanted Sanka, I would not have purchased an expensive coffee brewer - the microwave would have been good enough!  What I WANT is a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  The product description did not disclose the fact that it is fake coffee.  If a real cup of freshly brewed coffee is what you want from your Keurig brewer, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1004	5	These are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken. My 20 pound Sheltie loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her. I highly recommend these for any dog, especially one with food allergies.
1005	5	My 13 yr old son has peanut and tree nut allergies  and we maintain a peanut/nut  free home.  We had tried soy nut butter as a substitute for peanut butter and we didn't like it.  Sunbutter, made from sunflower seeds, tastes and smells very similar to peanut butter.  My family eats so much of this product that we have subscribed to get a case of 6 from Amazon on a monthly basis.  There is also a  crunchy  version which is good as well.
1006	5	My dog loves these. One lasts her about a week. i put one in her crate while im at work and she nibbles at it. its funny because my cats like them too, i found them stealing them from my pom and licking them. i will be buying these again.
1007	5	My kids love this mac and cheese.  I stopped feeding them the Kraft brand months ago because of all the junk ingredients.  With simple organic ingredients I can feel a better about feeding them a processed food.  Thanks to amazon for making this so readily available!! We don't have a natural grocery store in town and even if we did I'm sure they'd price gouge the heck out of it.
1008	5	I live in a very rural area. There is a store about 15 miles away that sells Alvita teas. The last two times I have been there they have been out of Valerian Root Tea. i find this product very effective in helping me sleep. This seller was inexpensive and responded very quickly to my order. Thank you!
1009	5	My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!
1010	5	With Subscribe and Save, I'm paying 30% less than the supermarket price, and I don't have to worry about running out or lugging the boxes around.  This is great!
1011	3	This ia a nicely flavored pricey gourmet vegan chili.  Although it doesn't have that traditional chili taste, it is a uniquely flavored gourmet chili.<br /><br />The chili is mild flavored with sweet undertones.  This particular variety is low fat medium spicy.  It is actually not very spicy at all.<br /><br />The chili has no GMOs, no bioengineered ingredients, no trans fats, no added MSG, and no preservatives.<br /><br />The chili ingredients are organic black beans, filtered water, organic onions, organic tomato puree, organic diced tomatos, organic bell peppers, organic green chiles, organic high Oleic safflower and/or sunflower oil, organic lime juice, sea  salt, organic spices, organic garlic, and black pepper.<br /><br />The chili has 200 cal. per serving and the container states that it holds 2 servings.  Each serving is said to be one cup or 260 g.<br /><br />Each serving also contains 3 g fat, 680 mg sodium, 31 g carbs, 13 g fiber, 3 g sugar, and 13 g protein.<br /><br />I give this chili 3/5 for flavor, 5/5 for thickness and texture, 5/5 for maintaining organic integrity, 0/5 for truth in labeling.<br /><br />If my math is correct, a cup is still 8 oz. and the can only holds 14.7 oz. Therefore, two servings should equal 16 oz. and not 14.7 oz.<br /><br />The chili also has an extremely high sodium content 680 mg for a total of 1360 mg per can.
1012	5	I got these for my son and they are so convent to put in the diaper bag or my purse and make a great quick health snack for him, I am always on the lookout for items that make being a mom easier and this is one of those products.
1013	5	For the last year, our Tassimo machine has made only tea, as all the coffees are greatly lacking. Instead we buy imported German coffees which are the best in the world.<br /><br />We use 3 Teas: #1, the Best is Twinings Earl Grey<br />  #2, next best is Twinings Green Tea<br />  #3, next best is Tazmo Awake Black Tea.<br /><br />These teas are all great & if you can get some good natural North Dakota honey to put in them, you will like them even more.
1014	3	I was excited to find green tea with earl gray flavor.I also read my ingredients.So far so good, bergamot flavoring .But I also happen to read Russian,and translated the ingredient reads  bergamot flavouring,identical to the natural one .Why use artificial flavor when the real one is easy to come by? I try to avoid artificial colors and flavors so this one was a downer(discovered it too late).It tastes fine otherwise.
1015	5	I consistantly use this product in place of fresh milk.  It lasts longer, and tastes just as good.  Unfortunately I can't always find it in local grocery stores.
1016	5	I have three very different cats, with very different tastes. The Science Diet adult hairball formula is one all three will eat without a fuss. They really like the taste, and have been eating it for years. Plus, it really works to prevent hairballs! I've tried many different brands, but I always come back to this one because I know it's high quality and they will eat it. If they ever stop making this particular one I'm in trouble, they don't seem to like the other Science Diet kinds!
1017	4	Delicious! broken slabs of delectable chocolate with a nice tart bite of orange! Comes in cute little bags with just the right amount in each one.
1018	5	The bread is great and is the best gluten-free bread available, however this is a terrible price. Typically it is $4.99 at any grocery store and Trader Joe's is even less. Amazon should provide a bulk price break.
1019	4	I just made this and it was quite good. I added sweet onions and mushrooms which really added depth to the dish. I'm sure this would taste great plain as well. I'm going to experiment with more vegetables in the future. It was a bit more spicy than the butter chicken paste. I tasted some saffron and ginger and perhaps a kick of red pepper. Try making some homemade naan bread to go along with it.
1020	5	This is soup is so awesome. My two children, who don't  like  onions, love this stuff. It does have a good oniony flavor, but in a great, healthy, healing way. I've tried duplicating this in my kitchen, and it's of no use. This just hits the spot, right on, everytime.
1021	4	Wonderful Coffee, had to drink regular coffee yesterday, dumped it out after half a cup! Just what I needed, a new habit! Enjoy.
1022	1	My son loved the original recipe Chick Chick but Happy Baby has now changed the recipe.  My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to  improve  upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten.
1023	5	I LOVE this Soup! Little  burgers  with thick gravy float in a sea of hearty vegetables. Unlike many other canned soups, these have real meat and veggies of  size  that you can sink your teeth into!<br /><br />You do have to be careful of  can size  when comparing prices (for quantity). This size is 10.75 ounces ( the smaller can size), the other reviewers are comparing to the 18.8 ounce sizes mostly seen in the bigger supermarkets and  Box  stores. This size is perfect for me for a quick lunch or snack. I appreciate being able to purchase these in quantity-a  case  price, delivered to my door!<br /><br />Many Amazon buyers may be confused. Yes, you can probably find and purchase this and many other Grocery/Gourmet items somewhere else for less money. Although I am far from wealthy, I use the Grocery  products and delivery  services  Amazon provides as a Convenience. Saves me  tons of time  and for me, my  time  is more valuable than saving a few dollars or searching for sales.<br /><br />I choose to spend my time and energy on more relaxing and creative pursuits, rather than chasing after the best price of cans of soup, gourmet snacks, or favorite cereals. If I can buy it online-I probably will!
1024	1	While it does have the flavor, it also has an after taste that the organic product does not.  The fair trade organic version is a little more costly, however their process is different and it gives a crisper cleaner taste than this product offers.  I thought I could save a little money, turns out like most things, you get what you pay for.  Equal Exchange carries the organic, fair trade verison if you want to try it)
1025	5	I have a home daycare and have a child allergic to nuts. I ordered this because we couldn't fool the kids with our local alternative (Sunbutter). I had two toddlers that would go without before they would eat sunbutter because they could tell it wasn't peanut butter. I ordered this without putting much hope into it as I've tried several and could never trick the pickiest kiddos. I was pleasantly suprized when I served this and not a one kid could tell it wasn't the real thing. I'm glad I ordered such a large quantity. I will be using this from now one. It is by far the best alternative out there.  A HUGE bonus is the fact that there aren't a bunch of additives.  Anything that uses Cane Sugar and Sea Salt always sit better with me anyway. Great product!
1026	5	My husband asked for Wheatana cereal, which had been enjoyed by both of us in earlier days.  I confidently went to the grocery store to buy some and was unsucessful in all stores so went to the internet.  I found it was no longer available in the US, as the company had been sold to one in the UK, but through Amazon was able to find this product, order it and now it once again is cooked and eaten in our home.  Delivery was timely and packing of the boxes was excellent. Now we have an international breakfast!!
1027	3	Colorful and tasty, but I am not sold on the nutrition.  Corn, chicken by-products, and corn gluten meal are the first three ingredients.  Then we get to wheat flour, animal fat, and rice flour.  Hmmm.  And what is  animal digest ?  Vitamins, carrots, and peas do show up later in the list, but so do Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 2, all for human viewing pleasure, not our dogs' nutrition.  The packaging looks great, showing chunks of fresh beef, fresh peas, carrots, and corn.  But  I think we will stick with our tried and true, high-quality dog food, as opposed to this well-packaged and highly marketed dog food.
1028	5	These are really good. Not hard to chew like some other beef nuggets, and they don't dry out so much.<br /><br />They only downside is that the bag stays very moist inside, so it can be a little messy. If you try to eat a bag while on the drive home you have grease all over your steering wheel.....
1029	3	I'm a pickled egg lover, and not having the time to do some myself, I decided to buy some because I couldn't find a store out here that carried them.<br /><br />They are quite spicy, but much more 'rubbery' than I'm used to. It has a great flavor- but I can't get passed the texture lol.
1030	5	I have been eating marzipan for many years and its always hard to find in stores, I have been ordering 2 boxes every week for a while and only one box wasnt realy fresh, they have a nice flavor and just the right amount of suger.
1031	4	Since this honey professes to be raw (actually, it is warmed/heated) and unfiltered (actually, they tell you on the label in small print that they filter it) I was prepared for little bits and floaters to be in it, but it is clear as a bell.  The flavor is a mild sort of wildflower flavor - but different - more mellow.  It's sweet, but not overly so and it's not as thick as many raw wildflower honeys can be.  Its color is a nice rich amber.<br /><br />The bottles are easy to handle but I get nervous about handling them with the pour spout when they are full as the cap isn't the most securely fitting thing in the world.  It just feels weak to me.  They arrived really well packed for transit so I didn't experience any messy losses due to shipping.<br /><br />The manufacturers might want to consider redoing their label as the information they provide is confusing:  Raw & Unfiltered verses the fine print stating that it is heated/warmed & filtered.  It matters a lot to some folks and is the only reason I docked a star.  Regardless, the honey rocks.
1032	5	This vanilla is a large one quart bottle of quality product. For the cost, compared to the small containers found at the local grocery stores, it is a great product, that will go a long way for your baked goods.  Happy Cooking 
1033	5	It tastes just like the restaurants.  I love it.  I put about 8 tea bags together in the coffee/tea maker pot.  The best!
1034	5	Badia a Coltibuono olive oil is a legend, deservedly so. But be forewarned -- if you are used to the bland olive oils sold mass market in most supermarkets, the strong assertive character may come as somewhat of a shock. As noted in the Amazon product description,  according to Deborah Krasner in  The Flavors of Olive Oil , this oil  ...is strongly and pleasantly bitter, with a pronounced burn....'It made my face scrunch up.' Very green and grassy, this is an oil made for drizzling.   I would tend to agree with that. In my opinion, this is really at it's best drizzled over grilled meats, vegetables and salads almost as a condiment. For dipping bread and most cooking (it's too expensive for most chefs on a budget like mine anyway) you might prefer an oil from Sicily, Spain, Australia or California, which are softer and more buttery. That said, for purists, this may be the right olive oil even for bread dipping. It's flavors and aromas are remarkably complex and powerful.
1035	5	If you like your coffee strong this is the K-Cup for you!  I've tried the 'bold' coffees from various manufacturers here on Amazon and this is the one that wins hands down.  It's strong, it has a kick but the flavor is still smooth and subtle.
1036	5	Newman's Own Special Blend Extra Bold is a great tasting coffee for any time of day.  It's flavor stands out even with cream.  I like strong bold coffee and this is my favorite every day general use coffee.
1037	3	This coffee is not quite what I thought it to be. Taste a little on the strong side. It is rather pricy, and yet I found it on sale, so I thought. I have plenty of caribou and that should hold me for a while until the seasonal coffees come out, hopefully they will not be so high in price. Saw a review on the Kcup coffees and found that they got the rating of being simply just  ok , so it is more of the easy of making the coffee rather than the price or quality of the brew of coffee. I shall keep my eyes peeled for the cheapest place to buy my kcups. The day break of the caribou is the best variety of the caribou brand.
1038	5	We have no food sensitivities or allergies in our family, but I wanted chocolate chips that weren't full of garbage sugars and emulsifiers. There are other brands out there that have good ingredients, but this brand is the only one I can find that also has this tiny sized chip. I love the ingredients, taste and size. We use them for baking and for trail mix. A regular sized chocolate chip is just too much in a handful of trail mix - especially if you have little ones who don't need much in the way of chocolate.
1039	5	Great product!!  The flavor is amazing and the recipie on the back is great!  The only problem was the packaging... it wasn't done properly and I lost a bottle....
1040	5	Agave Nectar is the only sweetner we use in our household. If you haven't tried it yet, you should.
1041	4	Both steaks in The Celebration are sufficiently large, and the filet is amazing. The strip is good but not great, but can feed two.
1042	5	These are the best Gummi Bears. My kids love them and they don't last very long in my house. Have placed 2 orders in a month.
1043	4	My first shipment of corn chips was rancid and absolutely inedible. That was very unfortunate because Garden of Eatin'chips can be very tasty. The Amazon vendor was no longer shipping so they were not replaced. I thought I was out the cost of a case of corn chips and still hungry.<br />  But...........<br />Upon hearing my concern, Amazon found a vendor and sent a new shipment at their cost next day. Those chips are absolutely perfect! Amazon's responsiveness, service and customer care is exceptional! Thanks Amazon for a superb customer experience and for renewing my faith in Garden of Eaten' Blue Corn Chips!
1044	4	This is a perfectly healthy, portable and vitamin packed snack for toddlers.  My one year old loves them.  I wish the cap was just a tad bigger because the first thing he wants to do is play with it, however (much like the warning on the product says) it is too small and poses a chocking hazzard.  I love that he can either squeeze it himself or just suck the yogurt out of the opening.  The size is appropriate, for a snack, and the ease of just tossing into the diaper bag can't be beat.  It's a better deal to order on Amazon (especially subscribe and save) than purchasing in the grocery store, but still a slightly high priced snack.
1045	5	I use this for everything, I made brownies with it today and the other day I used it to make hot cocoa. I use it for frosting and cheesecake, smoothies and no bake cookies. It is better than any cocoa I have ever used. The flavor is amazingly rich and delicious.
1046	4	I am lucky in that my 1 year Chihuahua isn't picky about his snacks and will eat just about anything. This product is no exception. I gave him one and he promptly took it to his favorite  eating spot  on the rug and went at it. I like the fact that it is low in fat and has somewhat natural ingredients as well as being good for the teeth. Since Chihuahuas can have dental problems, I am all for products that keep their teeth in good condition, since dental cleanings are quite expensive. Anyhow, he knows where his treats are kept and will eagerly anticipate getting one of these or some other tasty snack. Although it's made in China, my dog hasn't had any adverse reaction to the product. The product can get expensive but you can probably find a deal on it at your local pet store. That's how I first discovered these.
1047	5	Unlike any green tea I ever tasted.  I drink it every day.  Has a full body and rich roasted aroma, making it a great alternative to coffee.  Cheap and easier to get from Amazon than making stops at Asian markets.
1048	5	I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.
1049	1	Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here).
1050	1	Like the previous reviewer, I also received a wet box, with most of the bottles leaking from the spout.  The ones that weren't leaking will start to soon, as the spouts are also starting to rip.<br /><br />Opened a safe-looking bottle, and couldn't stand the taste.  I drank regular ONE coconut water throughout my pregnancy, and kept hearing good things about vita coco... luckily they didn't try this flavor...
1051	5	My dog loves Booda Bones.  They are a bit pricy so I only give him a couple a week as a special treat.  I'll continue buying them from Amazon for the best price.
1052	1	The candy was not as I expected. It tasted old and stale. Not the candy I remember as a child.
1053	1	Low calorie, its true. Try other flavors not Salt & Vinegar.  Wish I could return them, but we ate 2.  Or at least tried to, yuck!
1054	4	This tea has an great black currant flavor and it a good deal for the price.  I have used Tea Forte black currant in the past and found this one to be just as good as theirs.  Great smooth flavor with no metally aftertaste that tea can sometime have.  Delicious!
1055	4	This is by far the best coconut milk we have found, because there are no added gums. (Be careful - the organic version does contain guar gum.) We have one family member that is very sensitive to gums, and the rest of us just don't like the taste or texture.<br /><br />Last time I checked the can still had BPA, but sometimes with food you have to pick your battles!
1056	3	I think these are ok, but not great.  I don't know if I'd buy them again, but will eat up what I have and enjoy them.  They have quite a bit of an artificial flavor and they are overly-sweetened like many sugar-free foods.
1057	5	I have one picky eater pooch. On top of that, she has a sensitive stomach. That being said, this kibble is perfect. No harsh ingredients to upset her tummy, yet it tastes good enough that she wolfs it down. I love the fact that it is grain free, and I love that I can get it shipped on a regular basis!
1058	5	My husband and I love this coffee, however there were only a couple of supermarkets in our area that carried it, so I was very happy to see it being sold on Amazon in bulk.  This is the best hazelnut k-cup coffee we have found yet, it is a daily drinker for us and the price on Amazon is great!
1059	5	I ordered both the Chili Nacho and the Parmesan. I found the chili nacho may favorite. I am vegetarian with a gluten sensitivity, so these are wonderful for giving me a healthy crunch with protein and no gluten. I have like these as well as most chips. I have now subscribed and I hope I don't run into the stale problem another reviewer did.
1060	1	These are the worst potato chips I have ever had. They are way, way too salty. And, to make matters worse, the manufacturer adds fructose sugar to the recipe, which adds an inappropriate sweet note. I would definitely not recommend these chips. Luckily, I did not buy a case. I picked up a single bag from my local grocer. I do not understand all the favorable reviews for this product! I think these chips are just awful!
1061	4	We have a golden doodle who is a strong chewer. His nylabones usually last but he chewed this one in half in about a week. He absolutely loves this toy though. It is his favorite even a month later when he only has a part of it left. If he wasn't such a strong chewer I would definitely get this toy again.
1062	5	This energy drink taste great for a sugar free beverage and it does give you a boost without the jittery feeling that I have experienced with other drinks. Is a little pricey but worth it in the long run.
1063	5	This is the best gluten free muffin mix I have tried.  You can add anything to the mix and it holds up well.  One of my fav's is adding diced apples, raisins and cinnamon.  Of course blueberries are great too.  They are not gritty at all and are good even after a few days if kept in a sealed container or bag in the refrigerator. Just pop them in the micro for 20 seconds and they are great! They freeze very well too.
1064	5	I can drink a couple of these a day! I am glad the 17oz comes with a cap.  Easier to store them once you open a pack.  I've ordered VitaCoco, One and Zico.  I find VitaCoco brand to have the best flavor.  Best served chilled.<br />I bought three cases of these on Fri and it was at my door step today (Monday) with my prime account.  Had a problem with one of the box.  Upon opening the amazon box, I see that one of the case was already opened and few of packs were damaged and leaking.  I called Amazon right away and they resolved it right away.<br />As the title says, great product and great service! thanks amazon.
1065	2	This coffee was bitter and more oily than I would expect from Colombian. It's OK, but I am glad to have finished it so I can move on to something better
1066	5	This is an excellent chai tea! My other favorite chai teas are Stash Double Spice and Mighty Leaf Chai.<br /><br />The Mountain High Chai is a little sweeter than some and extremely smooth. I am very pleased.
1067	5	Well, I'll be darned, I tried the -- contains NO alcohol --<br />JACK DANIALS ; JIM BEAM ; BUDWIESER ; and WHITE LIT'NIN<br />barbeque sauces, so I tried this when I saw it at my local<br />store...<br />It's okay, but I think I'll just keep pouring REAL Dr Pepper<br />on my ribeye steaks' charcoal flames.<br />Ummmmm!<br /> 10:00 2:00 4:00...Drink a bite to eat ... indeed!
1068	3	this vanilla is just so overwhelmingly artificial! green mountain does better in bold blend than these flavored ones. i'm surprised some people think there's still not enough vanilla taste..
1069	5	A well flavored Tea for after dinner or to use when you have trouble sleeping. I have purchaced this enjoyable tea twice from amazon. I highly recommend this Tea.
1070	5	Great product! I used this product as a supplement for my cat who was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and his body just could no longer tolerate processed cat food. I started him on a raw foot diet and used this product for a supplement because it contained turine. My cat had diarrhea so much so that his anal area was raw. I had to clean him up at least once a day, yuck, and he sure as heck didnt enjoy it either. Within a few days he was much improved and now is on total raw food diet and has more energy and is running around like a kitten(hes only 5 yrs old). I have my old cat back and he no longer stinks!!! Yea!!!
1071	5	I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!
1072	4	I like the cutting board it has rubber on the bottom so it doesn't slip and the groves help you cut the foods [kinda common sense but still helpful] The only qualm I have with the item was when I was cutting sweet potatoes it stained my board. I haven't tried anything to get it off yet, just soap.
1073	5	I have been taking Manuka Honey for several years. I am aware of it's healthful purpose. I am allergic to most medicines for a stomach problem and this works great to keep mine feeling normal. I like this brand because it is very cost affordable.
1074	5	and I want to congratulate the graphic artist for putting the entire product name on such a small box.  The ad men must have really thought long and hard.<br /><br />But seriously, I love the product. The taste was refreshing and I thought that the taste was pleasing with no aftertaste.  Not too sweet and Goldilocks would have stopped right there if there was a choice of 3.  Easy to use as you just pour the contents into a 16 oz bottle of water and shake.  Mixed well, no granulation, you really couldn't ask for anything more and Lipton like a good drug dealer knows what they are doing, give me a taste for free and have me for life.  5 stars.
1075	5	I have used this brand for my cats and they have liked it (different flavors of wet food including rabbit and duck). When it comes to treats, my two cats tend to have different taste. I got them these treats and they both liked them. The treats are about the size of a chicken nugget but they are very light and almost crumbly. They smell fishy to me but they are chicken. The directions say they are treats for dogs and cats and to give 1-2 for each 20 pounds. Since my cats are about 10lbs each I decided to split 1 between the two.<br />I have had a good experience with this brand and I recommend it.
1076	5	Have just started weaning my dog over to this new food, he seems to enjoy eating it and it smells good to him.
1077	5	These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.
1078	1	I ordered this product for my 6 year old grandson so he could have a fun snack for school since he is gluten intolerent.  Big mistake, this product is just awful. We thought it might be just Matty being fussy about the taste, but then I tried the product and I'll never do that again.  We all agreed, starting with my 2 year old grandaughter, that this candy is the very worse tasting candy any of us have ever had. I'm planning on returning the entire box. Do yourself a big favor and do not buy this product. There were no reviews when I purchased this candy, now I know why.
1079	1	My 15 month old says this tastes like dog food.  Actually, she's never had dog food, but if she did she would probably say,  Wow, this tastes like Sprout's roasted turkey with herbed vegetables! <br /><br />In all seriousness, it was really not good.
1080	5	She said it was def hot, but really really good. She said she had to cut it a little bit with v8 to cool it down, next time will buy org. for her.
1081	1	The name of this flavor sounds fantastic, and I wondered why they didn't include them in their multi-flavor assortment. Then I tasted them. These chips are terrible, there is no parmesan flavor to speak of, and they somehow messed up the garlic as well. Avoid these and the also-no-incuded-assortment flavor of  jalapeno . Very disappointed.<br /><br />The cheddar, vinegar & salt and peppered flavors are FANTASTIC!
1082	5	Timothy's Breakfast Blend is perfect for that  first  taste in the morning.  I just pop the k-cup into my Keurig coffee maker and, almost before my eyes are completely open, I have my coffee.  Then I'm ready to face the world!  I use it as my morning 'jump start' and my afternoon 'pick me up' boost.
1083	5	This tea is very flavorful.  Definitely does not need sugar as it has some inherent sweetness.  It makes for great iced tea with some honey.
1084	3	I've had Costa Rican caffeinated and liked it very much. I thought I would try the de-caffeinated version. It was not as good and shipping nearly doubled the cost.
1085	1	I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it. I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips. And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea. I actually like bitter black tea. This chai by stash isn't bitter so much as just plsin bad. I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. This tea has a terrible after taste i can't begin to describe. Like dirt or sour cinnamon. I like both cinnamon and cloves so i'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers. It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here. This box willbe going to work, annonously so no one knows it's from me! Or perhaps i should just throw it out. Don't like to be wasteful but I can't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this!
1086	5	The Bisquick Complete is great. I work and live overseas and ordering this product made life so simple to deal with after a hard day at the office.  The freshness and tender touch make anyone I serve them to appriciate the great taste.<br />Thank you for making this item one of the best on the market and for making my life a more simple one.
1087	5	Product is a good replacement for wheat flour. If you need a wheat free diet this flour will fit the bill. There are a lot of recipes on the net.
1088	5	WRIGLEYS FREEDENT WINTERFRESH GUM, IS ABSOLUTELY THE VERY BEST CHEWING GUM. WRIGLEYS IS APPARENTLY PHASING OUT THIS PARTICULAR FLAVOR. I LOOK FOR THIS GUM IN EVERY STORE I GO INTO WITHOUT ANY LUCK. SOMEONE MENTIONED LOOKING FOR THE GUM AT AMAZON. LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THAT  AMAZON WAS ABLE TO SUPPLY ME WITH THE  GUM. I BOUGHT 2 BOXES. BUT THE SHIPPING WAS SO EXPENSIVE THAT I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO CHANGE MY FLAVOR BECAUSE THE SHIPPING COST 1/3 OF THE COST OF THE GUM.
1089	5	Hard to beat this cocoa.  Taste great, and is non-fat.  Might even be good for you.
1090	5	I purchased this even though there were a lot of negative reviews. I think the coffee tastes great. I use the double pod holder and push the pod into it and brew. I've already ordered a second round.
1091	5	Oh my gosh!  Who knew a  chocolate  chip would taste so good.  The only bad part is I ate much more ice cream so I could dip them then before.
1092	4	This coffee has some chocolate flavor but is not strong. I will probably not purchase this flavor again. However, I will continue to try different flavors from this company, as I have purchased other flavored coffee from before that I found satisfactory.
1093	3	I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe.
1094	1	This is probably the worst gum I've ever had.  Since I unwittingly bought so much of it, I brought it to my workplace and shared it with no less than 10 fellow employees.  Nearly everybody thought it was disgusting, while some thought it was mediocre or bearable at best.<br /><br />I bought it because I don't really like mint gums and I tend to enjoy more fruit-flavored gums.  I was definitely let down.  It doesn't taste like strawberry shortcake.  It's a very unnatural, artificial taste that is very strong.
1095	5	These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected.
1096	5	Taste like carmels except softer.  Ingredients:  Sugar, Corn Syrup, Plant Stanol Estrs, Nonfat Milk, less than 2% of Caramel color, Soy lecithin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, and yellow 6.  Sodium 15 mg per chew or serving.  0.85 g of Plant Stanol Esters per chew.  2 per day recommended on package.  Expiration was about 14 months beyond the date I recieved so that was good.
1097	5	I love the bold taste of this coffee. I am not a coffee snob, but this is one of my favorite coffees of all time. Mahogany was the coffee I made at home, and was the main reason I waited so long to try the Kuerig. When I found these, I immediately ordered two boxes and a new Kuerig for the house. I was not disappointed at all, as the great taste still comes through strong....which does slow down my wife as it is a little stronger than we used to make it in the regular coffee pot. Well, the good news is I have found a coffee that she loves, Doughnut Shop, and one that I love, this one, and we can have them both at the same time.
1098	1	I am so disappointed with Felidae canned cat food (chicken and rice in chicken broth - MORE LIKE CHICKEN PASTE).<br /><br />I would normally feed a can a day to my foster cats and permanent cats and they would devour it.  Not any more, not since they turned this to a chicken-paste texture.<br /><br />And another thing....WHAT IS WITH THE FUNKY-SIZED CANS?  Did they even think how hard it is to find a cap that fits this.<br /><br />Guess I'll go back to Wellness - at least it's not paste.<br /><br />Did I tell you how disappointed I am?
1099	5	I tried Harney and Sons Green Tea and wasn't that excited by it. Then, I tried this flavor and really liked it. I would definately buy again even though its a bit more than I like to pay.
1100	5	We are VERY please with this product. My daughter is getting married and having a candy bar at the wedding. These blue gummy bears are perfect. Thanks!
1101	5	Bold strong coffee taste without sugar and milk.  Smooth and dark.  A real treat without extra calories. 152g of caffeine in the 6.8 oz. can is the perfect pick-me-up. Sip it slowly and enjoy!
1102	5	It is a joy to have some of our gum back that we had as kids. We would love to see old time candy brought back as well as gum.  Hopefully this will be available for a period of time.
1103	5	It has a nice taste: I've always liked Squirt as a kid.<br />The idea that it has vitamins as well is nice.<br />One can leaves me with a full feeling.<br />I tried my first one while it was still warm<br />after it arrived and it tasted good that way too.<br />I've tried mixing it with orange juice<br /> and that gives a refreshing drink as well.<br />I think it might make a good mixer with vodka.<br />It is a good drink for a hot day
1104	4	Despite its impressive health benefits , commerical green teas have left me cold.  At best, they are tasteless and blamd, at worst, oddly chemical with a grassy bite.  So my expectations were low when I tried this product.  Boy was I in for a surprise!  This tea was smooth and well balanced with them lemongrass and verbena enhancing instead of overpowering the subtly nuanced tea. It was relaxing and revitalizing.<br /><br />The twenty individualy wrapped tea bags come in an appropriately green box wiwth a perforated bottom.  The bax states that 165 mg of polypenols per serving.  an additional plus is Higgins' and burke's membership in the ethical tea partnership, an organization working for a responsible tea industry.  So it is good tasting, good for you and good for the industry.
1105	5	This stuff works great. I put a heaping tablespoon into 3 gal of mash and it finishes in about 4-5 days holding it at ~80F
1106	5	I have brewed Coopers Dark Ale, English Bitters and Irish Stout.  Much easier than the kits that require 1-3 hours of boiling. I simply add 4 pounds of everyday cane sugar, mix it with hot water from my coffee brewer, add 5 gallons of tap water and pitch the yeast. Sometimes it takes 1 week to brew, sometimes 2 weeks. I stopped using the hydrometer a long time ago. It's obvious when it's ready to bottle. I prime it with half a cup of cane sugar and bottle it in 2, 1, and 1.5 liter soda bottles. They work great. I also bottle some in the clear Mexican beer bottles and use my capper. Bottom line: Home brewed Coopers makes store bought beer taste like soda water.
1107	5	This classis Nescafe is better than each and every made-for-US-market freeze dried coffee brand, including Nestle's own. In Europe there is a better version: Nescafe Gold which is superior in taste, pure Arabica. I hope Amazon brings it here for us.
1108	5	This tea can taste good with or without sugar. You can taste the quality of the tea, I have purchased this tea a few times. I love this tea!
1109	5	My dog has been chewing these CET chews since she was about 2 years old. At age 9 now, she has minimal tarter and no 'dog breath'. She eagerly looks forward to her chew every morning!
1110	2	First of all, the pieces weren't as premium  Toro  part as product picture. What I received instead were less expensive  Akami  part, the part widely used for regular cheap Tuna Sashimi or Sushi in US. One of the piece were older than others judging by the color. I tasted one of the better piece as Sashimi and decided to cook the rest instead of taking them as Sashimi. It just wasn't worth it. My guess would be significant part of the price is for nice packaging and shipping. For those of you who has Whole Foods not too far, just make friends in their seafood section. Not officially but they can prepare sashimi tuna pieces for you better than this. They are still non-pemium  Akami  part but fresher and taste better than this and not to mention less expensive... Nice service for people have no access to decent seafood but this isn't for me...
1111	5	I have 2 rescue poodles which will eat just about anything that doesn't breathe.However I just don't feed them anything after a bitter lesson of my poodle Max dying from the China dogfood crisis.I will not feed them anything but totally USA made. They do like the chick/rice and I am about to give Turkey/rice a try.  I'm happy with it being mushy as easier for Spice to eat as she has only 1 tooth. I will continue to buy as long as they are happy with it.I'm so happy to have found it at Amazon with free shipping.
1112	1	is that the correct price 23.00 dollars for a 16 count of T disc when they cost 8.99 normally.. are you serious????
1113	4	Most flavored coffees have an underlying artificial taste, but surprisingly I could not detect any off notes to this Starbucks vanilla flavored coffee.  It had a natural taste of vanilla combined with that smooth taste that I associate with Starbucks coffee.  I would recommend this product line to those who want to try a good flavored coffee.
1114	5	I am very happy with this tea.  I hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags.  It is great tasting.  I add ginger chips to it and it really is great when I have an upset stomach.  I just recently received my second order.
1115	1	This is basically an assorted box of crap they couldn't sell whole boxes of. Pumkpin spice, spicy eggnog, wild mountain blueberry... only a few real coffee flavors. I thought it would be a good way to try out new flavors of coffee. I was wrong.
1116	5	This tea chest arrived quickly and is boxed nicely enough to give without wrapping.  I have not tasted all of these teas flavors but I do know that for myself all of the Wissotsky teas I have had have tasted wonderful and Wissotsky has definitely been the best brand I have purchased.  This gift is for someone who is Jewish and I know he will appreciated that the tea is from Israel and also Kosher.
1117	4	I love the To Go sticks that you simply mix in a bottle of water!  I've had many different brands and flavors over the years.  The Lipton To Go Iced Green Tea and Honey with Blackberry Pomegranate wasn't too bad.  Both of my kids (ages 6 and 7) wanted to try it too.  The 6 year old gave it a thumbs down but the 7 year old gave a thumbs up.<br /><br />The powder did not dissolve too well.  I shook and shook and shook but there was still some parts that were not dissolving (both in chilled and unchilled water.)  I also don't like that the instructions are to mix in an 16.9 oz container of water, but the serving suggestion and caloric information is all based on 8 oz (Why can't we keep things simple?)  Still at 10 calories for a 16.9 oz bottle of water, that isn't bad.  No fat, only 1 gm - per serving - of sugars.  The big plus for me is the 10mg of caffeine that it has per serving!  I can skip my afternoon coffee but still get that extra little lift to get me through.<br /><br />It also says that it is naturally sweetened with honey.  Which, yea, it has honey granuels in it, but it also has sucralose.<br /><br />Overall it is pretty good as a water enhancement powder.  I would buy in the future.
1118	5	What an amazing concept!<br />If you like REAL hot sauce that tastes great you will not be disappointed with this stuff.
1119	5	My puppy loves these treats and they are highly motivating when used during training.  They haven't affected her digestion system like cheese or hot dog bites did.  They are small and a few a day make her very happy!
1120	2	I subscribed and saved to this kind of jerky in the past, then had the subscription canceled for a time. Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it.
1121	3	I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with  natural mango flavor  taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again.
1122	4	I should start by saying that I am Bavarian and, although I moved to the US as a child, my mom continued cooking traditional Bavarian food for the rest of her life. I also do a lot of Bavarian cooking, including homemade Bavarian potato pancakes. When I have time, my favorite is still the way Oma (my mom) made them. The Panni (Pfanni in Germany) Potato Pancakes are an acceptable alternative that take a fraction of the time.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in the recipe for the real deal, just leave a comment here, and I'm happy to post it. As I said though, these here are a lot faster and an acceptable alternative. You'll also dirty up fewer dishes in making these than with the original recipe.<br /><br />Either way,  Moizeit! 
1123	5	Love this dip!  So good and easy, perfect for raw veggies.<br />It always is the first to go at parties.
1124	5	Good tasting alternative to other sugar free drinks.  Would probably be good as a cocktail, although I didn't try it that way.
1125	5	I have been using this product for years.  So easy to use.  Am not sure why it's so expensive on Amazon.  I get this same product/size at my grocers and pay $4.99 and I'm buying the Organic brand.  I didn't know how to rate this, so I rated it on the product itself.  It's such a convenience, but I'd never buy it here.
1126	5	I was sure that there was never a chip that I loved enough to give it 5 stars. But while traveling I bought a bag of these chips ($3.97 I might add) at a natural market type store and just loved them (other than the price).<br /><br />The chips themselves don't have a high oil or greasy taste that some enjoy, but the selection of spices and herbs that Garden of Eatin' has developed is just GREAT.<br /><br />I have bought three cases so far and just love them!
1127	3	It's a decent coffee, however I find it to be a little too strong to be called a  breakfast blend /medium blend. I guess if you're into bold coffee, it's fine. It's also more expensive than other K-cup varieties.
1128	5	I appreciated the solo review on this multivitamin.  I searched around amazon for a quality senior cat multivitamin.  I ordered this one just as a test to see if the older one, Mouse, would eat it.  They passed the test.  Flying colors.  He has a sensitive stomach and he, also, can be picky at times.  Yet, he seems to love this multivitamin, which is awesome because he is 10 years old and he could really used the extra good stuff.  I give this item a 5 out of 5, as well.
1129	1	This stuff smells bad,and looks worse. My cat will eat anything and is not finicky. She was hungry but wouldn't eat it. We disposed of it, and replaced it with another Newmans Chicken product. She disposed of it quickly. I now have 23 tins of useless stuff. Normally, I try before I buy in quantity, but I thought the brand would be safe.
1130	3	The tea itself is pretty good -- very smooth, sturdy flavor.  Not too much to say about that part.<br /><br />However, I hadn't entirely appreciated how much packaging was involved -- this is a big box of organdy (that is, cotton) teabags, each of which is sealed in a hefty plastic bag.  I was expecting something more modest and more readily recyclable.
1131	3	I like Stevita products and these are no exception. You don't have to worry about the ingredients, because everything is natural and there are no surprises here. The taste is good, albeit a little weak compared to similar  Aspartame  flavored products. However, when you do the math, you are paying approximately 70 cents per packet and this doesn't even include the price of the water. If you still want an all-natural drink mix that is less expensive, take a look at the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade. The product link is below.<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XG2H94 >True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade Drink Mix, 10-count (Pack of 6)</a>
1132	5	These dog treats are wonderful.  I have two Shelties and my daughter has two Shiba Inus.  All four just love these cookies.  All I have to say is  Cookie Time  and they come running. Thanks for a great product.
1133	4	I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to  pop  the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a  use by  date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.
1134	5	High quality, attractively packaged caramel popcorn. We give this to many friends and it is always a much appreciated gift. You can't go wrong on this purchase.  Fast shipping as always.
1135	5	Great size bag for the price! I am making a funfetti cake with just purple. These sprnkles/jimmies are exactly what I wanted. Although, the color could be darker.
1136	5	Nut 'n Honey is back! This was my favorite cereal in the 80's. They took it off the market, brought it back as Honey Nut Cornflakes, took it away again, and now brought it back. I don't know why they didn't revive the old name - it was a lot more memorable. Kellogg, please don't take it away, again.<br /><br />This is a very sweet cereal. It's closer to Frosted Flakes than Honey Bunches of Oats. Because it's sugar glazed it holds its crunch for the entire bowl. And the remaining milk is delicious to slurp!
1137	5	I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since. You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.
1138	5	We LOVE these pumpernickel and jalapeno pretzels.  You cannot find them where we live in Indiana so we bought them from Amazon.  The only negative thing we can share is that they are advertized as a 10 ounce bag-the bag is only 8 ounces.
1139	5	As a child growing up in the South, I was first introduced to Russell Stover Pecan Delights.  If you like caramel, pecans, and chocolate, then there is no better treat than these extraordinary sweet  delights. 
1140	2	This product does work. I have taken it multiple times. Every time I do take this 5 hour energy, I am more alive and aware.<br />It helps, but it makes me crash real bad at the end. It says no crash, but just last night when I took this, I couldn't keep my eyes open after taking it, I kept trying to stay awake, soon as I laid on my bed, at 9 pm. I woke up at 1 pm the next day. I missed the entire morning because I had crashed so unbelievably hard.<br /><br />I do not recommend this to everyone, everyone has a different reaction to it, but mine wasn't so good.<br />I suggest if you take these when  Not Tired  to avoid heavy crashes like mine. I took mine after being up for around 18 hours. So take them when you are only feeling a little worn out, not exhausted or restless.
1141	2	First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect.
1142	5	I have two dogs that love to destroy their stuffed animals. Looks like this one is going to last longer.
1143	4	They're very delicious, so much so that you have to resist eating them all in one sitting.  I ate them over two days.<br /><br />But how healthful are they? They're marketed as healthful. Organic. No artificial colors or flavors.  That's all good.<br /><br />My biggest sticking point is that the ingredients list corn syrup. Perhaps that's not as bad as high fructose corn syrup, but I still don't think corn syrup is too healthful.  That's why I'm deducting a star.<br /><br />Here's a full list of ingredients:  Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Corn Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Vegetable Glycerin, Sunflower Oil, Elderberry Extract, Citric Acid, Natural Flavor, Pomegranate Juice Concentrate, Licorice Root Extract.<br /><br />Serving size: 5 pieces.  130 calories per serving.  (That's 26 calories per twist.)<br /><br /> About 3.5  servings per container.<br /><br />They taste good, if you don't mind the sugar and corn syrup.
1144	1	I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion.
1145	2	I literally almost throw up everytime I open the bag. I figured I'd give these a shot because they are all natural blah blah blah. My dog doesn't seem to care for these over any other treat and the only difference to me isother treats don't make me gag! I'm sticking to beggin strips.
1146	5	These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags.
1147	4	Mrs. May's bar tastes great and I have them before tennis or during a round of golf. Works well for me. The only thing is the size of the bar offered through Amazon is smaller than the size from Costco. Be aware of that!
1148	4	It's an interesting marketing ploy. If you get bad reviews then call it something else.  That said, it does seem to help with high altitude.  And it's the only coca tea I could find.
1149	5	These do not ATTRACT flying insects. When used near a light source or an area when flying insects are buzzing around, they work great. I have an issue in my area with those TINY no-see-ems that get right through regular windows screens. They buzz around my computer monitors and are generally a PITA. I hang these traps right under my desklamp and under my ceiling light.  The little buggers fly into or land on them. Problem solved!
1150	3	I love Tully's Italian Roast. It is my favorite of all the robust coffees available. I bought this 50 pack and when it arrived there was a note that it was  outdated.  I was given the opportunity to return it for a refund, but I don't have time to fool around with returns unless absolutely necessary.  This coffee was good enough to keep, but no where as good as it usually is. The coffee is excellent, but the company from whom I purchased this should have not sent me outdated coffee. Obviously, I will never by from this company. I will, however, continue to buy good Tully's Italian Roast.
1151	5	This is my all time favorite hard candy.  I haven't been able to find it anywhere for about 2 years now.  I am so thrilled, I got a huge supply at a great price!
1152	5	I had this sent as a gift. They loved it and said it was beautiful and everything delicious. Also loved the cutting board.
1153	5	This product is AWESOME!  My mother's dog has to take pills for the rest of her life, and it's always such a chore to try and get her to take them.  Now all we do is pop the pills in a Greenies Pill Pocket and she eats them right up!  I think they smell kind of awful, but the dog loves them!
1154	5	I bought this as part of my quest for adding healthy but tasty things to my diet.  More fruit is always good, except for the sugars of course, and I've read that cherries may help relieve muscle aches and prevent gout.<br /><br />I was surprised at how sweet and tasty this concentrate is, just from the natural sugars.  I've experimented with mixing it into <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015VVS2M >Acai Juice</a> to increase the fruit juice percentage and the variety of antioxidants.  I've also experimented with mixing it into <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052UGUP2 >protein chocolate pudding</a>.
1155	5	Very delicious and wonderful tea -- a little more bitter than I am used to but still great.  It won't last long!
1156	5	I like the taste of these.  They are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. They are delicious at only one hundred calories and I can't say that about many other snacks. They come individually wrapped and I like to throw a couple into my purse for sudden hunger pangs after my gym workout.<br /><br />They are made with real blueberries and have none of the artificial taste some other snack products can have. They are very filling. I have been using this as my one snack of the day that doesn't involve fruit or other natural foods. If I need something fast each day, usually late afternoon, one of these takes care of me.<br /><br />Here are the nutritional facts from the side of the box for one box:<br /><br />Calories from Fat 15<br />%daily value<br />Total Fat 1.5g<br />Saturated Fat 0.5g<br />3%<br />Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 115mg5%<br />Total Carbohydrate 18g6%<br />Dietary Fiber 2g8%<br />Sugars 8g<br />Protein 2g<br />Vitamin A<br />0%<br />Vitamin C<br />0%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron<br />2%<br />Folate<br />2%<br /><br />Now for the bad part.<br />I will not continue to buy these, as tasty and convenient as they are, due to the fact that they contain high fructose corn syrup which is an ingredient I try to avoid.<br />Studies have linked it to type II diabetes. I also try to avoid palm oil, another unhealthy ingredient in these. I will throw an apple in my purse for a snack from now on.
1157	5	I recently bought a bag of Michoko Carmel Candies when I was in Paris as a gift for the girls I work with. I wish that I had opened the bag and tried one before bringing it back to the US. This candy is fantastic and had I known this I would have brought home a suitcase full.  My co-workers loved them and the bag was gone before noon. I must now order them and have them shipped. If you like dark chocolate and caramel try a bag of Michoko Caramel Candies.
1158	5	This organic beef is by far my cat's favorite can food.  He gobbles it down instantly, which is not true with any other can cat food I give him.  I don't use this everyday (about every 3 or 4 days) because I like to feed a variety of foods to Butch.  I also feed him dehydrated raw food, but at a separate time from the can.
1159	5	It used to be a pain giving my dog two pills twice a day. With pill pockets, I fill several days worth at a time, so medicine time is quick and easy. Now I just grab one, and say  Medicine time , and he comes running.
1160	5	Almost taste like black tea. Very nice tea, but what is better than other tea is that this Pu-erh tea doesn't upset your stomach like black or green tea does to me.  I am glad to have found this tea.
1161	5	I gave this to my mom for her birthday last year, 2009.  What a HIT it was!  She laughed & giggled over the candy inside.  Several minutes later, she was on the phone to her friends to brag about her cool candy gift.  A few of the items she didn't remember, but didn't care.  She either ate them or gave those away.<br /><br />Just do NOT order this item in the summer time.  If you have to, pay the extra for fastest shipping.  I didn't & the item arrived late August, about 20 days before my mom's birthday in September.  I stored it in the fridge til her birthday because I knew some of the candy would be melted or close to it.  Thank goodness I did too.  There was more chocolate candy inside than I expected.
1162	5	This coffee is superb with a mild earthy flavor and freshness that are worth the price. I will definitely purchase more in the future.
1163	5	O-M-G...what can I say?  These are the absolute best bars I've ever had!  They are LOADED with coconut and nuts but, most of all, FLAVOR!!!  Gluten free to boot (though that doesn't matter to me), but someone that it does make a difference to...I encourage you to treat yourself to these...chewy, chewy, chewy and so flavorful...did I mention, chewy?!?!  The more you chew the more flavor you taste...just the right amount of honey, NOT the bland old sawdust granola bar you may think of...get them!!!
1164	5	We got this for the parentals and it's fantastic!! I love the box it is so cute and comes with a little booklet telling you about the 50's! So cool! Thank you!! Great DEAL!! Worth it totally and cool to see what the 50's candies were like! All the candy was in the box, I dbl ck'd. Also all the candy is intact and not smashed and seem fresh. And I found mine on Amazon for $20.99 + FREE shipping. :) Happy Holidays!
1165	5	I bought a Keurig brewer last Christmas and have been sampling all the different varieties. I enjoy being able to have a variety of good fresh coffee on hand. I like the darker roasts like French and the 'Jet Fuel' brand which is a good roast. This Italian Roast is my absolute favorite, strong and full of flavor. :) I am ordering another box of 50 today.
1166	5	Thanks for the convenience or purchasing the fiesta nacho cheese.  I do believe I ordered one day and it appeared the next.
1167	1	I bought both the PB2 & the Chocolate PB2.  I am pretty disappointed in the chocolate.  It has neither a strong chocolate nor a strong peanut butter flavor.  Not worth the money.
1168	5	It shipped quickly, arrived in great condition and instructions that came with the plant were very helpful
1169	4	This is a sweet BarBQ sauce what is good for most anything. I haven't tried it on fish yet, but it works with everything else. A good price as well and it comes in a goodly quantity. Try it, you'll probably like it.
1170	5	Chamomile Nights Tea from Stash is delicious and very relaxing. Wonderful way to end the day! I have had trouble finding it in stores, but Amazon carries it in stock and has a great price. Thank you, Amazon!
1171	5	Loved it! Worked great for my son. No colic and no spitting up. I recommend this product to anyone Who has a fussy baby.
1172	4	This tea is good. I would not say it is perfect but it is good. The flavor and aroma is good. Try it yourself. You may like it too. Thank you!!
1173	5	We LOVE these chews.  They clean our teeth and help to keep our breath fresh.  They are cheaper here than at the vets office so we are happy.  Mom saves money and we get treats.<br /><br />Misty, Jasmine and Pandora
1174	5	I had been searching for this product that was not available in my area.  It came quickly and as advertised.
1175	5	This is the best sugar substitute for me. it tastes and disolves like real sugar. I have tried Stevia and it leaves me with a bitter aftertaste. Amazon offers this product at a good price and rapid delivery.
1176	5	This is the real deal, not some cheap coffee products that only wants to make a buck from you.  I can see that Kilambe Coffee really knows and cares about what us coffee lovers want.  Try it!
1177	5	Love this coffee,  buy it all the time, You can't go wrong with this one!!!!
1178	5	I received this little beauty as a gift, and I couldn't be happier with it! The plant is healthy, robust, and despite my best attempts, has survived my 'green thumb!'
1179	5	After 8 months of trial and error we finally found Royal Canin Special Formula 33, the only food that works for our cat with severe gastrointestinal problems (per the recommendation of our vet).  Special Formula 33 has allowed us to keep our cat healthy, saved our carpets and allowed us to breath without asking  what is dead and rotting!? 
1180	1	I had to throw the whole case out.<br /><br />I'm not unusually sensitive, but they are so high in hydrolyzed vegetable protein (the ingredient-list euphemism for MSG) that even a small amount used as seasoning was enough to set off a major 24-hour case of  Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.  Not worth the risk.
1181	4	I am not one for  canned  juice drinks, but this one was exceptional in flavor. I am also not a big fan of orange flavored drinks but the tangerine is distinctive and nice.  It kind of reminded me of one of my favorite soft drinks in the world, Ting (from Jamaica) which is made from real grapefruit juice. Very nice, if you need more Vitamin C in your life I would consider buying it.
1182	5	This honey just tastes great. You can feel the propolis and it does not feel as sweet as filtered honey.
1183	2	My dogs have not been too hard to please with food.  They will eat almost anything, but they have little interest in the 3 cases of this stuff I bought.  Maybe I should add something to it like salt?
1184	5	Old School cinnamon toothpics in bulk quantity, Yay!  The concept is simple but effective--These are made of a wood slightly softer (and much more absorbant) than the regular plain boxes of round toothpicks, and soaked in STRONG cinnamon oil.  The resulting flavor is VERY strong cinnamon often resulting in numb tongue/lips, DO NOT confuse these with those wimpy so-called  flavored  round toothpicks passed out in fancy-schmancy resteraunts.<br /><br />We used to buy these at the liquor store across from school in 5-piece packs (I lived in a terrific neighborhood).  I vividly remember chewing on these in High School during certain classes to stay awake.  For some reason, a toothpick was tolerated where gum or a tootsie pop was not.  The flavor was so good (STRONG) for so long, I would often end up chewing these things to a nice, woody pulp. MMMmmm!  Against my nature, I am going to resist commenting on cinnamon toothpicks as a source of dietary fiber.  For those saddled with droning teachers or co-workers, know that it is simply not possible to fall asleep with something as hot as these toothpicks in your mouth.  In college, I found them useful in finally breaking my nail biting habit.  Wood pulp, thankfully, is non-addictive.  Offer one to a non-suspecting friend and watch their eyes light up along with their tongue! :)
1185	4	This chip is one of our family favorites to dig into chili, guac, or other hearty (meaning thicker) foods.<br />Unfortunately Amazon has taken it off the subscribe-n-save, so off to the local grocery store during sales...
1186	5	I am so excited to see that HappyBaby has cereal now!  My daughter loves their frozen organic baby food!  Plus the packaging is sooooo much better than the boxes 'other' cereals come in.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!
1187	4	Decent value for the quantity.  The candy arrived fresh and was exactly what I expected.
1188	5	I love this Nestle hot chocolate but have only been able to find it in the supermarkets for about $3.69 for eight servings.  When I came across these canisters at this great price, I immediately ordered it.<br /><br />It's a satisfying hot chocolate which has only 25 calories and comes out to just pennies a serving.  I highly recommend it.
1189	5	Received product quickly.<br /><br />This is an excellent alternative in all recipes I've incorporated for real eggs.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
1190	4	The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it. The shipping is fast and cost is reasonable.<br />I recommend this product.
1191	5	I ordered  Nido  because my old favorite,  Milkman , is no longer being made. Now Nido is my new favorite! It mixes with water more easily than Milkman dry milk powder, & has a richer taste, too.
1192	5	I bought this for a movie party and the kids just loved them.  My son also has a peanut allergy and this candy is made in a peanut free factory.
1193	3	To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again.
1194	5	Okay I am a soda drinker in some cases 1 litter a day plus. Then sodastream came across my tv screen. I was like okay it sounds great.When I found this my local store and saw the price for the unit. I said wow that is a big jump $130 plus to just buy the unit then you gotta buy the charging cartridges  co2  and bottles then the syrup all told it was near 200 to get me started and ready to go. So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull
1195	5	Out of all powdered lemonade drink mixes, this one tastes the closest to freshly squeezed. It's delicious! I love the 2 quart size pouches. The zipper closures are perfect. It is a very sweet product but it has a good amount of tartness to help balance it. I half expect to find pulp in my cup, it tastes that good!
1196	1	I love making pumpkin pie, pumpkin bread, and pumpkin pudding during the autumn months.  I never tried Polar Pumpkin until last week.  I'll never try it again.  I chose Polar because it's cheaper than Libby's, but I got what I paid for.  I noticed a strange chemical smell coming from the pumpkin as soon as I opened the can.  I tasted just a little and gagged.  Knowing what canned pumpkin should taste like, I threw out the cans of Polar Pumpkin.  Nasty!  I'll stick with Libby's - learned my lesson.
1197	1	Goji berries CAN be very tasty and enjoyable, however this is not how I would describe Navitas goji berries.<br /><br />I bought a bag once, from Amazon, and found the berries to be nearly rock hard and absolutely dry.  The only good part about it was that they sorta tasted ok after chewing on them a while.<br /><br />If you want really, really good goji berries get Heaven Mountain brand.<br /><br />They cost twice as much as these, but these aren't really worth anything, in my opinion.<br /><br />These are the best and well worth the price:  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EBEKU >Bija  Heaven Mountain Goji Berries 8-Ounces</a><br /><br />Do it right or don't do it!
1198	3	When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a  10-pack  has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella.
1199	4	Not much to say about these really, but they are my preferred PB cracker brand and the price is awesome for the amount you get.  The only reason for docking a star is the expiration date on these is usually far too soon.  It is hard to eat this many crackers in the short time frame they are good for, but that does vary with your order.
1200	5	This is my favorite coconut water, and I think I've tried almost all of them at this point (fresh is always best, but that's expensive and hard to come by). I first found Taste Nirvana in California, in the smaller glass bottles, and loved it, but couldn't find it after returning to MD. Then I found them on Facebook and subsequently on Amazon, and I have been subscribed to 2 cases per month ever since (and am upping to 3 cases). The glass one may or may not taste better, but this is a larger container and is far cheaper. Now the stores near me carry this brand, but it's still cheaper to get on Amazon, and the plain, no-pulp cans are still not available near me.
1201	5	I have purchased this exact product elsewhere & have yet to find this great of a deal! Nutiva tastes & smells amazing!! I truly appreciate the option to  auto ship  too.  I use this oil from cooking, to hair care, to skin care...love it!
1202	5	Just to clear up any confusion, contrary to the previous comment posted at the end of July 2009, there is simply a total of 288 sticks of gum (i.e., equivilant to 144  cups of coffee ) contained in this two-box pack of Jolt Gum.<br /><br />Put another way, there are 12 pieces of gum per blister pack, twelve blister packs per box, and with 2 boxes provided . . . you will end up with a total of 288 pieces of gum. Once again, it takes two (2) pieces of gum to equal one (1)  cup of coffee ; thus, this purchase is equivalent to 144 cups of coffee.<br /><br />Amazon's price is very good considering you may purchase it directly from joltgum . com for seventeen dollars per SINGLE box.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to point out is that the precise content of caffeine in each stick of gum is 40mg.  Thus, each two-stick serving which they call the equivalent of  one cup of coffee  is really equal to only 80mg of caffeine.  Yes, I do realize that the reason they don't fully disclose the caffeine content, unless you really dig that is, is because they also have Ginseng & Guarana in the gum which they claim is makes up the  energy equivalent  between the caffeine contained in the gum and the typical caffeine-only value of a typical coffee.<br /><br />Just to put it in comparison, a typical shot of espresso (44-60 mL [1.5-2 U.S. fl oz]) contains 100mg of caffeine.<br /><br />Regardless of my slight issue with the somewhat lack of transparency on the product's labeling regarding caffeine content, I still would HIGHLY recommend this gum!!
1203	5	I absolutely love this stuff -- the mesquite lime flavor is sweet, spicy and tangy, and the consistency of the jerky is chewy yet moist. At 74 calories and 10 grams of cholesterol-free meatless protein, you can't beat it as a snack.
1204	2	This flavor is the only kind of pouch my baby girl likes. I used to order the 3.5 pouch. now she's 14 months old, I decided to order the bigger pouch.. However.. they sent me the 3.5 ounce pouch instead. I didn't bother to return it and order again... I thought people make mistakes sometimes. But I see other reviewers having the same problem... I hope they send me the right one this time because I just ordered.. if not... I would think they are doing this on purpose.. and they have a problem.
1205	5	Just enough dark chocolate to make it tasty but not too sweet.<br />Crunchy-crisp at the same time it is chewy. For most food that's a sin. That usually is a signal to run from high fat, salt, calories, and sweetness.<br />Bottom line, it's as reasonably healthy as any similar snack, even those put out by the diet conglomerates that charge weekly, monthly, and per package fees.<br />Now if I can just get over considering just how delightful it surely would be over a large bowl of ice-cream.<br /><br />Want the numbers? Here's The Box Facts:<br />Nutrition for one 27g bar<br />Cal 110; Cal from Fat 25; Total fat 3g; Sat Fat 1.5g; 0 trans and polyunsat fat; chol 0; sodium 85mg; Total Carb 17g; Dietary fiber 4g; Sugars 7g; Protein 4g<br /><br />Contains soy, wheat, milk, almond and peanut ingredients, for those who need to know.<br />Exchange: 1 Carbohydrate, ½ fat; Am Dietetic Assoc & Am Diabetes Assoc.<br /><br />Ingredients: soluble corn fiber, rolled oats, isolated soy protein, sugar, cereal (rice, whole grain wheat, sugar, wheat bran, soluble wheat fiber, salt, malt flavoring, vitamin B1 (Thiamin Mononitrate), Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Fructose, semisweet chocolate (Chocolate, sugar, dextrose, soy lecithin, and/or partially hydrogenated palm kernel, palm, canola and/or coconut oil?, corn syrup, chicory cocoa (processed with alkali), chocolate sorbitol, lecithin, salt, polysorbate 60, sorbitan monostearate, niacinamide, BHT (preservative), almond flour, peanut flour, distilled monoglycerides, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), reduced iron.<br /><br />It is a satisfying snack for me, a two heart attack survivor on a controlled diet and joining my wife in trying to eat healthy, exercise, and enjoy life fully. The box says there is also a chocolaty peanut butter variety. My 5-bar box has a remaining shelf life of about 6 months--like that will ever happen.
1206	1	I tried these mints and found the aroma to be wonderful. The taste however leaves something to be desired. I found it too much like eating something dunked in perfume. The aftertaste was also a bit unpleasant. Not something I will purchase again.
1207	5	thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips.
1208	5	Wonderful! I have a busy job that keeps me occupied with little time to take meal breaks. I take a couple pieces of this and some fruit and veggies, and I get to have healthful snacks instead of relying on fast food or candy bars. Helped me lose 20 (and counting) pounds!
1209	5	This is a great gift item. A good-looking woven basket, with non-perishable, good tasting food treats. All this at a good price. Loved it!
1210	5	Who knew instant coffee could taste like this? Since discovering good fresh-roasted coffee 30 years ago, I have never considered instant as an option. Then I tried Via decaf in the store, and I've been hooked ever since. The decaf Italian roast is delicious, and I take the handy little packets everywhere with me, in case there's no other tasty coffee option. Two thumbs-up!
1211	5	I have to say that if you are a fan of the energy drink with the initials R B (moo) then you will be a HUGE fan of this. The flavor is a perfect match. I am so hooked that I will never spend a dime in the store for the name brand again.
1212	5	I bought this item and a couple of others to try after being introduced to them at a friend's part. I cannot tell you how good they taste - you seriously cannot tell that they're sugar free. I've tried various products in the past, but Go Cocktails has perfected this formula for margarita! - And thank goodness cause Baja Bob's was not as good and left you with an aftertaste.
1213	5	This popcorn oil is the best for popping corn anywhere.  I have used it at home in my PopStir (similar to WhirleyPop) on the stovetop and at school functions in a commercial popcorn popper. If you use this oil, you probably won't even have to add any butter to the popcorn after it's popped - so no cholesterol and less fat.  A special feature of this product: It will NOT form black  varnish  inside or outside of your kettle - be it a commercial machine or a home version - it is a clean oil.  This oil is solid at room temperature, and you will need some sort of scoop (as an ice cream or cookie scoop) to measure it out of the container.  This oil gives popcorn the fragrance, taste and COLOR of commercially popped theater popcorn. You won't regret your purchase of this item.
1214	5	This is unlike the concentrates that I've ever tried. I like the taste and ease to use. It has concentrated sugar that adds a real nice flavor. As you can tell in the ingredients listed on the product page it has vitamin C listed third, behind water and critic acid. Also a natural form of caffiene, B3 and B6. These provide a pick me up to me after consuming a couple of 8 oz glasses with ice. The bottle is enough to last me about a month, when drinking about 8 oz a day on average. it comes in handy when I run out of soda or don't want a cup of coffee. The amount of natural caffiene is low and does not give me a nervous or jittery type feeling. I use a little less than the suggested amount because of my taste due to the fact that I prefer less sweet drinks.<br /><br />The price is good, and the Subscribe and Save brings it down another 15%. The bottle fits easy into my hand and the cap is sturdy enough to hold upside down and shake without spilling a drop. I would recommend this product as a semi energy drink or a replacement for Kool-aid, as it does have some valuable vitamins.
1215	5	This nut-milk bag is very thick and strains my blended fruits & veggies without much work.  I do not use it for making homemade nut milks, though.  So I'm not sure how it strains processed nuts for the milk.  But it is a wonderful alternative to flat cheese cloths.
1216	5	Purchased this for my Keurig coffee maker. Excellent tea at an excellent price for 48 K-cups. Will definitely re-order in the future.
1217	4	This is pretty nice to use when you are making smoothie.  It's pre-sweetened, so I don't use extra sugar.  It's delicious with banana, strawberry, blueberry and even with chocolate!
1218	3	I have been feeding my Goldendoodle this type of food for a few months and his skin conditions have been improving. I decided to give this food a try because of the high content of fatty acids which are good for skin, but the smell from the dog is just too much. I first started feeding him outside, then leaving him out a few minutes after eating, but now, it is just too much, he doesn't even have to be panting or having his mouth open to smell that awful scent. He does poop 2 or 3 times a day and they are medium size stools.<br />I like the brand, but I think I'll try lamb or chicken now and supplement him with vitamins.
1219	5	Not only was this beautifully packaged and delicious but it came in a cold styrofoam pack in one day! Wonderful!
1220	5	can't review this fairly - i am addicted to these.. They are SOOOO good with that spicy ginger taste!
1221	5	I have been an olive oil snob ever since I tried this oil in a health food type store, years ago.  I have only been able to find it at that store. Our Company has since moved and we are no longer near the store so I cannot locate a lot of the wonderful products I used to take for granted being in Brooklyn NY.  This is like liquid gold.  I could drink it, its fruity and light and very tasty.  Add lime and a touch of sea salt and put an any and everything!!!.  Years ago I paid $12.99 a bottle, so I guess this price is OK. I also prefer Colavita's Il Numerato, which is also impossible to find.
1222	5	My daughter has life threatening food allergies, so it's important we have safe dried foods she can eat in case of emergency. That said, I think she would eat these daily if I let her! Very tasty and packed with nutrients. Although my preference on a daily basis is whole fresh fruit, this is great as a back up for her. Best of all, it's organic, no added sugar or preservatives, and it's gluten free.
1223	5	My cat was allergic to something in most canned cat foods.<br />This one has none of the mixtures of other meats mixed with<br />the tuna. Best of all - he loves it.
1224	1	Be careful when ordering.  The package I received was not air-vacuum sealed like previous orders.  As a result, the contents were comprimised, creating a rancid smell and bitter taste.  After one teaspoon I was forced to discard the entire contents of my 3-pound bag, which resulted in a complete waste of money.  Amazon does not allow returns for this product.  Buyer BEWARE.
1225	5	I have been looking for just a pain black tea with no flavors.  I finally found it.  I think it is my favorite tea. Not crazy about the flavored teas.  I use it for both iced tea and hot tea.
1226	4	Our two-year-old son was diagnosed  failure to thrive  at nine months old and shortly after diagnosed with eosiniphilic esophagitis.  He has major allergies to egg, dairy, peanuts, several tree nuts and a mild wheat allergy.  He was getting all these things through my milk and his body was unable to get nutrients from it.  With the help of treatment, food avoidance, and Bright Beginnings as his major calorie source he has not only gained weight but grown substantially and is now  thriving. <br />We live in a very small town where we have to travel nearly an hour to the nearest store that carries the Bright Beginnings drink.  Last month I ordered it for the first time from this source and while paying only for normal postage had it delivered to my door the next day for the same cost as driving the distance to the store to buy it.  I am thrilled to now have this easy method of ordering so I don't need to worry about running out anymore.
1227	1	This is for the regular flavor...<br />I give it zero starts, it was so bad.<br />Hard to believe this is food, and really hard to believe all of the good reviews.  I felt like I was eating packing material, and it left a slimy, yucky residue in my mouth.  Totally disgusting.  BBQ Stix are way better!
1228	5	I do not eat gluten, so it was important to me that this product be non-gluten.  I looked the package over and nowhere did I see  without gluten  on it, except in the ingredients where it lists the whole grains used to make this product, it did say  gluten free oats  but still I wondered about the other grains.  Another ingredient was amaranth, which has no gluten (neither do oats, but they easily become contaminated by gluten in processing) so I checked this site and lo and behold, it says that it is non gluten!  So, not on the package (unless I am missing it?) but yes, on this site.<br /><br />I took this bag of granola with me to my daughter/husband's house and they tried it too.  It was a very nice tasting cereal, loaded with whole grains.  I did not experience what some other reviewers said, with having no clusters in their bag (in other words, some got kind of a granola dust, but mine were big chunks, just like they are supposed to be).  Mine was packed in a box with some of those air pocket things, so it came through just fine.  I also didn't notice any funny aftertaste.  The cost is $16.56 for 3, 11 oz bags, or $14.08 through  subscribe and save  ($4.69 per bag).  I think this is a little higher than our local Walmart Bear Naked granola, but not that much higher.  Also, Bear Naked granola isn't gluten free (the oats are not gluten free, to my knowledge), whereas the Kind variety is.<br /><br />Although the variety of this cereal that I had (Cinnamon and Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds) did not have glycerin as an ingredient, I noticed that my bag of Bear Naked fruit and nut granola did have glycerin, apparently with the raisins and cranberries that were in it.  I have to admit, I had always associated glycerin with soap (like Neutrogena) but note too that nitroglycerin (an explosive) has glycerin.  Glycerin is also, apparently, a sweetener (probably why they use it with raisins and cranberries).<br /><br />In the end, I would say that if you like the taste of this granola, the price on this one isn't bad.  And taste is a matter of, um, taste.  Because it is non-gluten, I may just buy this instead of the Bear Naked granola that I usually buy (yes, I know that Walmart's Bear Naked granola isn't non-gluten, but I like it and it is cheap and for reasons that I do not understand, I do not have to absolutely abstain from gluten, although I usually do).  I would definitely give this granola a chance and if you like the flavor, go for it!
1229	5	NatraTaste is a very good sugar for me while Splenda and Equal cripple my muscles which makes them hard to get up of the bed in the morning. I don't have that problem with NatraTaste which is supposed to be the same kind of sugar.
1230	5	I have a Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market only a short drive away and I buy a lot of groceries there. It's an English company ant they have a lot of exotic items that you generally don't find elsewhere, including English candies. So, I pick one up ever so often. One of the latest is a Toffee Crisp crispy crunch chewy munch bar. Mmmmm. It's good, Nice chocolate coating on the outside and both chewy and crunchy on the inside. Wonderful taste too. My wife says European candies are better than American and she's right!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
1231	5	As a working professional in NYC I rarely have time to eat breakfast.  Normally it would be some greasy fast-food egg sandwich or street cart muffin/donut.  Trying to become a bit more health-conscious, I decided to give these a try.  These are FANTASTIC for a quick and easy on-the-go breakfast.  Just grab one as you're heading out the door.  Only 12 grams of natural fruit sugars, (the kind of sugars you don't mind.) 0 fat and only 60 calories per pouch, and of course, most importantly, they taste great!
1232	5	My mother used Watkins vanilla and I still remember that awesome smell in our house.  It's been many years since that time and haven't had access to the Watkins products.  However, as I was surfing Amazon's grocery items, I came across Watkins vanilla and immediately ordered a bottle.  It was safely packaged and I used it that afternoon in a chocolate pie.  Yes, I was very pleased with the flavor and aroma and plan to keep it on hand from now on.
1233	5	Simply Delicious!<br /><br />A taste of the highlands, easy to make, and great for any occasion! This is my 5th order, this time I used it to stuff a turkey!
1234	3	I like the chocolate and I like the pseudo-peanut butter taste but ultimately a granola bar survives by the quality of the granola. With this granola bar, it feels like the chocolate is merely there to cover up the fact that the granola is possessed of too much natural fiber without the taste that granola should have. It's pretty sub-par granola.<br /><br />These are ok snacks but I like other granola bars better.
1235	4	Most everyone in Britain knows this candy. I myself grew up eating 'em. The only warning would be that they are highly addictive. They are quite hard, requiring some chewing and do have a habit of sticking to your teeth.<br />Otherwise; I'd highly recommend them!
1236	5	Barbara's Multigrain Wheat Free Fig Bar is the BEST wheat free cookie I have eaten ( and I have tried many!) They are moist and have a delightful flavor - much better than even the other brand name fig bars made With wheat!  Barbara's other wheat free fig cookie with raspberry is just as delectable! I buy a case every 3 months from Amazon and with the automatic shipment discount, the price can't be beat!
1237	5	I Bought these & they came in Saturday, I put a small bowl out for a get together & everyone was asking where i got them, they're delicious! I'd definitely recommend people to buy these!
1238	5	This is one of our favorite coffee flavors ... the nice thing is that it isn't over priced like many other brands.  We have paid as much as $17 or more for less than a pound of coffee.  2 lbs for around the same price ... no comparison.
1239	5	I have not tried this product personally, but my dog has, and he loves it, and is aging well. He's getting a bit grey, but is as bouncy as he ever was 10 years ago.
1240	5	My mom, who has always believed that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, approved of this product for her kids as a good substitute, ever since it first came out. In recent years, she's lost a lot of weight, and has become a very picky eater. When she refuses to eat what's on hand, she's given a glass of this - she also likes it at nighttime. Strawberry is her favorite, and has become nearly impossible to find, except in some variety packs (why??). I'm thrilled and grateful that Amazon carries it, and hope it continues to do so - I'll definitely continue to buy it!
1241	5	This is a perfect size snack, delicious and healthy.  But I'm biased, I love nuts!
1242	5	I used to order a bag of these every 2 weeks or so and they were always awesome.  There was a period recently of about 3 months where these minifrogs had a terrible smell and taste that was unbearable.  I think I returned 4 or 5 bags. It must have been a distributor issue.  I started ordering other HARIBO products...all great!  I stopped ordering these Mini Frogs for about 2 months and finally decided to try them again...AMAZING!  Just like I remembered them.  Lets hope they stay this way.  Have another bag on my doorstep waiting for me now.  Cant wait to get off of work!
1243	4	You get a foam cup full of dried noodles, vegetables and little bits of beef. Fill with boiling water to the line on the inside of the cup, wait 3 minutes, stir and you have lunch. Its not gourmet food but it will save you from spending 6 bucks at the deli for a sandwich. The instructions say that microwaving is not recommended. I fill mine from the hot water spigot on the spring water dispenser here at work. Our coffeemaker has a hot water dispenser too. Accompany this with an apple and call it lunch. :)
1244	3	I bought these for baking and once they arrived, realized that they were not the baking kind of fruit at all. I guess I just did not pick up on the  Crispy  detail in the title. I thought they were just your average dried fruit that I could cut up and put in breads and cakes, but they are certainly not that, so do not make the same mistake with them that I did.<br />Otherwise, they are pretty nice. Now, as you might guess, I am an adult. So once I realize that I had a snack item on my hands, I decided to try it out in that capacity. That is where I became disenchanted with this product to some extent. The little packages of pears are not NEARLY enough for a snack for an adult. I have to eat 3 of them to feel like I got a snacks worth, and I am not a heavy eater. A whole candy bar is too much. A whole pear is almost too much, but these little packages are just not enough. The package says it holds the equivalent of one pear. My guess is, that these are mighty small pears.<br />They are nice and sweet though. That is the biggest positive about this item. The taste is GREAT. I really do like that part.<br />One reviewer mentioned that these tend to crumble easily and they do. About an eight of the product is at the bottom of the bag in a mess of crumbs. That is a disappointing factor. Since I had expected dried fruit, I guess I also expected that these snacks had a little more body to them than they do. The big pieces that hold together are quite good, but an awful lot of the product ends up at the bottom of the bag.<br />I finally gave these 3 stars. They taste good, but there is just not nearly enough product. It crumbles. It is an awful big package with very little in it. I would say that this is a snack for a 5 or 6 year old and not for an adult.<br />Well, that is my two cents on this product. Hope it helps you decide to buy or forgo. I will opt for regular dried pears myself. This is kind of an expensive hassle just to avoid eating the real fruit.
1245	5	My husband is just crazy about these chips!  This is a great deal and they are so delicious!  They are also quite healthy as far as potato chips are concerned.  Enjoy!
1246	4	I loved the chips they were great. They arrived on time in the mail, there were no crushed chips yay!
1247	5	Peter Pan is so delicioua you could sit down with a jar and a SPOON (if you DARE!) and enjoy it right out of the jar! Someone said Peter Pan is the Cadillac of PNB, but ROLLS ROYCE is more like it! This the PERFECT peanut butter and Amazon carries the crunchy style, too, if you like that. I personally use a spoonful as a diet saver when I feel like I just cant go on denying myself - very satisfying - works every time. The contents are basically the same as some other PNB but no HFCS or trans fat. Ingredients in order are: peanuts, sugar, and less thatn 2% of hydrogenated vegetable oil and salt.<br />Per 2 TLBS: calories 210 (150 from 17 gr fat), 6 carbs and 8 grams Protein.
1248	5	This is a great snack for my 2.5 year old son.  Easy to carry with us and he loves them.  Got them for a great price which makes them even better!
1249	5	Yeah, this gopher trap is pretty amazing!<br /><br />I have a terrible gopher infestation and I had been using the wire Macabee style traps for about two months. I had been using the Macabee traps exactly as instructed but the success rate was very low with them. If I was lucky, I might catch one or two gophers a week.<br /><br />I would spend a ridiculous amount of time every day setting up the Macabee traps just to find them buried by gophers the next day. It is incredibly frustrating because you can't just look at a Macabee trap to see if it has been sprung. You have to completely pull them up and check everything and then reset everything all over again.<br /><br />With the blackbox I've had a 100% success rate so far! I've caught a gopher every single day for the past four days and I suspect that I'll keep up this pace until I've decimated the gopher population for my entire neighborhood!<br /><br />This trap is WAY BETTER than the Macabee style traps. The Macabee traps say  easy set  on them. HA! What a joke! The black box is much easier to set and is much more powerful so it kills more humanely. I've had Macabee traps complete eviscerate gophers but somehow leave them alive to die painfully. I've had nothing but quick and clean kills with this blackbox.<br /><br />It is also much easier to  release  the dead gopher from the blackbox than with the macabee traps since the blackbox always leaves the rodent in one piece.<br /><br />Oh and my favorite part of the blackbox is that you can actually walk right up to it and look at it to see if it has been sprung, unlike the macabee traps which requires them to be pulled out to check on them.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />On Day 5 of owning this trap, I killed 4 gophers in a single day with a single trap!
1250	1	I ordered these given the reviews and given they're organic..but they have a cough medicine taste, like a cherry throat lozenge. They also have a strange consistency when you bite into them, not at all like a normal fruit snack. Luckily amazon is awesome and refunded me. Good lesson to stick to what you know!
1251	4	The reason I bought this product: different pages on the internet describe how you can make coconut milk out of coconut butter (e.g. this one here: [...]) and I have been wanting to replace my regular coffee milk with a non-dairy product (I make cafe latte at home and end up drinking LOTS of milk!)<br />NOTE: My ultimate goal is to use products that have not additives.<br /><br />I followed the instructions; heated up a spoonful of coconut butter, added just a little bit of water -- enough for a cup of milk -- and stirred it until it was blended... it tasted great in my coffee but the texture was thin and watery (I guess that's why they use guar gum in other coconut milk products) and it doesn't really froth up (I didn't really expect it to but was still hoping it would!) so overall, it's a fantastic product and I will use it for cooking, baking etc. but sadly, it didn't really work out as milk.
1252	4	These compact bars pack a nice punch of taste, texture, and healthiness.  Given their largely natural contents and reasonably low sugar amount, I feel fine grabbing these for a snack on occasion.
1253	1	I am not a happy camper. This website says  pure xylitol . What did I get? A box of packets that say  Xylitol Plus  which is Xylitol and Stevia. And, most of the time, I find Stevia to be nasty. So now I likely have to throw this whole box away and I am pissed. This seller is not worth your time. Go to your local health food store where you can hold the box you want in your hands.
1254	1	I love raw almonds but these are horrible. First bunch of almonds tasted ok but on the second handful I grabbed a bunch of dry, rancid tasting ones.  I literally spit them right out and they left a horrible taste in my mouth. Looking at these ... They don't look like raw almonds I've purchased from whole foods or trader joes.  The outer skin is dusty looking. And tastes like it looks. Would not recommend.
1255	5	We LOVE this stuff!! We have hairless cats and dogs...they are prone to skin issues...allergies, both food and enviornmental. This is a godsend for all of them!! Plus, if they lick it off their skin, it's actually good for them!
1256	5	I loved this coffee! I liked the taste a lot. It was not too strong and not too light. Their flavors were great. I don't usually like flavored coffee but they pulled it off well. Especially the maple flavored!
1257	5	This popcorn is delicious!!! It was very easy to use, and everyone we had over loved it. They shipped it a few days before we were expecting, however, I thought the shipping cost was too much.
1258	4	I am trying to find a great chai to make at home when I am not treating myself to a Starbuck's chai. I was drinking Pacific Chai (spicy) for a long time which I liked for the most part. (I made it into a vanilla chai by adding a 1/2 tsp of French Vanilla coffee-mate creamer to about a 10-oz cup of water, with 3 tbs of chai powder, while in the blender.) After a year or so, I wanted to try something different because the Pacific Chai containers were always 3/4 full - it became annoying. But it turns out that some other brands are the same.<br /> I love vanilla chai but I didn't prefer the Pacific vanilla chai because it wasn't spicy enough, and the same thing goes for Big Train Chai Vanilla - not spicy enough. I also did not like Mocafe Vanilla Chai.<br /> I would love to find the perfect vanilla chai that has great spicy flavor.
1259	1	Even though Senseo states on each package these pods can be used on all pod coffee makers, this is false. These pods are made for 70 mm diameter pod coffee makers.  My coffee maker takes 50 mm diameter pods so the Senseo pods cannot be used on my machine.  The best pods that I can use are the ones made by Starbucks.<br /><br />Amazon will not allow these to be returned because I had to open one of the packages to find out the diameter was too large to be used in my pod coffeemaker. Nowhere in the description of the Sensio pods did it mention their diameter.<br /><br />On all of the coffee pod products, Amazon should require the diameter of the pods to be specified.
1260	4	This is some pretty darn good mix... easy, too... just remember to let it rest (like they say), before using.  Lite and tasty... I'm getting hungry!  You won't be let down.  About 85% as tasty as Waffle House (Georgia) waffles, and way better than store-bought mixes.
1261	5	I discovered this product on a trip to South Africa and have found nothing else like it, even other so-called  red bush  teas sold by other companies.  This tea is entirely distinctive, subtle and delicious and has no caffeine.  Unlike many decaff teas, it is not fruity or sweet.  It has a slightly smokey flavor, a bit like Lapsang Souchong, but no bitterness at all.  It makes a great pot of tea for any time of day or night and tastes great iced.  I was so amazed to find I could buy it outside of the one South African restaurant I know of.  Hooray for Amazon!  I buy it two boxes at a time.
1262	4	I just wanted to start by responding to some of the claims made here. Firstly, you do not need to be a particular nationality or type of person to like Marmite. That's just ridiculous. Secondly, it is not a  cultural thing  to enjoy savory or  umami  foods, any more than it is cultural to like sweet, sour, bitter, or salty flavors. You either like it or you don't. Does everyone like double fudge ice cream? Incredibly, no. I find Marmite delicious, but potent. I think many times people don't enjoy it because they've eaten a gob straight from the jar or they spread it like jam. That's too much! Try it spread very thinly or add a SMALL dollop to your savory sauces and stocks. I highly recommend trying it. You may love it. If not, at least admit it's a matter of preference rather than rant like a xenophobic donkey's rump.
1263	2	This is my favorite coffee.  I had to go off caffeine, so I love that this has a nice strong coffee flavor.  I didn't notice, however, that this is not for a 2-pack.  I thought I was getting a great deal, but actually I was overpaying.  Be sure to check prices since there are several links with prime shipping at different prices.
1264	5	The tea was great!  And was the only thing that took care of All Day sickness by the third trimester.<br /><br />The only bad thing about it was the company I bought it from.  They charged $17.00 shipping for two boxes of this tea.  Next time I'll be ordering this from someone else.
1265	5	For me, half the pleasure of a good cup of coffee is the aroma while it's brewing. Since I love the scent of anything  vanilla,  I decided to try <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO >Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>. With this special blend, Starbucks promises  a subtle flavor and pleasant aroma. <br /><br />I looked forward to having it before breakfast yesterday, so was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a most delightful vanilla bouquet. That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say  Thanks,  she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch! She knows I generally add different flavors of creamer to my coffee, too, but I had wanted to test the  subtleness  promised in the ad--without any additives. Anyway, it was delicious with the creamer and I was pleased with the product.<br /><br />My true test of this natural fusions blend came this morning when I indulged myself by trying it a la naturale... Oh, my! What a taste treat!  Wow,  I thought,  this is real coffee!  The vanilla was just the right amount to blend with the other natural flavors for a perfect cup of coffee. It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!<br /><br />As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup. But then that would have been for him, not for me. And just how far should I go for a friend? Hmmmm...<br /><br />I have the open bag of coffee beside me as I type this review. I'm sitting here sniffing like a kid breathing in the aroma of a newly-baked cake. How's that for indulgence. :-)<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, December 10, 2010<br />Author of  Millennium Babe: The Prophecy,   Dream Reachers  (with Chase Von) and other books
1266	5	I've tried Frozen Explosion and love it.  It's lactose free, so I can make smoothies for my kids and not worry about allergic reactions.  And since it is a vanilla base, you can use it with coffee, chocolate, or liquer.
1267	5	I was rather stunned when I received the SF Bay Rainforest Blend Coffee.  They are in a very different little packet than I was accustomed to with the regular Kerig type cups.  I decided to give it a try.  I really  like it.  You can, just like with the other type, run as much water through it as you want and thus make it as strong as you want.  I really see no difference in that part.  In addition, I really like the  flavor .  Try it -- you'll like it, I believe.
1268	5	Kimbo was my espresso of choice when I lived in Italy.It is the most popular brand in Naples. I am so happy to be reunited with my delicious old morning friend!
1269	5	I didn't have very high expectations for these treats when I first bought them - we were just out of their other treats and I thought I'd give these a shot. Not only do our cats love them, but we've seen a huge difference in the amount of hairballs from our two furballs. We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!
1270	5	I use these as a late afternoon snack in the office. They give me just enough pep to see the workday until the end. With subscribe and save, they are less than $5 a can. We get an order of 3 cans monthly. Great stuff!
1271	3	It is an OK rice cracker, but the cheese flavor is very light. It is nice and crispy like the other Ka-Me crackers. It holds its crispyness for a few weeks in our non-humid climate. I prefer the Sesmark mini rice crackers for taste. But not everyone's taste is alike thankfully.
1272	1	I bought these squid packs because a friend shared some with me and I really enjoyed them. I couldn't find them in Austin, but was super psyched to find them on Amazon.  I really enjoyed eating the 1st squid bag.  However, by the time I got to the 3rd squid bag, I was sick of them.  Now I have 3.5 more gross squid bags that I do not want to eat.  Has this ever happened to you?  I hope not.
1273	5	these cookies are very soft and moist.. my kids love them!! my kids cant wait til i buy them again!!
1274	1	this is the worst coffee i have ever had.  all you get is literally warm water.  my secretary and i both tried it, then dumped the cups and the pot.  it tasted like warm diluted milk, sans coffee.
1275	3	this pack is really small.<br />the quantities are not much, also it contains many many berries rather the nuts and granola. it's sweet and too strong, which is salty.<br />I should've bought the nut mix!!! if i approve this small-size pack before purchasing.
1276	3	I am a single guy in his mid-20's and I buy Kitchens of India curry because it is a tremendously quick, easy dinner idea.  The taste of the curry is about on par with Chili con Carne from the can and is of relatively the same quality.  Nothing to give five stars over as for the price it is not even that good of a deal.  This item, in my opinion, is extremely over-hyped.  Don't get me wrong, not a bad food option, just not a five-star food product.
1277	1	When I received the shipment the packing box was in great condition.  I opened it to find the box tightly packed with bubble wrap and securely taped with shipping tape.  It took a box cutter to remove the protective bubble wrap.  Once removed I found the can of cherries so badly dented and damaged that it looked like it had been dropped from a third-story window and there was no way to even attempt to open it.  It had clearly been wrapped for shipping in that condition.  My only conclusion was that the product is being sold by a distributer who has a a badly damaged shipment that they need to unload because they can't sell it to their usual restaurant clients.  To Amazon's credit, when I contacted them about the problem they responded to my email within about two hours and had credited the cost of the purchase back to my credit card by the end of the same day.
1278	4	So I must admit that when I ordered this coffee, I thought it was one of the new fancy instants like Starbucks now has.  When I got it and found that it was pods, for which I do not have a maker, I almost sent it back.  But what I wanted it for was those afternoon coffee emergencies at work, where single serves would be perfect. Soooo - I used one of the pods like a tea bag, steeped it in very hot water...and ended up with a great cup of coffee!<br /><br />The flavor is very rich and fruity - not over burnt or weak like I would have expected given my McGyver-type preparation.  I enjoyed the coffee a great deal and will keep this at my desk for more than just emergencies.
1279	5	these are without a doubt the best Slim Jims out there.. they are much softer and juicier than regular-sized Slim Jims.. you wont regret buying these through Amazon..
1280	5	After reading articles concerning jerk chicken treat made in China, I checked the website for an alternative.  This product  produced in the USA provides my dog a  yummy treat and provides me with emotional relief that I am feeding my dog a safe treat.
1281	5	I found this sauce to be delicious and suitable for Mexican food or even a general purpose sauce that could kick up a sandwich, omelet, or stew with a seriously tasty Chipotle flavor.<br /><br />The hot sauce addicts who tasted it were disappointed. It has lots of flavor, but no real kick. But, these are guys that put the super hot pepper sauce on everything they eat - I'm not sure how many taste buds they really have left.
1282	5	I had been using Gosling's ginger beer for my dark and stormy's and moscow mules.  I wasn't thrilled about the high fructose corn syrup and overall super sweet taste.  Fever-Tree ginger beer is exactly what I was looking for.  Perfectly balanced, natural sweetener (cane sugar), and fantastic strong ginger taste.  Couldn't be happier.
1283	5	These are a true guilty pleasure! Much better than the name brand  Muddy Bears . The insides are soft and chewy rather than as hard as normal gummy bears are.
1284	4	My  hard to please  eater has finally decided to eat her dog food and to stop begging at the table since I started giving her the new Evo small bite dog food. Plus it is rated as one of the top commercial dog foods.
1285	5	As a chocolate lover, I found that this basket had a nice mixture of chocolatey goodness in it. Plus, it comes in a very tasteful and re-useable wire basket. Great gift idea...at a great price.  I highly recommend. :)
1286	1	a natural way to clean pups' teeth that isn't messy or smelly and that lasts a long time- my dog carries his around and will chew it for an hour at a time<br /><br />Editing review: my small dog, who had healthy teeth before I gave him antlers to chew, now has fractures on 4 molars from chewing. Give these chews with caution, if at all, tooth extraction is a painful & costly result of his enthusiasm for these chews.
1287	1	The bags in this variety pack are not 'Big Grab  bags as stated in the title. The value of this product is far less than it would have been if these were actually the much larger Big Grab bags. These small 1 oz. bags can be purchased for 20-25 cents each at various warehouse clubs. No bargain here.
1288	5	Our office received these truffles for a Christmas present. Truffles have always been one of my favorites, but there is a huge difference between brands, types, etc - even in the so-called  home made  stores. One bite of these, and I was spoiled forever! (Personally, I'm buying the two pack so I can keep one and give the other as a gift --- hopefully! LOL)<br /><br />These seem to be seasonal, so if you are at all interested, be aware of this.
1289	5	These cookies are delicious... I was looking for an alternative to the junk out there that's loaded with extra preservatives and artificial sweeteners, and this stuff pretty much fit the bill.<br /><br />You can actually guess at what you're eating by looking at the box.  Very simple to understand, and the ingredients list isn't a mile long!  As an added plus, the preparation is VERY simple -- just an egg and a stick of butter, and you're off and running!<br /><br />Give them a try, and maybe you'll have a new favorite ;)
1290	5	Your dog will love these.  They are crunchy rather than pliable, and easy to break off into small pieces.  With all of the problems related to chicken treats made in China, it's worth spending a few bucks more to get a product made in the USA.
1291	4	I actually really loved these. I was looking for some dried raspberries that tasted like some that were mixed in with a Trader Joe's trail mix. I could not find the same raspberries anywhere but here. These were exactly what I was looking for! They don't taste like the freeze-dried raspberries, but are more moist. They are really easy to eat and taste amazing. The only reason why I gave this review a 4 is because of the price. I think the price is a bit steep, but my guess is because it might be difficult to dry raspberries. If the price were lower, I would literally have them on a repeat order basis. However, if you are looking to try these, definitely do so! I think you will be happy with your purchase.
1292	5	My son can consume the whole box in two days! Great price for a quick snack...maybe it's not the healthy food I would like to see him eat, but it makes him happy! And I don't really let him eat the whole box in 2 days!
1293	1	FYI: The  Natural flavors  claimed on the container appear to be  dust  and  all-purpose flour,  and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never  mix  with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk.
1294	4	After watching Goji berries recommended on Oprah, I searched around for a good deal that was organic.  They are interesting in texture and taste. Dried and a little sticky inside when you chew them.  I put a handful of them on morning cereal or oatmeal and for afternoon snack.
1295	5	This candy flavoring is top shelf. A little goes a loooong way. My husband even said he could smell the mint aroma in the next room. LOL Compared to other stores, the price is great. If you're looking for highly concentrated flavoring, I recommend.
1296	1	Seriously?!!!! Have you read the product features? It Says  Place in large critter keeper for frogs to burrow.  What the hell???!! Does anybody preview/edit this stuff? I volunteer.
1297	5	We have only been using this fencer for two weeks now but are very happy with it.  Was fairly easly to install and is working great!!
1298	1	I'm a real fan of iced coffee and was looking forward to this K-cup flavor. What a disappointment! No matter how it was prepared and no matter what was added to it, it simply tasted awful. Letting another flavor cool and then add ice would make a far better cup of iced coffee.
1299	5	When I received this product, there was a small dent in the bottle.  I wouldn't care, but I was giving it as a gift, so I called to see if I could exchange it.  They were VERY helpful, and in fact sent me another bottle very quickly!! :)  Great service!!!
1300	5	I ordered this to try primarily becuase I come from a part of the East Coast where our Tap water or Well water is naturally more Alkaline  than it is here in SOuthern CA.  For almost 20 years I've tried to make a decent crispy pizza crust or the right combination of tender on the inside, crsuty on the outside homemade breads.  I tried addiing things that should make the PH of my doughs more alkaline, hoping to reproduce the baking of my upbringing and yet.. I always failed.  Shortly before she died, an italian neighbor of mine from back east suggested I carry back some bottled water from our own well and save it just for bread baking.  well, after 9/11, you couldn't do that and it seemed all the bottled waters out here in CA tasted like sulfur and made my bread crusts tough.  The Good news is that I tried making several different types of bread using the Essentia and it DID seem to do the trick.  That may be a silly reason to buy bottled water but if you want to bake your great-grandmother's bread for the holidays, then what'sa few bottles of special water gonna hurt?<br /><br />As for taste?  It tasted fine to me - no better or worse than the best waters I've had. I can't say speak to the issue of GERD and acid reflux but if this water helps somebody with that, it's a lot better than getting hooked on Proton-pump inhibitor prescriptions that cause even more problems than they solve.  I read many of the reviews from people who were buying the Essentia for that reason and many of them seem to have found this water gives them more natural relief.  It's an interesting approach and one worth trying since the environmental impact and carbon footprint of relying for life on Prevacid or Nexium is far worse than simply swithing the bottled water you drink.  In a perfect world, we'd all toss our bottled water and use Tap filters but Essentia's Reverse Osmosis process followed by Ionic Separartion tech is a little bit.. no.. way above the cost reach of most home-owners.<br /><br />Me, I'll use my tap filter for drinking water but when I bake anything, I'll likely use Essentia as the water called for in the recipe because it most closely mimics the effect that the natural well water of my youth had on the baking process.  Water is not simply H20 - the minerals in it contribute to the outcome in cooking as does the pH.  Sure, I could just dump some extra baking soda in but that never worked in the past as well as Essentia has worked in my recent baking spree.  I'm a believer in it's chemcial differences vis a vis baking.  If helps some people reduce acid stomach without medication then they've found a unique way to help others.  You know how much a year's worth of Nexium costs?  Do the math and then you'll see my point.<br /><br />I don't think essentia will rock the world of bottled water but like Coconut water, caffiene water and even mint water, if it ain't HFCS soda, it's not as bad.  Sure, we should drink tap water but some people can't.  Until we all have Triple filtering technologies, there's Essentia.
1301	5	When we first moved from California to Florida I was unable to locate yuban coffee in the large can size. I looked it up on the internet and found a good price and free shipping. Ever since that time I order over the internet with no problems. Fast free shipping and a happy husband who wakes to his pot of Yuban every morning.<br /><br />I wouod highly recommned this product, price and ammazon.
1302	5	These used to almost never be in stock.  Inventory has improved, making them more predictable.  It is a delicious flavored coffee, not too much flavor since I normally drink my coffee black.  Quite good, give it a shot!
1303	4	For starters, the taste is sweeter than table sugar and I'll take a stab and say it's something like a caramel candy taste. I've tried other manufacturers brands and they are similar to this one in taste, but can't beat the price however. Larrrge bottles, but easy to use squeeze bottle (plastic is just thin enough to squeeze easy). Doesn't fit any of my shelves, but tends to get used often so I'm ok with it just sitting on my counter. I love it in coffee/tea/on pancakes/in oatmeal and in cornbread (very nice btw). I won't give this 5 stars just due to the fact that I got 2 bottles, but only 1 cap. I know...I sound a little cheap here, but maybe it's a one time thing too. Anyway, I ordered this so I could use one for home, and one for work so I had to make a top for one. I have another order that should arrive next month so we'll see if it was an oversight.<br /><br />For the homebrewers out there...I used half of one bottle to make a honey/agave wine (about same amount buckwheat honey)...technically a mead, but it's about half of each so call it what you will...might be the harshest thing I've ever made but why not experiment, right?
1304	5	If you're ever in the mood to just munch on something and not have it kill you in calories, this is it.<br />It has crunch and a little salt. Looking at other reviews, it IS a lot like eating air, but again,<br />for those of us who can't afford to eat a bag of chips, this is the best substitute. You're not going to<br />eat one and be like - WOW. This is the best snack I've ever had. BUT, it's the  best when you're looking to find something crunchy that you can eat while watching a movie. It works for me so well, that when my local BJ's stopped carrying them (which is a sign I know), I had to go directly to the vendor to find where I can get them. Now I have to buy at Trader Joe's and they're much more money now. Still - they work for me like nothing else.<br />I must add I only like the Sea Salt. I've only tried one other flavor and didn't like it. If anyone finds out where I can buy the huge economy sized bag that BJ's used to sell, PLEASE tell me! It's a great deal! I wish they didn't stop selling it...
1305	1	If you like the (bitter) taste of Sweet & Low, get this. If you don't, don't. Couldn't get through one cup of coffee (and I only used 1/2 of the tiny packet).<br /><br />I'm gonna give  Stevia Extract in the Raw  a try. It's made by the folks at  Sugar in the Raw.  (And, no, I don't work for their company.) Here's what they claim:<br /><br /> Stevia Extract In The Raw gets its delicious, natural sweetness from Rebiana (aka Reb-A) -- an extract from the Stevia plant. This extract is the sweetest part of the plant and has recently been isolated to provide pure sweetening power without the licorice-like aftertaste that many of our predecessors exhibited. All you get is the sweet flavor without any calories. <br /><br />We'll see. Simply-Stevia is simply nasty.
1306	2	Green Mountain has a reputation for making great coffee and I routinely have my favorites shipped to me.  But this blend is way too weak for me.<br /><br />My favorite coffee is <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K >Barista Prima Coffeehouse, Italian Roast, 24- Count K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers</a> and when I want something slightly weaker I drink <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA >Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Box (Pack of 2)</a>.  For the extended family, however, I keep medium, mild, decaf, and flavored coffees available.  The house favorite for medium is <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TC7WN4 >Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed (Medium Roast),  24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>.<br /><br />I brewed this k-cup strong and tried it first without cream.  It had a definite coffee aroma but the taste was weak and unusual (not bad but grain?).  I then added 1/2 my usual cream and that actually made it worse.  I suppose if I drank it together with some sweet pastry it would taste fine but, by itself, it's just not appealing to me.<br /><br />I suggest, if you need extra vitamin C and E, you buy a better tasting coffee and drink it with a good multivitamin.
1307	5	I'm not a huge coffee drinker but my husband is and we both like this coffee.....that's a lot to say since I don't like strong coffee but my husband does.  This coffee is rich in taste without being bitter or strong and yet taste great to my husband.
1308	5	We love this tea... not bitter... very smooth.  And organic too!  BONUS!!!!!  :o)
1309	5	Changed eating habits to shed weight a while back.  Have always liked  long grain & wild rice , but was looking for something better than offered at our grocery store.  After reading the reviews of this rice, ordered two of the 6-packs to qualify for free shipping.  It is really excellent.  My wife and I enjoy it very much.  I prepare it in a rice cooker. I've found that for a slightly crunchy texture, the water to rice ratio should be around 2.5:1 (2.5 parts water to 1 part rice).  For something softer, a little more water.  Highly recommend this product.  You won't be disappointed.  Amazon price much less than the grocery store.
1310	5	I just discovered a new flavor of Larabar:  Carrot Cake.  I love carrot cake, and this bar is awesome.  It tastes just like carrot cake.  The yummy, scrumptious ingredients of dates, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, unsweetened coconut, carrots, cinnamon, and extra virgin olive oil all put together is heavenly.  This is one of my favorite flavors of Larabars.<br /><br />I can't sing enough praises for Larabars:  good taste, healthy, convenient.  It's good to have a few (or a lot) on hand in case you get a little hungry or weak.<br /><br />And, oh, I must mention:  These bars are created and made in Colorado.  I know, that has nothing to do with the goodness of these bars.  But Colorado is my new favorite state, so I mentioned it.  The goodness of these bars are just as wonderful as Colorado is beautiful.  And if you know how breathtaking Colorado is, then you know I am comparing these bars to something awesome.  Awesome, healthy, tasty bars that are convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.<br /><br />Carrot cake highly recommended if you like carrot cake.
1311	5	I ordered these for my protein shakes to add omega-3 and fiber. I'd never used flaxseed meal before, so I was worried, but the reviews here were go good, I risked the 4-pack with the S&S savings offer.<br /><br />Lovely. Been using it 2 to 3 times a day for my between meal whey/almond milk/flax shakes. The flax has a mild flavor that makes my smoothies lightly reminniscent of malted and wheat shakes my dad made me as a kid.<br /><br />I avoid gluten/malt nowadays, so this is a nice addition to my supplementary nutrients.<br /><br />I need to see how else to work it into my diet, as I cannot eat seafood or take krill or fish oils (allergic), and this is an easy way to add the good omega to my intake.<br /><br />Thanks to all who reviewed it previously. Made it easier for me to take the plunge. :D
1312	3	I bought these thinking it would be nice for a change. My take on them is EHHHH not that great of a taste. The sugar coating tasts more synthetic than like blueberries.
1313	4	Unless you live next door to a Whole Foods, it's pretty difficult to find coconut water, much less organic coconut water. To this end I would highly recommend getting it from Amazon since having Prime, it has really saved me a bundle. As far as the actual product goes, I much prefer the taste of CoCo Libre to other brands. I've even heard that it contains more potassium than regular coconut waters.
1314	5	I like a fairly bold cup-o-joe and am completely satisfied with this blend in our machine.  I even brew it for the largest cup (12oz) and it tastes wonderful.  Other blends were too weak for me, but this one hits the spot!
1315	5	I have 2 dogs and while I don't give a lot of treats, I like to have a variety of items on hand to put in the everlasting ball, Kong etc., to keep them interested on days when the weather is not conducive to getting out.  My thought with these sticks was that if I cut a little off one end, it would be a perfect fit for the everlasting ball.  It turns out, they are hard as a rock!  I tried a couple of different knives and even my meat cleaver, but none of them made any headway in cutting off the 2  I needed to remove.  Then I picked it up and tried to break it with my hands, and it snapped in two right on the line I had been trying to cut (perhaps I scored it a little).  Anyway, it turns out that is the secret to these things - breaking instead of cutting.<br /><br />I am not in the least concerned about the caloric value of them so that was not figured into my perception of the treats in any way.  One of my dogs is slender - the other downright skinny (has a high metabolism and is offered plenty to eat but never finishes a meal).  The older, slender dog got the 2  bit I cut off and the younger skinny dog got the remainder of the stick in her everlasting ball.  May not be fair but she had to work harder to get it so it all comes out in the wash.<br /><br />The older dog practically took my hand off to get to the treat quickly.  Once she had it, she ran off and put it back on the floor so she could take her time with it.  I will say that the little 2  stick lasted her much longer than I would have expected so I rate them high for that reason.  The chewing action is good for their teeth/jaws and is far preferable to a treat they gobble down without tasting.<br /><br />The younger dog went racing after her everlasting ball and stayed busy for a long time trying to get it out.  I wasn't around when she finally succeeded to know how long it took her to eat it but am glad it kept her interested for awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is cute and the bag is resealable.  I believe they are kind of pricey and for that reason I might not order them again.  Otherwise I am completely satisfied.
1316	5	Our family now uses this in place of butter or other oils for all our cooking needs. It tastes sooo good - it has a very nice lite sweet taste to it. Also it is much healthier for you than butter or other oils. We use All Clad cookware and have no trouble with sticking as long as adequate coconut oil is used when cooking.
1317	5	Incredible flavors, very pleased with the variety.  Taste great, popped not fried.  Low fat, excellent go to food when you crave salty and don't want mega fat and calories.
1318	5	The benefits of coconut oil are amazing. This is a high quality product and a great value!<br />I would recommend this item.
1319	3	I Initially liked it but when left alone with my dog, her chewed thru the rope and plunger rendereing it useless. Lasted less then a week with my destroyer of a dog.
1320	5	Have purchased this many times over and totally love it! Can't wait to try the other new flavors that Emeril has to offer! Very happy!<br /><br />Automatic delivery is the best! Great price, awesome ship time; thank you Amazon!!!
1321	5	This stuff is not only healthy,but taste yummy too. my son loved it. It also arrived quickly and well packaged.
1322	5	Great texture and balance of sweet to butter is just about right. Adults and kids both love them. Recommended
1323	5	Taste is individual so you either like it or you don't. This mochi is sweet but not too sweet, I like it. I enrolled to Amazon's automatic delivery on this product, so that says a lot. Shipping is free & quick and the product is always fresh, kudos to Amazon. I'm yours for life.
1324	4	This product smells absolutely wonderful. I thought maybe they added fragrance, even though it was supposed to be organic...NOPE! All natural! Very moisturizing! I will be using it mainly for my natural (African-American) hair, and skin. I've only used a little, but can't wait to try it out for it's many uses. My only complaint was the packaging. The box was 6x bigger than the product. I just think it was a waste to have packaged it in such a big box. If they'd used a better choice of packaging, I would have rated it a five. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase : )
1325	5	I give the blu-ray version of Beetlejuice five stars for the picture and sound quality alone.  The improvements compared to the previous DVD release are HUGE.  If I had to choose between warner spending money and time on a better transfer or more extra content, I would choose the better transfer.  After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.  My favorite aspect of this release is seeing the detail on the stop-motion puppets, the surreal set design, and Oscar winning makeup.  I can't recommend this enough.
1326	5	The packaging and process of making these awesome chips caught my attention.  I also read the one review and decided to order these on the monthly shipment to save money because they're a little expensive.  The banana chips are absolutely delicious.  I have never had anything quite like them.  They're crispy, packed with flavor, and healthy!  I can't wait to try the rest of Danielle's line.  My family loves them, too.
1327	5	I had trouble finding Snackwells in the 12 in a case package.  I was VERY thankful to be able to get them through Amazon.com.  We love these, as they are delicious, and it is a great way to limit the amount per serving.
1328	4	The pretzels aren't bad for those of us that have to maintain a gluten free diet.  They are tastier than the pretzels with sesame seeds.
1329	5	Bought this for a birthday party to make cotton candy and before I knew it all the cotton candy was gone. I kept getting asked to make more from both kids and adults. It tastes just like the cotton candy from a carnival or circus. It tastes and smells delicious.
1330	5	Product was priced fairly; delivery was fast and affordable.  If you have ever had Heinz India Relish, this is exactly like it, which is different than most other pickle relishes--I think it is made with sweet pickles and bread-and-butter pickles.  Mix this relish with fresh or canned corn and a little onion and bell pepper, and you have the perfect Corn Relish for a summer side-dish.  Delicious.
1331	5	When I found out I was pregnant with my first child, I read in a baby magazine about the wonderful health benefits of Chia seeds. They are packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, and because healthy brain function is nurtured by Omega-3 fatty acids, I wanted to supplement my diet with something other than fish oil pills that can pack a fairly unpleasant aftertaste.<br />These seeds are so tiny, and so flavorless, that you can mix them into cereal, or even juice, without ever realizing you have consumed them. I have also found that adding these seeds to my breakfast keeps me fuller longer.<br />Chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds, and a pound of them, costing around $12 (depending on the seller), lasts a few months.<br />If you want to avoid the potential unpleasantness of fish oil supplements, Chia seeds are a great alternative, and for new or expecting mothers, they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s/he needs for optimum brain health and development.<br />Lastly, you do not have to be considering motherhood to consider adding Chia to your diet. It is a wonderful, all-natural supplement that is perfectly painless (in both taste and cost) to undertake.<br /> Who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the (infamous)  Chia Pet  would offer so much more than a gawdy table ornament?<br />Highly recommended.
1332	5	My kids and I love this flavor of rice-a-roni! The broccoli au gratin is our other favorite.
1333	5	Pop Chips are delicious, light and tasty. I bought a box of the Parmesan Garlic and it almost dissapeared before I had a chance to eat some of them.
1334	1	I have been drinking tea for at least 30 years. I never use tea bags and always make tea using traditional method. I know all different kinds of tea like barooti, etc better than everyone else. I received the package in time but the quality is really bad. I am 100% sure than this is not barooti. Do not buy this kind of tea if you really want good quality. I had to blend it with other kinds but it did not help at all. You can easily see that it is rubbish.
1335	5	So easy to use. No measuring just open the bag and dump everything in.  The combination of all the ingredients makes this popcorn so delicious.
1336	2	I bought the 16-pack in May 2011 and the date on the label says  best by  May 2012.  Baby & I spent some time away from home this summer and when we returned in August, I opened one of these packs and the smell was of over-ripe spoiled mangos (with that wine smell).  They were fine when I purchased in May and baby loved it, but now I have 10+ packs that I need to throw away and Amazon won't let me return these.  Seems unfair when the label clearly states they are ok until next year.
1337	5	Every single week I buy a new box of water flavoring for my family. We have a hard time finding ones that don't have artificial flavoring and colorings, and usually when we DO find one they taste awful. But this new Lipton product has made my whole family so happy! It tastes AMAZING without any nasty after taste, it's low in calories, but I feel great knowing that it's got all-natural sweeteners and colors in it. I will never buy a different kind of water flavoring again!
1338	3	I would say this rates around standard for your non-dairy mac n cheese. It's alright, edible, and filling but not amazing and something you would be craving to have again. I like that it's organic and whole wheat at a decent price. Not sure I would buy it again as I expected something a little more cheesy like. I rather get some noodles and pasta sauce over this.
1339	5	This is by far the best brewed tea I have made. I enjoy good quality tasting tea and this takes the cake. It is really nice to be able to have a glass of tea in minutes without all the messy bags. I will be keeping this in stock at my house for sure.
1340	1	The tug-a-war toy and the frisbee disk look like they are nice online, when they arrive they are terribly made. The tennis balls fall apart almost immediately and have a strong toxic smell to them. My dog is only a medium size dog and he had the rubber pulled off of the frisbee disk in a matter of seconds christmas day. We could not give him either toy back in fear of him choking on the pieces that were coming off. The game has held up so far. it is made of plastic and we always supervise him playing with him. We will see how that goes. If you don't mind paying the amount for just the game and throwing away the other two toys than it's not a big deal. I was just disappointed in the quality. There are better brand name games out there for your dog.
1341	5	Whole Wheat Bunnies are so tasty and we eat them non-stop.  Buying one box at a time at our local grocery store just wasn't enough. We eat multiple boxes a week and our store was often out of stock.  Now we buy them a case at a time online
1342	5	I discovered these KIND bars at the airport. They are pretty good for you and taste great !  Just what I have been searching for!  If only Pizza was good for you, I would be all set !
1343	5	This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works.
1344	5	This is a great flavored iced tea, easy to make since it is cold brewed. We make it by the pitcher and keep it in the refrigerator. It is now hard to find in stores, but Amazon has it at a reasonable price.
1345	5	Amazon was very timely in getting the product to us despite the weather.  My dogs loved the food
1346	5	This is a good Strong Tea. The Flavor is a nice blend not to strong and not weak. Smells great when brewing. You can add milk or drink it plain.
1347	1	I ordered this item because the picture shows that it is a Blue Sky Sugar Free Soda. The product is actually Hansen's Cherry Vanilla Cream Soda sweetened with cane sugar. I was looking for a sugar free soda because I am a Diabetic. I was very disappointed!
1348	1	I do buy several Walden Farms products. However this tastes like sweet glue. It never laid next to a peanut. Come on Walden Farms make some serious changes to this product. Many of us can't afford to throw food out!
1349	5	These are great for diets.  Only 2 Weight Watchers points per entire (not huge, but not tiny) brownie.  They are moist, chewy, and yummy.  Low (100) calorie and high fiber, plus 75% organic.  Definitely a great find.
1350	5	I was testing buying this cheese online and it was great.  I will get it again.  The cheese came in tasting great and I liked it on my ground beef.  Really enjoyed it and would recommend it.
1351	4	I actually like this cookie very much. The reason I am not giving it a  five star is because when I took my first bite I thought that it tasted OK. I thought oh, it's vegan that's why it tastes OK. So, maybe it grew on me. But now, I just love them. They are soft and moist. They have just enough walnuts in them to give it a great flavor.
1352	3	Wanted to sample the K-cups. Previously a  tea bag  user for the same product.  Will stick with the tea bags, as the tea is not only more fragrant, but extremely flavorful. Will not purchase K-cups again.
1353	5	This curry powder has a nice well-blended flavor.  And, it is hot without being too hot. It adds a nice variety to many of my dishes, espeically fried rice which I eat quite often.
1354	5	It is the 11th of May, 2011. My doctor has just informed me that my Jimmies are terminally rustled.<br /><br />I had no idea how to react. Would any reaction I had be legitimate? Or would it be tainted by the state of my Jimmies?<br /><br />I've been living with RJS (Rustled Jimmy Syndrome) for almost a year now. I've tried more  cures  than would intimidate even a cancer patient. At first I tried wearing a three-wolf shirt. It helped with my self-esteem, but it didn't do anything about my Jimmies. I even tried buying a $2,000 HDMI cable, hoping the multidimensional X-Rays that would be exuding from my television would be enough to unrustle my Jimmies on a molecular level. That was $2,000 wasted.<br /><br />I had no hope. That is, until I found Gorilla Munch. The primary ingredient in Gorilla Munch, Love(tm), provided high enough levels of necessary nutrients to unrustle even my Jimmies! After consulting my doctor, I've received the news that the rustling in my Jimmies is in regression, and I should expect to have completely unrustled Jimmies by August 2012.<br /><br />I cannot thank this cereal enough for what it's done for me.
1355	5	I love these TVP chunks as a veggie substitute in recipes that call for chicken. It is great in  chicken  curries, casserole, and creamy soups and stews. Although TVP is normally really boring, these chunks have a great texture and seems to have a really good taste in sauce-rich recipes. They are slightly more chewy than minced TVP, which makes your recipe more interesting. My meat-eating friends don't seem to spot that this is veggie food, so I suppose that is a plus for entertaining ... :-)<br />These chunks reconstitute really quickly (about 10 minutes) in water or cooking sauce. So this is a very easy ingredient to use. The chunks provide good value and a tasty addition for veggie cooking.
1356	5	We have a picky Abyssinian who had urinary crystals and needed either prescription food from the vet or canned food with a lot of extra moisture to keep the crystals from forming. A combination of this food and another 80%+ moisture high quality canned cat food has done this trick.<br /><br />  The salmon flavor of this type is his favorite. When he might normally walk away after eating less than half a small can of other foods, he will eat nearly an entire 3oz. can by himself given about 10 minutes. (He doesn't inhale his food like our two other Abys do. They will down this flavor in about 2 minutes flat.) All three Abys love the salmon in salmon consomme'. It is flaked salmon in plenty of moisture, a clear liquid  consomme'  with gravy-like consistency.<br /><br />  This is grain free and does not contain any poultry products (an allergy issue with our picky eater). We are very pleased with this AvoDerm product. We did not purchase it here online, as they were  out of stock  when I found it listed on Amazon.com. However, if it becomes available, I plan to purchase multiple cases.
1357	5	This is my favorite hot cocoa drink. I really enjoy putting a scoop of it in my coffee; what a nice treat!<br />I hope you'll look into the story behind Equal Exchange - That makes this sweet treat even sweeter. what a nice way to get a warm feeling -TWICE!<br />(The only downside, and it's no biggy, the outside packaging looks nothing like the picture in the information. Not sure why. That did cause me some alarm at first till I tasted the product and it seems just like what I was hoping for.)<br />ENJOY IT!
1358	4	This chip has a little tomato taste but the jalepeno seems mild. Good alternative to plain tortilla chips. Not overwhelmed by the taste but a good change.
1359	5	He is now 14 months old and can't get enough of this yogurt. He even throws a tantrum when the cup is empty. He never refuses any food (except occasionally green vegetables) but you would think it was chocolate ice cream by his attitude towards it.
1360	1	I brewed this tea as directed.  It has no blueberry flavor at all.  Though the flavor is nice, it is not appealing to me.  Guess I was expecting to have a blueberry taste...I wonder why!  Oh, yes, it is a blueberry flavored tea!  If you are looking for blueberry, pass by this product and try another brand.  Though I love Stash teas, especially the mint ones, this one is disappointing.
1361	5	DON'T THINK TWICE!  YUMMY YUMMY!  Teas, ice cream, low cal pudding I make-  YUM!
1362	4	The following recommendation is based on having enjoyed over 100 tea varieties in the last 2+ years.<br /><br />This tea has a pleasant flavor when prepared as recommended.<br /><br />Nice!
1363	5	I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.<br /><br />I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!!
1364	4	I have enjoyed this product and it has been a big hit whenever I take it to a party.  The only problem I have had is that sometimes when you peel the foil off, the chocolate bottle will break and all the good stuff runs all over the place.  My suggestion is that when you open one do it over a sink or something like that because it can be very messy.
1365	5	My baby loves these and I have actually gotten my 3yo and 5 1/2 yo to eat these as well. They are so nice I just open and give them the pouch and they  drink  it.
1366	4	I too think these strips are a bit too sweet - but this one has 10 grams of protein. Now the that prices have gone up, it's close to what I would pay in the one store in my town that sells them. It also took weeks to get them with the free shipping.  So hmm...
1367	4	No funny after taste for me! Rich and SO MUCH BETTER than the green mountain coffee which is watery and artificial tasting.  Not as good of course as a cafe hot cocoa but best one I've found for the keurig.
1368	4	I agree this bread could be a little better.  It is dry and it has to be toasted.  I hope that it is currently unavailable because they are making it better, but I hope not by adding something I can't eat.  Meanwhile I am breadless.  This is the only bread I've been able to find that has no milk, no gluten and no rice.
1369	5	I'm sure the slow mixing was simply because we were mixing them in ice water, and everything dissolves slower in ice water. However, the flavor was very good, the product was convenient, and we will buy it for sure.  Excellent for camping.
1370	5	I use this to make frappes at home by blending 2 tablespoons of it with non fat milk, ice and a packet of Starbucks French Roast Via.  Tastes just as good or better than your local coffee store and is less than half the cost.  This product is great!
1371	1	I received this item about a week ago. I should say I am disappointed.<br /><br />Like other reviewers had pointed out, the plant was much smaller than advertised on Amazon site. The one I received is very small (about 6 inch), 2 tiny branches and skinny (main truck is less than 2mm), nothing close to the picture they put online.<br /><br />I actually read the complaint reviews before made the order, thought they might just had a bad luck. Oh well, who am I to think that  may the odds just be in my favor ...?<br /><br />I paid $13.98 (incl $6.99 S&H). Not worth the money at all in my opinion
1372	5	...if you don't own an AeroGrow get one.  The Chili Peppers are  exciting  to watch grow!  And a great product to spice things up with!!
1373	2	My dog loves tug-a-war with ropes and etc so I thought this would be a great toy for her, since she is left alone during the day while I'm at work.  The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the  scent holes  and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately.
1374	4	We like this coffee better than any whole beans sold by regular grocery stores.  This blend is a lighter roast, which we prefer over the darker roasts. And it is very convenient having it delivered to our house.  You have saved us many trips to gourmet coffee stores.
1375	4	This is a great value you what you will find elsewhere.  Yes the packaging is terrible but it is a box within another box.  The inside box is poor and there will be sugar spilling into the outer box but not in large amounts.  After just taking the inner box out, leaving the spilled sugar crystals in the outer box it was still over 5 lbs so who cares how its packaged.  With that said if you are hoping this sugar will have a different or deeper flavor than normal sugar it won't.  There is more 'raw' sugar or even sugar with more molasses but this is just colored sugar.  The description is not misleading but it may not be a direct comparison to some of the alternatives.  The crystal size was pretty large any larger it would take forever to dissolve in your drink (if you care about that).
1376	5	I was using Royal Canin puppy food at first but then decided to give Wellness a try (for my husband's doberman puppy).  He loves it and its really put weight on him.  He is 7 months old and a little over 95lbs.  His skin no longer looks dry or flaky (as if he had dandruff)... his coat is very shiny and smooth. He has a sensitive stomach but does well on this food.
1377	4	I use this product primarily for oatmeal/maple scones I make regularly. The recipe calls for a small amount of maple extract. Recently, I decided to experiment by switching Agave syrup with maple syrup in the recipe. I added an extra teaspoon of the maple extract to the agave syrup and in the final scones, I couldn't taste the difference.
1378	5	I was very surprised to find the beans so entirely clean--no foreign matter, no dust etc.  Also very happy to have found the exact bean that our Swedish relatives brought over.  Some other beans that are advertised as such, simply were not the same ones.  The price here was much better than others I've seen.
1379	5	I live in an area where the tap water does not taste so great. Bottled water is a treat for me and I have tried a few different brands. Essentia is one of the best I have tried.<br /><br />I usually drink bottled water that is listed as  spring water.  This is the first time I have tried purified water with added electrolytes. I don't taste mineral or other flavors, I only taste great tasting water. This water tastes sweet and fresh. By sweet I don't mean sweet in a sugary sense but sweet in fresh and pure sense.<br /><br />I don't care about how a water is made and will not buy water because of things added to it like electrolytes. I care about taste.  This tastes great.
1380	2	I love this tea but I was shorted 1 bag, and I counted twice. I bought 100 and not 99.
1381	4	This beverage is pretty easy to prepare - just add hot water to the powder and stir.  The drink smelled wonderful - a nice spicy ginger with a lingering bit of lemon and just a touch of sweetness.  I expected it to taste similar, and was a little disappointed that there seemed to be less lemon flavor than the smell suggested.  After a several sips, I decided it was a little spicy for me to enjoy as it was, so I decided to add a couple of lumps of sugar.  Sweetening it up a bit made the drink a success for me and I really enjoyed the remainder.<br /><br />The major downside to this for me is the price.  At a little under $4 a box, I will probably opt to stick with a much less expensive ginger tea and add my own lemon.  While this drink has no steeping time, I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes to save some money.
1382	3	I like many Newman's Own products and love the concept--that all the profits go to such worthy causes including a camp for children with cancer.<br /><br />And ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, so I was happy when this product showed up on Vine. It's nice to be able to give a positive review to a product whose sale benefits so many people. Organic flour and organic sugar were examples of quality ingredients in use.<br /><br />So, imagine my disappointment when the bag arrived. Its a cute bag of cookies, and about 30 cookies with a removable tape to help seal it so they stay crisp. The first one I tried had a good snap and a strong ginger flavor--which I really liked and think ginger cookies should have. It also had the right balance of sweetness--some, but not too much.<br /><br />The second cookie was so different. One, crisp and fresh tasting; the other chewy (not in a good way) and a bit flat tasting. I thought maybe it was just a weird  odd  one in the batch, but...no. About half the cookies are one way, half the other. And they even look different--lt brown v. dark brown, curved like a vanilla wafer v. flat as the proverbial pancake. They seemed a bit over-baked and the after taste was not burned, exactly, but not pleasant.<br /><br />I thought maybe this was packaged just for Vine, but...no, it seems to be just the regular product. They're not inedible, they are made with organic flour and sugar, and they do go to a good cause. Just be prepared for the inconsistency and maybe use the kind you -don't- like to eat for baking or cooking. I ground up the flat ones to use with a pie (they'd be good on ice cream, too).
1383	5	the sun-maid apples i received from amazon.com are delicious and i plan on buying alot more in the near future. i am very happy with them.
1384	5	We first tasted this at a friend's place; a friend abroad had gifted it to them and they were generous enough to share a couple of jars with us. We just couldn't get over the taste. Sure enough, we found it online on Amazon.com. My husband and I both love hot, spicy food and this was so flavor enhancing! Pairs great with wontons (dumplings), bland soups, any type of grilled meat and veggies. Just use your imagination! You've got to try some TODAY!
1385	5	This seasoning is amazing - I wasn't a fan of roast until I used this seasoning. Very prompt shipping by seller.
1386	5	I dont mind paying a little extra because my dog loves these and I like that it only has two ingredients. Its well worth the investment...
1387	2	I wanted the Kona taste and didn't get it with this coffee. It tasted bitter and old. I would not recommend buying it at any price. In the future I will fill my ecopod holders with store bought kona ground at expresso grind.
1388	5	If you haven't tried it, you are really missing out. It works great on so many things. You can add it to vegetables in lieu of butter or oil - broccoli with a little lemon juice and this stuff has a great taste. Warm up some pita bread and brush a littlgarlic gold on it - wow!<br />I use it on a lot of things and we enjoy it. You can also use as a dipping sauce for some good Italian bread. I could go on and on.
1389	5	We have an 18 year old cat and he had actually lost weight and didn't look too good.  At the time we were feeding him his usual excellent quality dry kibble.  However, when I added this canned food to his diet ( he gets a small amount 3 times a day along with his dry food) his health changed dramatically.  He added some weight and he looks so much better.  Holistic Select pet foods are top quality.
1390	5	My kitty Petunia, received a bag of these treats for Christmas from a friend. She runs when she hears me take the bag out of the kitchen drawer. She is pretty finicky, but absolutely loves these treats. So we ordered lots from Amazon. Yum!
1391	5	This is a great espresso machine.  It is so nice to drink a smooth cup of espresso with the perfect crema on top.  It took some getting used to drinking espresso that was not bitter.  I have been using a stovetop espresso maker for 13-14 years.  The difference between correctly made espresso is like night and day.  My taste buds were accustomed to drinking bitter espresso at home.  Now, I am spoiled with this smooth and perfectly-made espresso.  So good, I even drink it without my usual spot of cream and sugar.  Another bonus, is the panarello steam wand.  My kids really enjoy it when I steam a cup of milk for them and then add hot chocolate mix to it.  THey get a kick out of how good the hot chocolate is.  I highly recommend this product.  You could pay more to get a machine built with an exterior of stainless steel, but why bother?  This machine's exterior of plastic is fairly sleek, high-tech looking, and handsome.  It looks good on the counter top.  Before you make yourself an espresso, remember to pour some steaming water into your espresso cup to warm it up.  I find that my espresso cups are on the cool side and tend to make my espressos turn cold rather quickly.  Go ahead and  splurge, this makes a great gift!
1392	1	I use Truvia, the best tasting sweetener I've ever tried.<br />Reading the reviews (suspicious), I decided to try SweetLeaf.<br />What a disappointment! The after taste is worse than Equal or Sweet&Low.<br />Bad, bad, bad!<br /><br />Thanks to the great customer service from amazon.com, I was able to get a refund.
1393	5	Barhyte has now discontinued the branding arrangement, but the  Mama Mia  brand has replaced it.  Absolutely the BEST cocktail onions for gibsons!
1394	5	This vegetable broth is flavorful and so easy to use! I frequently use this instead of chicken broth, as the flavor is superior to many chicken broths and wins over bouillon hands down. I like to take it camping because of the size.  It's also great for those small amounts of broth that doesn't require an entire can--it doesn't take up a lot of cabinet space, either. Use an entire packet with less water for a more condensed broth.
1395	5	I purchased this product because it was on a health food program and they featured it due to its high quality and good for your body.  I have always liked oatmeal but it took time to prepare as I did not like the instant.  I read the 'contents' of almost 100% of the food I buy as I have serious health issues.  This particular product is pure and simple GROUND OATS.  It is easy to prepare in a microwave (takes 4 min) or if you want to make a larger amounts (there is only me in my home) you can prepare it on the cooktop.  I add only a small amount of sugar and about 1/4 cup of half and half and it is smooth and delisious.  Sometimes I add fruit or nuts, not always as I love it plain.  I intend to buy more when I finish what I purchased.  Highly recommended.
1396	5	Very flavorful beans, a little spicy but not hot.  Curry flavor is tasty but not hot.  Excellent by themselves or over rice.  Wonderful flavor for vegetarian.
1397	5	I used to Not eat prunes. I tried these & found that I really like them(not so with many of the other brands of prune), the flavor was pretty good & I like the fact that these are individually wrapped. The flavor is good. The texture is good. And because they are individually wrapped they do not stick together, also makes them easy to pack into lunches. These are great prunes.
1398	5	sam mills is great stuff at a fine price, though i used to get it with free shipping.  i was also able, previously, to pick and choose which pastas i wanted in what quantity.  those choices are gone, so now i have to entirely fill a kitchen cabinet with pasta because it is all case lots.  in florida pasta can go bad if stored outside of the freezer for too long.<br />when they say mini lasagna, they are not kidding.  i was thinking maybe 4  instead of the usual 8 ....noooo.....you can fit 4 'mini lasagna' on a postage stamp!
1399	5	I, myself, think chestnuts taste like dust and am not sure just what the allure is.  I ordered these for my mom, who has been a chestnut lover for a good portion of her 84 years on this planet, and she liked them very much, so I guess they must be okay.  Last year I purchased a different brand and these measured up.  So for you chestnut afficionados, it's a thumbs up.
1400	5	After receiving these today, I gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.  First, let me describe them.  They are about the circumference of a normal oreo.  On the inside is one chocolate oreo-type cookie, about 1/2 the width of a normal oreo cookie, with a thin layer of creme on one side.  Then the entire cookie is covered with a chocolate/fudge.  Althogther, they're slightly smaller than the typical two cookies with creme inside oreo cookie you're used to seeing.<br /><br />The testers and I agree that they taste pretty good.  The cookie on the inside has a bit of snap to it when you bite into it, and the creme and fudge work well together.  And of course, almost anything tastes better when its covered with chocolate.  I won't go into the ingredients here, but a single serving of 3 cookies has 170 calories.<br /><br />This is an interesting new product from Nabisco, and I like it.  Five stars.
1401	4	I've been using this flour for years, since I learned I was allergic to wheat. This is the best price I've ever found for it, especially with the subscribe and save discount.
1402	1	I love some of their other teas, I'm a chocoholic, and I love hazelnut coffee.  But I HATED this flavor.  It reminds me of the pharmacy's first attempts years ago to flavor medicine--has a wonderful smell but a weird, almost disgusting aftertaste.  It actually made me a bit sick to my stomach!  I'll stick with the Vanilla Chai--very tasty.
1403	5	We really enjoy the Oskri products and when deals come up we often buy in bulk.  We have never tried the granola products but bought both the Almond and Raisin during the last promotion.<br /><br />The family has already eaten the 12 bags of almond granola, it really has a great taste by itself but with milk or in yogurt it really has a great crunch.  The price seems right to what we normally but and since we need gluten free it is nice to get that benefit and not lose the taste.<br /><br />Great job Oskri again on a great taste and good for you product.
1404	4	Short & sweet.  These chocolate delights are hard to find in many areas. I found them on Amazon & bought a case & will surely buy more. Just the thing for that  Chocolate Fix .
1405	5	I ordered this for a friend that loves his pork.  The shipping time was lightning fast, it came in a Styrofoam cooler and was frozen so that was good.  He told me that the product was awesome.  He loved everything that came in the sample pack and plans on ordering some himself.
1406	5	Wheat Free, Gluten Free, Low Sugar and Sodium and very easy to digest.  Nice taste and I feel great afterwards. Excellent for a Healthy Lifestyle.
1407	5	I'm not an oatmeal fan, but I do like cereal so I was very interested in trying this one. The squares have a lightly sweet flavor. You can still taste the oats, though. It's not overpowered by the brown sugar at all. The texture is extremely crunchy and holds up well in milk. Each piece is small enough to be finger food for little ones and grab-able in handfuls for adults. I've been snacking on it dry as well as in a bowl with milk and find it really versatile. Breakfast, lunch, dinnertime, evening snack...this cereal is a healthful option for any of those.
1408	5	this coffee is intense and very yummy!  it has a strong espresso flavor.  i would definitely recommend it and buy it myself again!
1409	5	I love this product, but it is not sold in stores in Arizona and I'm not sure why not.
1410	5	THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA,<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING  REAL BREWER'S YEAST  -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This  Genuine Brewer's Yeast  powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

1411	4	Good: It works wonders on skin. Face doesn't look oily + skin stays soft for longer period.<br /><br />Bad: Smells awfully strong and not too pleasant (actually more like incense stick) so one star less.<br /><br />Again good: That awfully strong smell disappears after first few minutes. (or that is what I think, will have to confirm with my husband on that)
1412	5	I was happily surprised by this tea.  There is a hint of cinnamon smell to it, but it doesn't taste like cinnamon like most coffee substitutes.  I would say the flavor has a bit more cocoa than coffee, but it's still a great caffeine free alternatiev to coffee.  Another drink I would compare it to is a black stout beer (not Guiness, something darker).  I can't wait to try it with milk.  It's bold, dark, has a nice roast flavor, and is not sweet.
1413	4	I love the gummies. They are sweet, fresh, and natural. I kind of wish that they were as good as the Farleys brand and maybe some other brands.
1414	5	First of all, this coconut butter is absolutely DEE-LICIOUS!!<br />As soon as I read the reviews, I went to my local Health Food Store and bought the large 16 oz. jar. I made a banana and coconut butter sandwich on whole wheat toast and it was scrumptious!!!<br />However ...<br />I made the mistake of refrigerating the product.  This morning I couldn't get any out of the jar.<br />Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT refrigerate this coconut butter.  It solidifies in the fridge and becomes hard as ROCK.<br />The jar does say,  refrigeration not recommended .<br />It should say, *** DO NOT REFRIGERATE ***.<br /><br />Edit:<br />BTW, I recently read a review of Tropical Traditions Coconut  cream .<br />Is Coconut cream the same as Coconut butter?<br />Anyone know?
1415	5	This product is very good. I have really been pleased. As usual of Amazon,it arrived in good timely fashion. Thank you.
1416	5	The pecan pie bars are delicious. In texture and taste they are exactly like classic pecan pie filling. These things are so good I wrote the company fan mail. Hopefully they will not respond with a restraining order, I was pretty effusive. If you like pecan pie you should be pretty impressed by these bars.
1417	5	I've used Knorr Boullon Cubes before and was always satisfied with them. Good product. This time when I went to replace them  the store had only Knorr Caldo Con Sabor De Pollo bouillon powder so I purchased this 7.9 ounce jar. Works fine. In fact, I like it better in-as-much as I can adjust the amount much easier and stir the ingredient in much quicker than with the solid cube. I'm not certain why the label would be in Spanish as the product was bought in a store that was British owned. Oh well, such is life.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
1418	4	This is marketed the same way that toothpaste is ( doctor recommended ), which for me, has the opposite effect on credibility. Strangely, this product does not have the usual FDA disclaimer that I've seen on other products ( This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA ).<br /><br />Evaluating this water just as a water, apart from the numerous health benefit claims, it's good. When at room temperature, the taste is a bit strange and off-putting. When refrigerated and served cold, it is very refreshing and clean tasting. Not sure what  Best available pH at 9.5  means.. This statement does not make sense. pH is a measurement of acidity or alkalinity, on a scale of 0-14 (0 being a strong acid, 14 being a strong base). Normal water is neutral at 7.  Hydrates better  than what? What are we comparing this to? Hydrates better than an English muffin? Yes, it certainly does!<br /><br />Most of the other sales bullet points are standard and hardly worth mentioning.. Plastic is type 1 PETE and can be easily recycled, but most beverage bottles are made of #1 or #2. I'm not a fan of bottling water and the claims of reducing carbon footprint are bogus. These bottles have to be shipped across the country, using trucks and airplanes, which is not carbon neutral. It is far more environmentally friendly to get a filter/treatment system and drink your local water supply.
1419	2	I usually like Chips Ahoy, so was eager to try these; they were, unfortunately, a disappointment.  To start, the portion size is incredibly small: two mini cookies equal 150 calories.  And there was just something artificial about the taste.  The chocolate was only okay and the surrounding cookie was fairly blah.  They are, however, chewy so at least that part of the description is accurate.
1420	5	My dogs love these! It's a great treat to give your dog just to make them happy. These are great for the price when you can get free shipping.
1421	5	My young Havapoo was very unhappy when I put him in his cage at night.<br />After I bought this product for him as a treat before going to bed, he is readily willing to enter his cage, munch a few little pieces of the dried liver and go to sleep quite happy. I can recommend this product to all pet lovers.
1422	4	I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!
1423	4	These K-cups have a very good and strong flavor. However, a few of them leaked at the lid when brewed. I would have easily given 5 stars if I didn't have the 'leakers'.
1424	5	THIS HOISIN SAUCE IS TRULY AMAZING...LEE KUM KEE MAKES STELLAR CHILI GARLIC AND HOISIN SAUCES. NO OTHER BRAND WILL DO.<br /><br />I USE THIS SAUCE TO MAKE A WONDERFUL ORANGE BEEF AND VEGETABLE STIR-FRY.  HOISIN SAUCE IS THE ASIAN BBQ SAUCE...IT'S JUST FANTASTIC. SWEET, YET SAVORY...THEY HAVE A UNIQUE RECIPE THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN MATCH, IN MY EXPERIENCE. I'VE TRIED A NUMBER. VH SAUCES MAKES A VERY POOR EQUIVALENT, AND THE SAME GOES FOR OTHER MANUFACTURERS, BOTH AMERICAN AND ASIAN, ALIKE.<br /><br />THE REVIEWER WHO MENTIONS THE SALTY TASTE PROBABLY USED TOO MUCH OF THE HOISIN. YOU NEED TO BALANCE IT WITH OTHER SPICES AND WITH ALL OF YOUR INGREDIENTS.  I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND A 'LOW SODIUM' BBQ SAUCE OR OTHER MARINADE, WHICH HAS QUITE THE SAME TASTE....SO YES, THERE IS SODIUM IN THIS BRAND/FORMULATION. HOWEVER, IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT WITHOUT IT. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT AT ALL, IF YOU USE THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNTS. IF YOU'RE UNSURE, JUST FIND A RECIPE AND FOLLOW IT. LEE KUM KEE PUBLISHES RECIPES ON THEIR WEBSITE AS WELL, SO THAT WOULD ALSO BE ONE PLACE TO LOOK, IF YOU AREN'T SURE WHAT TO DO.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY.<br />KUDOS TO AMAZON FOR CARRYING THIS.  I HOPE THAT THEY WILL GET THE LARGER SIZE BOTTLE IN SOON. I GO THROUGH THIS LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW!
1425	5	These are the best figs I've ever eaten.  You can get these year round.  They are<br />really tasty, especially this time of year.  Try them you will like them.
1426	5	This is an amazing pepper shaker, however it is not as big as I imagined. I love the spices and I would consider ordering more at a later date. I would recommend it to anyone who has craving for insanly hot food. I myself am a spice lover and I wish you all the best in your spicy endevors. Thanks for the wonderful product Amazon.
1427	5	I have purchased these several times.  They are always raved by everyone as the best black licorice.  It's hard for me to find in the stores but Amazon makes it easy.
1428	4	I saw this brand for the first time at a local supermarket yesterday and figured for $6.49 for a box of 12 (that's 54 cents a cup), I'd give it a try.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, its not actually a plastic K Cup but a rigid rim with a foil lid attached to a filter filled with coffee. The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the  Keurig  co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out. Really, who wants 80 cups of something you might not like? But now I know it's a winner, I'll be getting them here regularly where they are even more affordable.
1429	5	I'm reading the other reviews and I'm quite shocked!!!<br />This is absolutely one of the best commercial coffee blends you can find out there. not too bitter not to sweet, excellent crema, delightful!<br />I have a Gaggia espresso machine, I drink it every morning and occasionally make cappuccino to my guests, they all L-O-V-E it.<br />Warmly recommended, light years better than the sour-greasy-burnt American coffee (Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Peet's etc...)
1430	1	Nothing else matters, the engineering on this thing will fail, and soon.  No matter how convenient or easy, no matter the choices of coffee, forget everything else- there is a huge problem with the way they made the maker itself.  The hinged clam-shell of the K-cup holder uses an amazingly poorly designed plastic track.  This track is formed in a complex set of curves that the mated piece must follow.  The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic.  Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam-shell.  When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K-cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece.  This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K-cup during the brew.<br />Once this happens, you will never know if the next brew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere.<br />Just Google Keurig hole problem.  It is common and after taking this thing apart to see how it all works, obvious that the design is flawed.
1431	4	I'm a big fan of Bags on Board 100% biodegradable bags.  The construction of the bags are sturdy and dependable, which makes cleaning up after your pet easy.  The various colors are a nice touch to a good product!
1432	1	So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame.
1433	3	The peanut brittle was very good, but the packaging was terrible.  The candy all stuck together making one  BIG  piece of candy.  We had to crush the package & eat the candy like  kibbles & bits.  Because of this, we would not buy again.  Perhaps they should insert wax paper between the pieces to keep them separate.
1434	5	I make coffee and espresso from Lavazza Crema e Gusto every morning. My friends love my coffee and Lavazza made with spring water is my secret.
1435	5	Prior to purchasing a five pound bucket of The Sprout House's Hard Wheat Organic Sprouting Seeds, I was paying roughly half as much for five meager ounces of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HAVPLO >Petlinks System Nibble-Licious Seeds</a>, which I had very little luck growing.  At that price per ounce, it certainly didn't leave much room for experimentation, much less perfecting cat grass based growing techniques.<br /><br />After purchasing five pounds of organic seeds from The Sprout House, I know how to grow wheatgrass like a champ and still have at least four pounds of seeds left.  The method that works best for me is to soak the seeds overnight in a mason jar (with a homemade sprouting lid), completely drain the jar the next morning and then rinse the seeds every few hours until they've sprouted nicely.  At that point, I put a very shallow layer (about half an inch) of organic soil in a seed tray, layer the sprouted seeds on top, moisten the soil and seeds, cover with a sheet or two of wet newspaper & make sure the soil and paper stay damp (but not overly wet).  In a few days, the grass is high enough to push the newspaper off, at which point, I let it have ambient light.  In a few more days, I've got a thick (and gorgeous), miniature lawn for my cats to graze on.<br /><br />I only use about 3/4 cup of seeds for a seed tray that's roughly 10  x 21 , so it's obviously a lot of grass for the money (especially given the insane cost of pre-grown cups of cat grass sold in pet stores).  My point is that even if you don't have a green thumb or have been put off by the thought of growing your own cat grass (or people grass), five pounds of seeds will be enough to prove how easy and cost effective it is to grow yourself.<br /><br />And yes, the bucket is awkward and hard to open, but there isn't any law that says you have to keep these seeds in the bucket.
1436	4	this stuff works great however it took almost three weeks to make it to my house. its very tastey and it smells wonderful
1437	5	I'll confess that Bob's Red Mill Teff Flour is the ONLY teff flour I have ever purchased -- but I've been pleased with it from the start, so why try anything else?  The flour I have received from Amazon has always arrived in good, fresh condition.<br /><br />Teff can be used to make tasty gluten-free breads, cookies, waffles, and more, and it is one of the most nutritious gluten-free flours available.  For longest shelf life, slip unopened bags of the flour into zippered freezer bags and put them in the freezer or refrigerator until needed.
1438	2	I bought this product and openend it up. To my horror the skin and bone were included. We have designated the whole 30 cans as cat food now. I designated 2 stars for the quality, it smelled good and looked good but I was pretty upset when it was unedible.
1439	5	Vendor provided quick service and a fresh product packaged securely.  The O Boy Oberto Cocktail Pep tasted just the way I remembered.
1440	5	My Dogs go crazy for the Beef MarroBone, and I have 3 large dogs, so the price and automatic shipping every few months is a big plus for me, in addition, it's good for them, not many Dog treats are, so glad I found this company to do business with, try it you'll like it
1441	4	I ordered this tea to drink while pregnant because I have heard it helps with labor.  I haven't gone into labor yet but it's good tea and nice to have a warm drink.
1442	5	I love drinking this tea, I am able to go through all 6 packs myself over a couple semesters at school. I drink it at least once per day. Tastes absolutely amazing with KAL Stevia, highly recommended to try pairing the two! I love the licorice taste mixed with the peppermint. Perfect before bed.<br /><br />PROS<br />+Value (Amazon offers a consistent solid value on Yogi teas).<br />-Tastes amazing with Stevia.<br />+Great post-dinner treat.<br /><br />CONS<br />+Herbal tea versus green tea, some may argue the benefits are greater from green tea, but I love the taste of this tea, so I tent to drink it more making it more beneficial in my eyes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />If your thinking about ordering this tea, grab some Stevia to go with it (I would recommend KAL brand, known to have less aftertaste) and you like peppermint and licorice, order this tea! Brew yourself a cup of tea, and add one to three servings of Stevia depending on the size, and enjoy!
1443	5	I came to Amazon looking for African coffee when Green Mountain raised their shipping rates to $30 for 1-2 lbs to Hawaii, making it just too expensive to maintain.  It is practically impossible to find African coffee here, which is why I had been getting it by mail to begin with, and my early experiments were not very satisfying.  I bought <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHATY >Coffee Bean Direct Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a> and found it to be burned, bitter.  At the time I thought it was better than none at all, and so tried their Kenya AA (actually, it was Kenya AB, which I had never seen offered before) at which point I figured they were just buying lesser beans, and so the search continued.  I tried a sampler from Coffee masters <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UFSOXE >Coffee Masters Around The World In Twelve Coffees Variety Pack, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)</a> and was overall pretty impressed, so I subscribed to several of their single origin roasts.  The yirgacheffe is very nice, not the very best I have ever had, but way way better than what I got from coffee bean direct.  Recently I received a notice of a price increase prior to my subscription shipment, and so decided to try <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW >Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>.  That was nice coffee, mild and smooth, but did not have the distinctive taste of Ethiopian coffee, and so I am back :)<br /><br />The Coffee Masters roast is just about right for the coffee, a medium roast which brings out the chocolately undertones (which I missed with the Equal Exchange roast).  I have received several shipments, all were fresh, roasted right: no complaints whatsoever (but for the price increase ;)  This is the best African coffee I have found on Amazon thus far, and I have tried at least half a dozen.  That is not to say there may not be a better one lurking which I have not tried, but I am more than satisfied with this and so just reupped my subscription.<br /><br />I you do not typically order single origin coffee, or are not looking for a certain distinctive taste you would probably like the equal exchange more than I did.  It is a nice cup of coffee, but in my opinion, this one is better.<br /><br />  This is a nice coffee' mild, smooth and non-acidic, what's more, it tastes like single origin Yirgacheffe complete with the floral nose and chocolate finish.  I am looking forward to starting my day right again!
1444	3	Great shipping, timely.  However, beware of the label (not listed on the Amazon.com ad) that these are very small pill pockets (barely big enough for one little tablet).  They are not the product we thought we were getting  for capsules .  It's hard to see that with the information they give you on the web.
1445	2	I have been looking for a replacement for the Harry and Davids fig Balsamic, which had a soft moderate balsamic flavor.  This product is not very close to that.
1446	1	The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it). I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental.
1447	5	This appears to be a good way to (i) know the extent of your flea problem by gathering useful statistics and (ii) eliminating at least some of the statistics.  Also, with low wattage lamp can leave on all day.  Getting the sticky pad in place is tricky, but the tips of two pencils help to get it into place.
1448	5	Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.
1449	5	I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.
1450	5	I love this peanut butter!  It does have sugar but not a lot.  My kids love it too and it's pretty healthy for them.  Love it!
1451	5	A co-worker recently bought this in to work from an island vacation.  It was so good, it was gone within seconds of opening it!  I searched for it and was lucky to find it on Amazon and pretty decent prices!  Once I received it, my husband and I dug into this and it was extremely good!<br />It is the perfect cake!  moist through out, sweet with a slight pungent sweet rum aroma and flavor.  Yum Yum!<br /><br />My new favorite type of cake!  It is pretty lethal, and pretty saturated with sugar, so be careful!
1452	5	I purchased this walnut butter about a month ago.  It is already gone!!  My family loved it!  It has a wonderful creamy texture and is great on an apple or dipped out of the container with a spoon :)  I will be buying more today!  Thank you for a great product.
1453	5	Very fresh..Unwashed seeds....Good Price at only $5 dollars per pound shipped...Great for tea use...Fresg from the field...They shiiped very fast ...2Days
1454	1	We use a lot of Earth's Best products and are quite happy with most of them. Not so these teething biscuits. My daughter fulfilled all the  requirements  listed on the box, e.g. she can crawl, gums food, etc., but she still got a big piece of these stuck in her throat and started chocking. There is nothing more scary than finding your nanny hold your child upside down trying to get a piece of food out.<br />I don't recommend these. They should be recalled, or at least not called  teething  biscuits, more like  toddler  biscuits.
1455	5	These are a staple in our pantry.  I love mashed potatoes, but who has time for scrubbing and prepping potatoes (Except for the holidays!)?  And up until I found these I would not buy the conventional brands of instant mashed potatoes.  Mainly because they are not organic and also because they don't taste very good.  Potatoes are on the top 12 list of vegetables with the most pesticides; stick with organic!  The Edwards and Sons Organic Mashed Potatoes taste really good!  Granted nothing beats scratch made mashed potatoes, but these are the best of the instant.  They are excellent made with milk and butter, but they are also great with rice milk (if you are vegan or have a dairy issue) and no butter.  Actually, my husband has said that they seem to mix up nicer with rice milk.  We have found that when using the specified amounts of liquid, the mashed potatoes are very thick, so we add more milk or rice milk than directed.  The instant potatoes also work great as a thickener for stews, soup, and gravy.  The flavor is mild, but tasty with a bit of onion and black pepper.  There is also a  chreesy  (non-dairy cheese flavored) version, which I don't like as much.  Our daughter likes the chreesy version better however.  These are also gluten free!  I was buying them by the case from an online discount vitamin store, but Amazon seems to be coming down on their food prices and with Subscribe and Save, they currently have the best price.
1456	4	Let me preface this by saying I purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less. I was pleasantly surprised with this drink. It tastes great, but definitely a little tangy. What I loved about this was how great I felt after drinking it. I felt awake and focused, and just overall really good. I will definitely be buying more.
1457	4	These have a taste and texture surprisingly close to my favorite brand of super-thin pretzel twists.  With the added benefit of only 1.5 grams of fat but 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein.  I do wish they came in  serving  size packages instead, though.
1458	2	HAVE ORDERED THIS BRFORE AND THIS TIME JUST DOESNT SEEM AS FRESH. WHEN I OPENED , THE CONTENTS SEEMED STALE, BUT THE DATE ON THE PACKAGE WAS OCT2013.....COULD HAVE BEEN A PIN HOLE IN BAG AND I COULDN'T FIND IT.
1459	5	My dog loves it and goes crazy for it! Also, other dogs (I was visiting my parent-in-law) went crazy for this treat. However, I must say this treat stinks so bad. You have to wash your hands after you touch them. =(
1460	5	I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?
1461	5	We call this crack for cats because our cats love this food so much.. they are always screaming for more of it ..
1462	3	I love these and my 8 month old loves them but I don't think the product canister does a good job of keeping them fresh.  It seems like they go stale VERY fast.  I don't think the baby cares but since I eat them with her it bothers me.
1463	4	These Chips were amazing. Best chips I have had in a long time. They are kind of like the sweet bag of dried fruit you normally get to snack on, but these are vegetables. I got the Ala Mexican flavored kind and they are great. However, they are even better with salsa if you want more flavor. Great new chip to try.
1464	5	Just as good as the originals.  A great sweet treat for anyone who loves gummy candies but is watching sugar and or carbs.
1465	3	I've bought the smaller package of the same cat food at the store before. It was kind of expensive but I wanted to keep buying organic food for my beloved kitty. And I found this deal on Amazon. I was going to keep buying some kind of organic cat food anyways and I didn't have to drive store to store to find the organic cat food that I can buy locally. So it was the perfect solution for me!<br /><br />I wrote this about 3 months ago. Now my cat won't eat much just with the dry cat food by itself. That started over a month ago. I thought he got sick so I took him to a vet. She said, she doesn't see any problems. Now I read all the reviews and it all makes sense. He just don't like this cat food. He still asks for more food after I feed this food. So I needed to buy organic wet canned food to mix so that he'll eat something at least. I mean I want something really healthy for my kitty to live longer, but it concerns me if he doesn't eat because of food... But I don't wanna go back to the junky cat food with lots of bad stuff that he loves... I don't know what to do!
1466	5	We love these healthy snacks. When my daughter takes them to school in her lunch, everyone at the table wants some!
1467	5	The Purrfectly Chicken is the only pouch variety all the cats love. That's 5 inside spoiled rotten princes and princesses aged 6 to 13 and anywhere from 2 to 5 outside feral cats.I can deal with the inconvenience of pouches spilling chicken juice but wish I were sure they were eating a quality product. The fact that they're from Thailand bothers me. The dark pieces are always left in the bottom of the bowls.
1468	1	My cat isn't a picky eater, but she had no interest in eating Pill Pockets. I was hopeful about these things, but my cat didn't even recognize that they were supposed to be eaten. Rolled it around, poked at it, sniffed it, and moved on. I can't imagine they are very fragrant or flavorful to get that kind of reaction since she eats everything else she sees. Glad to see others had success, but we weren't impressed.
1469	3	I was a bit disappointed in the brownies I made last night with this cocoa. I used the same recipe (from bag of King Arthur flour) that I always use and it didn't turn out so great. It was edible, but not as good as it usually is. I have used several different cocoas in the past and most recently used Guittard. I think I may try using Valrhona or Pernigotti; anyone have an opinion on either of these?
1470	5	These Kettle potato chips are great. I love the krinkle cut because it gives the chip great texture when eating it. Those thick ridges also allows more of the seasoning to stay on the chip. The pepper in this really stands out so if you're not a fan of fresh ground pepper flavor then don't buy this. These chips are rich, bold and delicious. The quality of the potatoes used are excellent. I can't wait to try the other flavors.
1471	5	Wild bills beef jerky is the very good and worth the money but you can get it from the wild bills website for $25.00.
1472	5	This is one of our very favorite sauces for many meals. It is great for meats, egg dishes, cassaroles and other applications.  We have bought this by the case in the past! Glad we can still purchase it.
1473	3	This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend.  If you like that, you'll like this.  Generally, the GM product costs less, but this was on sale.
1474	1	Received this today. It was not good at all. Maybe I was just spoiled by another online company who specialized in dried fruits and nuts. I had only had their dried strawberries before. Their strawberries were accual strawberry size and excellants taste. These just a little larger than a raisin and don't taste very good. They took the rotten strawberries from the patch to make these. I will have to use them in salads, if I use them at all. I don't usually review products. But felt I had to review this one.
1475	5	This is my Mothers and Husbands favorite brand of chai.  Decaf or reg.  It smells and taste divine.
1476	5	Not too acidic, not too bitter -very well balanced. Have used wtih no problem at 6 months after expiration date on package. Just seemed a little  clumpy  at that point but tasted fine.  Much better value per unit than smaller packaging.  I ordered off the Starbucks site directly at this price, didn't notice a short expiration so wonder if it is Amazon fulfillment issue?
1477	4	My 18 month old loves this mac & cheese.  It is pretty bland tasting, but he's never had the Kraft version to compare it to.  I always mix in a bag of frozen broccoli and he eats it all.  It is nice to have on hand for a quick meal and to know I'm not succumbing to an artificially-laden, cancer-causing convenience food :(
1478	5	It's true that these bones don't last long, but I don't think they were intended to so don't pay much attention to the sour grape reviews.  Yes, they're expensive, but they aren't meant to be fed to your dog every day.  It's a TREAT for them, not a chew toy.  So be aware of what you're buying.  This isn't a chew bone; it's a very special treat.
1479	4	I still like the old dove better but this one is ok.I like this one better though: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5M0OE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i01<br />But again, everyone has different opinion..
1480	5	My dentist told me to stop sipping carbonated diet soda all day because the carbonation was hard on my teeth (who knew?), so I've switched to drink mixes. I use this, frequently mixed with the pomegranate variety in a large jug, and I'm good to go. I also frequently mix one of these with the new K2O pink lemonade with protein & fiber since weight loss is always an issue, and this definitely perks up the somewhat bland pink lemonade. I'm on subscribe & save which makes this a real bargain.
1481	5	Or just anytime you want a nice comfort food.  I'm not sure why but this tea is one of my comfort foods, I love the smell, and the smooth taste.  It has a nice aroma that relaxes me, but at the same time is a pick me up.  I usually add a bit of cream or honey and it makes the perfect cup.
1482	5	Excellent tea.  Normally I am a black tea drinker, but this is an exception.  Superb when you have a cold or tummy ache.  A must have on hand tea.
1483	4	So, these were sort of bland, but I sure can't complain about the quality.  If you want your sardines firm and fresh without all the oil and without the scales and the bones, this is a great choice.  I'll bet if they were mashed up and mixed with mayo and relish and served to me, I'd think I was eating tuna!
1484	2	Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate.
1485	3	The picture for the  Hairball  type shows a green bag that is labeled,  Weight and Hairball Control .  This is what I normally get for my cats.  However, the bags that arrived were orange and just state,  Hairball Control.   I'm keeping them because my cats will eat it and it's easier than returning them.  However, I would like to actually get what I think I'm paying for.
1486	5	I bought this item and was amazed to get the great taste of truffles while not having to manage how expensive or difficult it is to cook with fresh truffles.  I can't wait to try the other flavors but add this to pasta or top over a sole like fish and even my kids were in heaven tasting.  Finally something easy for preparing truffles...
1487	4	Good stuff. My dogs have been eating this for several years and they seem to like it better than some other brands I had tried. I stuck with this food because, well, the dogs like it, but also because it's one of the few canned dog foods that don't cause either digestive or allergy issues with either of my 2 dogs. It's nice to have the mix of flavors so they're not eating the same flavor every morning. They eat this for breakfast then they eat the same brand of dry varieties the rest of the day. Seems like a nice, healthy diet.
1488	4	At the rec'd microwave time, though, unless you move them to another bowl or plate, they took FOR-EVER to cool. Nice flavor, purchase at Costco for much cheaper if you can.
1489	4	Tried the popcorn on my little bambino popper machine . I am very happy with the results . most of it pops the flavor taste is excellent will recommend it .
1490	5	There are only 6g of carbs per serving. Only 1 gram of sugar per serving, vs 4g in a similar brand.<br /><br />(Good Fat): 3g polyunsaturated, and 8g monounsaturated<br />+ 1g saturated fat<br /><br />The reason these almonds are awesome, is because the chocolate is real, and it tastes sugary enough to feel like you are really eating something delicious, while having a very very low sugar content. Also according to an article I will cite below about the health benefits of almonds,  Almond's Healthy Fats May Help You Lose Weight. <br /><br />I didn't even suspect that they used sucralose until someone pointed it out to me. You can't taste it.<br /><br />There is something about these almonds that never quite satisfy your sugar craving, but you will eventually get full from the sheer number of almonds you will eat, and can snack guilt-free.<br /><br />Because these almonds have low sugar content, they taste like a chocolate snack, while actually providing you with many health benefits, including weight loss, and you can't get enough.<br /><br />Health benefits:<br />[...]
1491	5	I hate cauliflower. HATE IT.<br /><br />However, this doesn't taste like caulifower. It just tastes like Kraft Mac & Cheese. It's good. It's yummy. It may not be all that much more healthy, but it's a neat trick and I think it's probably better than eating more wheat flour in my diet.<br /><br />It's easy to make, tastes good, and it's affordable. I'd still suggest eating some real vegetables as a side dish, but every little bit helps, eh?<br /><br />I recommend it. Give it a shot... Even if you hate cauliflower.
1492	1	I ordered the chocolate mix and recieved the plain mix (with the chocolate mix packing order included of course)... One star for the people with one brain cell doing fufillment at the  Unprepared Pantry ...
1493	5	After cleaning out the grocery store of this tea multiple times, we though it was time to get serious and buy it in bulk. Tea was fresh, came fast, good price, free shipping.
1494	1	I bought this hot sauce because it was salt free and I was trying to eliminate as much salt as possible from my diet. This was the worst tasting hot sauce I have ever had in my life. Now I know it is not going to taste like regular hot sauce but I didn't think that it would actually make the food taste worse.<br /><br />I am sorry but I would not recommend this hot sauce at all.
1495	3	This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.
1496	1	I don't know how this seller got these, in Italy every box and every single sealed package inside the box has a clearly printed expiration date and these don't. The Plasmon biscuits are the best you can find in the world but not from this seller!! I thought selling babyfood with no expiration date was inlegal and honestly these taste as already expired. Amazon should take action! Stay away
1497	5	It is Co2 decaf so no chemicals are used in removing the caffeine, just carbon dioxide and we all breath that out. We find it to be a smooth coffee.
1498	4	We normally use the powder formula but this is not that much more money and it is easier to use. The formula seems thicker than powder formula and if its anything like the difference between powdered milk and real milk it probably tastes better too. Our baby is almost 6 months old and a thicker milk is probably a good ramp up to more solid foods. We like sensitive because it is gentler on the stomach than regular formula so for the price this is a good buy.<br /><br />Only thing that has been spotty is the shipping, generally the package comes very quick, usually in 3 days from order but sometimes longer. The packaging has been strange also, the first order came in a big plastic bag with no padding. The box was breaking open and 2 bottles had dents on them. The formula seemed ok but was a strange package indeed. The second came in a regular box over another box and was much better padded. I am glad they are packaging better because I almost stopped ordering this from Amazon for that reason. At this point all is good.
1499	5	I ordered this back in October through subscribe and save, and it arrived promptly and in good shape.  I then wrapped it up and -- two months later -- drove it nine hours north to Wisconsin as part of a Christmas gift basket for my parents in Waukesha, not having noticed that it's actually made by a family-owned business further north in this state.  Not only was this a good price for pure maple syrup (grade B, with strong maple flavor that goes a long way on a stack of pancakes), but it was a nice surprise to find that Wisconsin maple syrup is just as flavorful as that from New England.
1500	5	The best coffee I have tried yet.  Better than Starbucks, Tullys and even Seattles Best which I like.
1501	4	Great product, worked out really well, my wife loves the taste.<br />All of the Red Mill products are fantastic.
1502	5	This is seriously the best meal replacement drink I've ever tried, and nutritionally , nothing else really compares. I love that it is organic, and I LOVE that there are no artificial sweeteners in it. I have these on a delivery system to my home, and I'll keep it that way for a long time. Worth every penny.
1503	4	I've eaten Wasa for more than 15 years - long before Oprah and Dr. Oz talked about how great it was for people regarding fiber, whole grains and lack of fat, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />As long as the packers pack these well, and UPS is careful, it is great. I had one problem wheere the box was hit hard and the crackers inside got smashed. But they were replaced. Otherwise a 5 star rating for the Wasa product itself! No  insects  or anything else. Long expire date and very fresh.
1504	5	I'm always skeptical when buying from the lowest priced vendor, but I'm happy to say these are AT LEAST as good as any pig ears you will find in the store. The only difference is you'll be paying half as much. Free shipping makes this a no-brainer. The case comes with 4 ziplock bags of 25. I'm almost into the 4th bag now, and all the pieces have been nice sized. Not once have I seen a puny treat, so I'll be placing another order soon.
1505	5	This is the perfect treat: small (so your dog doesn't get fat), extremely healthy, and very fairly priced (especially per treat--about 2 cents a treat.  Oh yes, and my dog loves it.
1506	4	I recently visited California and fell in love (again) with Corn Nuts.  Upon returning to NC I realized that I can't find them anywhere!  (I did find some that were 1 year old, dusty, still on the convenience store shelf.  I bought them)  Thankfully I can order them here!  Whew!
1507	5	Coffee is the most important meal of the day, right?  So why settle for plain old java?  This is the absolute BEST flavor I have ever tasted in a K-Cup hands down!  Goes great with some Italian Sweet Cream Coffeemate =)
1508	1	Someone opened and took one of the apple sauce cups.  Sure help yourself to my toddler's snack.  I won't order from here again.  I'm not down with the 5 finger discount.
1509	5	I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.
1510	5	I love this granola! I picked it up on a whim at a Marshall's in their specialty food section and now buy it online because I can't find it anywhere else! To me, this is what granola should be - big, crunchy clusters, lots of fruit, not too sweet, just a hadful of nuts. The ingredients list can't be beat, either - only whole, natural foods, ingredients you can pronounce, no GMOs, no HFCS, no refined sugars. Just tasty ingredients. The recloseable bag makes it so easy to just keep stashed in my bag to snack on throughout the day.
1511	5	I got PB2 powdered peanut butter for mixing in with my morning shakes. I absolutely love it! It tastes great and mixes in great with no clumps. I love 2 T for 45 calories as opposed to 200 in regular peanut butter. It says you can mix with water to make a solid peanut butter, but I haven't tried that yet. I've already bought my second order which included the chocolate PB2 and love that just as much! For more on my thoughts on PB2, visit: [...]
1512	3	I feel the product has changed somewhat. Perhaps it's me!  I don't care for<br />this coffee any longer.  I may buy it in the grocery store if it's on sale<br />for a low price.
1513	5	I have bought two boxes of these now and love them.  My first box came from a local health food store and the second came from Amazon.  Yum Yum.  As a Vegan I never heard of these, but I have seen them on the shelf at my local health food store.  So one day I bought two packs.  I loved them.  Went back and bought the rest of the box.  That store could not get them in fast enough so I bought from Amazon.  I really like them.  The lime flavor is the one that I have tried.  I will try the other flavors soon.
1514	3	to small to work in an air popper.  It just spits out the seeds everywhere. :(
1515	3	I like my coffee strong, french roast (Timothy's) but this Jet fuel is not enjoyable.
1516	5	Mrs. Wage's Ketchup mix is the only brand I have found. It is simple and easy to make. Not to mention it taste good.
1517	5	These Jumbo Medjool Dates are excellent. I love dates and tried many different kinds and brands from local stores and the internet. These are definitely the best. Also, fast delivery, I received the dates withing 3 business days from order date.
1518	5	I have been eating this stuff almost every day for several years and I still love it.  It is especially good in a fruit smoothie.
1519	5	Excellent product. I gave this as a gift and the recipient thought it was a great mix and was very pleased.
1520	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPKRW2 >Pasta Roni Garlic & Olive Oil Vermicelli Mix, 4.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> is a delicious meal for two.  It has 240 calories per serving plus the butter suggested on the package.  I chose to use olive oil instead and to half the amount.  There are some problems with cooking pasta that the box cannot solve.  For example, it is possible to overcook the noodles or to make the sauce too dry or too thin.<br /><br />I decided to add something.  The package suggested deli smoked turkey or ham strips and sliced ripe olives.  I tried a few chopped onions and sliced mushrooms. I sauteed them in the olive oil before adding the water and packaged ingredients.<br /><br /> Then I looked in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook at Mike's Ma's Lasagna and found the meatball recipe there.  Yum! With meatballs, it was quite a dish.
1521	1	My dog will not touch this food. Very surprised because all reviews were positive. He will not eat it with chicken added or anything else. I am aware of a recall on some of the Wellness brand but this food was not included in the recall.
1522	2	The low acidity of this coffee is probably a good thing for folks that have trouble with that sort of thing. I found the taste to be lacking and a bit bitter. I brewed it weak and strong and prefered it on the weak side.  It's not a bad tasting coffee just not my cup of...coffee.
1523	5	VERY DISAPPOINTED IN RECENT PRICE INCREASE FOR THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />Not sure what is going on - but I purchased three 16 oz cans for $14 in January with FREE shipping on $25 (I ordered other items) and now I see that they sell six 12 oz cans for nearly $30!(still had free shipping)<br /><br />Previous order was .29 per oz. and now it is .41 per oz. What gives? Other sellers on Amazon are even higher. So, I guess I won't be stocking this item again any time soon unless the price drops. I love using it in pancakes and waffles - but will just buy liquid buttermilk instead.
1524	3	Does it matter if things are healthy if they don't taste very good?  This multi-grain chips may be packed with goodness, but they taste like a stale wheat thin that was left sitting in a bag of real tortilla chips for awhile and managed to pick up a bit of their flavor.  I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.  But anyone looking to chow down on some tortilla chips isn't going to be too happy, and would have to force themselves through a bag of these rather than eating what they really wanted.<br /><br />Unless you covered them with cheese and made nachos.  Because that makes everything taste better!
1525	5	I love these little candies! They are great for a sore throat or a sweets craving. I got my first bag at Whole Foods, but I would definitely order them in bulk next time! :)
1526	5	My little dog has alot of food sensitivities, mostly grains, so I thought I would try this food for him.  I bought a can at the local pet store before I committed myself to a whole case.  Glad I did.  He liked it OK, didn't love it, but I was worried about giving him liver all the time.  I did a google search about giving dogs liver and it recommended no more than 3 times a week or it causes some kind of vitamin A toxicity.  Anyway, I may end up giving it to him just a few times a week, because I do like this manufacturer.  I have spoken to them and they really are a quality food company with human grade products.
1527	5	Nordic Berries, orignally recommend by my pediatrican. my kids love them, as a matter of fact so do adults. they are natural and great tasting. however, you do have to hide them because kids think there candy. my 2 year old and 4 year old take them.
1528	5	Since a lot of allergy issues stem from what dogs are being fed, this is an excellent treat for your allergy prone dog.  You'll know them by their skin and ear issues.  While most dog treats remind me of beef jerky, these actually remind me of wheat granola bars.  They are medium sized bars that are scored in the middle so you can break them in half.  I have 3 dogs of all sizes:  110lb Chocolate Lab, 15lb Miniature Pinscher, 1lb Chihuahua.  All three dogs love this treat.  I give the whole piece to the Lab and then break another in half and give 1 half to the MinPin and the other half to the Chihuahua.  The first two devour this treat in seconds but it takes the Chihuahua half a day to make it through the treat.  I think that's good.  It gives him something to do and it'll clean his teeth too.  The treat is very crumbly if they break it apart.  My dogs always clean up the crumbs afterwards, but probably shouldn't feed this treat to them on the carpet.  All in all - I would highly recommend this product as a good, healthy, tasty treat for dogs that is hypoallergenic and can help break the tartar off their teeth.  It smells very clean and fresh, like a granola bar and the dogs love it!
1529	3	I've been searching for a no-corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away...tried Halo which was great but so expensive.  This is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to Halo, but....oh boy.  I'm just glad it's warm enough to have the windows open!  My dog loves the taste and the quality seems great, so we'll try 2 more days to see if things settle down.
1530	5	This is the only formula that I've given to my baby that she doesn't spit up on. Amazon has the best prise and the 4 pack makes it very convienient to get. Free shipping makes it all that much easier.
1531	3	You just lost another long-term customer from a dedicated GF family.  Was a pretty good GF cereal.  There are other options now for GF cereal, though.  Maybe I'll also start eating more fruit for breakfast.
1532	5	Like I said good to the last drop and just 'bold' eoungh to shake out the cobwebs in the am. And now they say a couple of cups are good for the heart. Sortda like dark beer. Anyway it was another excellent Amazon transaction.
1533	5	They are so soft and great chocolate taste. They are made with whole grains but no one will ever know.
1534	4	These are hard to find in my area so I am glad Amazon carries them. These are very tasty little nuggets. Tasty and filling. Volume-wise, the portion seems a bit small to warrant 150 calories, but I'll take these over chips any day.
1535	5	My family absolutely loves this rice.  It has a nice nutty, sweet flavor that is excellent cooked plain and then just eaten with butter.  Also cooks up beautifully for pilafs.  This is my 3rd time ordering this because my daughter keeps asking if we can  Please have that good rice with butter for dinner.   This is the most flavorful rice I have ever used.
1536	3	This is so far my favorite.<br />I usually eat heart to heart.I tried island vanilla and i loved it.<br />I got this strawberry fields at local market for 2.99 and<br />island vanilla for same price. It wasn't surprising sale or anything. They always have that price. I looked it up on amazon and i was so shoked.<br />The price is too expensive here. i thought amazon provide lowest food prices.But i figured it is not even close to low.
1537	2	I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans.
1538	5	this is extremely great tasting coffee if you are trying to quit coffee or just don't want the caffeine this is what you need to try
1539	5	Chocolate cherry kind bars are yummy, and one of the lower calorie kind bars. I order by subscribe and save and I had to increase the frequency.  A real treat - love em!<br />Reviews are misleading.  I can tell that a lot of the reviews are for other flavors of kind bars, not cherry chocolate.  No one would say they are peanutty!  They are chocolaty and chewy and cherry-ie and delightful.
1540	5	I love good coffee and for medical reasons must drink Decaf.  Emeril's Dark Magic Decaf tastes rich and flavorful, just like real caffinated coffee.
1541	5	These 100 calorie Cakesters are delicious!  Both the vanilla<br />and the chocolate are great, they satisfy those little  sweet <br />cravings and its only 100 calories for three little cakes!
1542	4	This tea has been one of my longtime favorites.  At first I was skeptical about buying a 100 bag box....but it's GREAT!  Now I have tea on hand all the time at a great price.<br /><br />Enjoy!
1543	5	I bought this curry paste for a recipe and followed the recipe instructions and failed to look at the recommended serving size on the container.  HUGE mistake!  My recipe called for 3TBSP, while the side of the container lists 2tsp as the recommended serving size.  Even after trying to dilute the sauce it is way too hot.  The taste is fabulous but it is HOT, next time I will know to start very, very slow.
1544	5	I normally HATE fake chips.  I don't even really like real chips, but if I'm having a chip, I don't want any of those taro, cassava whatevertheheck kind of chips.  They border on disgusting.  I was tentative to try these when I got them.<br /><br />I was surprised.  These chips are thick, airy and wonderful.  The BBQ flavor is the closest I've had to  real  BBQ chips.  I could eat a whole bag.<br /><br />I wouldn't call them a healthy snack, but they are more healthy than regular chips and quite enjoyable.  I can't believe I like a fake chip!
1545	5	I have a glass of this tea every night before bed. It tastes great and is calming like most Twinings teas I have tried. I can usually get two small glasses of tea out of one K-Cup- Still tastes good and strong ;)
1546	1	I love emeril but he needs to stick to food and stay away from coffee. This was the most bitter coffee I have ever had. Yuk
1547	4	I just received the spice bottle of this ghost pepper salt. Large crystals like you'd expect from sea salt, infused with ghost pepper. I put in a pepper grinder and seasoned some deep fried french fries. Adds a nice flavor and a little bit of kick. I'd say hot store bought mass produced salsa is hotter. Flavor is great though, and I would buy again. If you want something really hot, look elsewhere. If you want nice flavor with a little kick this is a great product.
1548	3	This is a nice healthy cereal but its too heavy for someone with a sensitive stomach.
1549	5	May have been pricey but the wolfhound LOVES this thing.  I'd definitely get it again. It holds up well to heavy chewing.
1550	3	I've been reading amazing things about Cacao, health benefits, etc., so I thought I would purchase these for my family and see if I couldn't  work  them into our routine.  I have to be honest, it really hard as no one in my family (including me) really likes the flavor.  Raw eating is new to me so maybe in a year or so this will be a real treat.  I agree the price and the fact that they are organic is GREAT.  I am still searching for a good idea on how to use them?
1551	5	I love this stuff! I first descovered it at a local QFC and bought it because the bottle was cool.<br /><br />I know it works because I get comments on my performance at work when I drink Bliss.<br /><br />The price on here is steep, since I can usually find it for around $1.50 or less elsewhere but to get this quantity I think it might be worth it.<br /><br />I may even try the multi pack soon!
1552	5	I use these for training my sheltie puppy,and he loves them.  They are a great size, small enough to use for training and I even break them into smaller bits because he's so small.  He loves both the peanut butter and salmon.
1553	5	I have purchased the original glaze, blood orange, ginger, pomegranate and whatever others there are.  I used to make my own by putting balsamic in a pan and reducing it, sometimes flavored with something else.  The Roland glazes are so much easier and just squirt out of the bottle in a nice thin stream.  Great on Bruschetta, pork chops, or whenever you would garnish a dish with thickened reduced balsamic, without the work.  They also last longer and don't end up with crud in the bottom of the bottle after a few weeks, like regular reduced balsamic does.
1554	5	These are great.  They taste good.  Buying the quantity of course comes with the discount.  I think the expiration on them is like a year out.  They are great for energy when out there for an extended period of time.  Of course, I only use them like I use Gatorade, only if I am exercising (biking, running, etc) for 2+ hours.  I like them because it gives me the energy to keep going, but instead of eating something that sits in my stomach and weighs me down, these don't do this, niceeeee.  They are well worth it to me.  With these and Cliff Bars, I can just keep goin.
1555	2	Certainly not worth the price. It's only advantage to using jars is it stacks. Good luck getting a response from the company if you need any information (which is seriously lacking with your purchase). Save your money, use jars.
1556	1	I was so excited to try this based on the other review here but to my disappointed surprise, this is just terrible tasting jelly.  It MUST be an acquired taste. Several of my coworkers tried it too, because I thought I would just give it to someone, and not a single one liked it. Four of us tried it and one described it as like walking into a room recently sprayed rose scented air freshener and getting choked up on it. Definitely do not recommend.
1557	5	The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions...<br />Get them while you can...  Their other flavors are great tooo
1558	5	Every time I open a can, my cat meows like CRAZY... He always thinks it's one of these... Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. So whenever I have soup or whatever, I give him one of these. This is the only kind of food that I KNOW he likes. And it keeps him healthy. I can tell when cat food isn't that good for him. He sheds a little more. But I don't have that problem with this and the other cat food I'm giving him now.
1559	4	I enjoy the product very much, it does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.  It's disgusting to think I ate fruit without it all my life.  My only problem is that half a bottle of the Fit was spilled upon arrival.
1560	5	I am amazed to see so may negative reviews. Best I can guess is that the bottles the negative reviewers tastes were mishandled somehow. Maybe they got too warm or something during shipping.<br /><br />I buy Zico Natural in the plastic bottle from my local grocery store all the time, and they are the closest thing to actual fresh coconut water I have found. I love fresh coconut water, and I absolutely hate anything that tastes like plastic or metal.<br /><br />In fact, I dislike most bottled or canned coconut water because of the off tastes, but I simply don't taste anything wrong with the Zico Natural in plastic bottes.<br /><br />Accuse me of working for Zico if you like, but as you can see I am a long time Amazon user and reviewer.
1561	2	I had a problem with this order.  I was not sent the correct amount.  But amazon took care of that problem for me.  I use Amazon for almost everything I buy.
1562	2	This coffee is sort of grocery store quality-a whole bean folgers maybe. We like Folgers for a change, but we don't like paying these bigger prices for such small quality. It says it is espresso, but it brews very weak. The flavor is fine, but again, weak. We weren't impressed with how it has turned out. The Three Peckered Goat flavor was great, however.
1563	5	I ordered these directly from Sunflower Food & Spice Company when I ordered their Honey Toasted Sunflower Nuts. I just added them to my cart since I was paying shipping anyways and I'm so glad I did. They are the BEST yummiest cashews ever. I only ordered one, but I will definitely order more. The sunflower nuts are delicious too. Highly recommend.
1564	5	I like coffee and buy a lot of different brands. This is my first experience with chicory in coffee. I really like it, it's fine as it is but I blend it in with a medium roast coffee and it's great. Lots of flavor, dark color, but not so bitter as what you get in a french roast.<br /><br />Anyhow great price, Amazon comes thru again. I'll buy more when this is done.
1565	5	Very good product, my wife drinks it all the time. Stash premium licorice to her is very good tasteing.
1566	5	I love this stuff! I have tried the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate and it is so good! Amazon really has a great deal on it. You can get a pump for it here or at their website and it works great!
1567	5	I adopted a dog from rescue shelter who has an allergy to corn. I live in a small town and found no dog food that didn't contain mainly corn. This was perfect and my new pet is doing very well on it and loves it. It's an added bonus that it comes straight to my door.
1568	5	Our Golden Retriever really loves these. Don't give them to him often and use them for a special treat.
1569	4	Turns out to be a little to strong.  Got too wired after a cup.  Replaced it with Coffee People Kona blend which is more to my liking.
1570	5	Lipton loose tea is great for brewing iced tea or hot tea. Mellow yet intensely flavorful, this tea works very well with iced tea makers or coffee brewers. I wouldn't use a coffee maker that's been used for coffee, though, as the coffee effervescence will overpower the tea's flavor. My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1/2 pound boxes. This six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat. We drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee: all the time! So loose tea works great for us (4 TBSP makes about a gallon) It's much easier than messing with a dozen or more tea bags per gallon. With the free shipping, the price per box is equal to or less than the purchase price in our local grocery stores and Wal*Mart stores, and that's with delivery to my front door!
1571	5	After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad.
1572	5	This gluten free pasta cooks up like wheat versions and tastes yummy.  Leftovers are good the next day, too.  Italians really do know how to do gluten free.
1573	5	after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be  ginseng for women  beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to  draw one's energy  downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's  good for you  and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?
1574	4	These taste of these beans is very good.  I would prefer more beans and less liquid, however.
1575	5	I think that HP sauce is the best product of its kind on the market.  It is made in the UK, so it is not readily available in many parts of the US. Accordingly, I was thrilled to see I could order it from Amazon!
1576	5	This box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio & Antioxidants is delicious as is all the Kind Bar products.  They are a great choice for a balanced, satisfying, nutritious bar very low in sodium and without gluten.  LOVE KIND bars.  I will definitely be back for more.  The 12 Pack boxes from Amazon are a GREAT VALUE too!
1577	1	I was extremely dissapointed in this product.  I purchased it because it did not HFC listed on the label.  HFC is not something that I can digest and therefore, since this item can not be returned, it is no use to me, nor would I foster it on someone else.
1578	5	My 6-month-old is a fanatic for these flavors!  She gobbles them up and we can't load the spoon fast enough for her!  We introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well, so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her.  She goes,  Mmm, mmm,  lol.  It's so cute and meats are an easier-to-absorb source of iron compared to artificially-enriched iron that is found in baby cereals.  I definitely prefer this as a compliment to Mommy's milk as oppose to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest.
1579	1	Ordered 6-1 Pound Bags of M&M's (Org, Blk, and Silv). 3 boxes (2 lbs each) arrived of M&M's put directly in tissue paper loose in the box. NOT IN BAGS AS DESCRIBED!  After agruing with me that they are only M&M's and they would still have a long self life, I was told I could return the M&M's, but if any of them were broken I would NOT receive my credit. Now I am supposed to pack them better than originally sent to get my money back? Do Not Order from this seller.
1580	5	I love peanut butter but hate all the calories.  This powder is perfect for adding a dash of flavor to my morning cream of wheat or oatmeal. I won't claim it's 100% responsible for all the weight I lost, but it sure helped me reign in my sweet tooth.
1581	5	I started drinking cytomax at a friend's recommendation and I've never gone back to gatorade or the similar drinks.  The first thing I noticed is that its not packed with the high fructose corn syrup that's found in so many popular drinks.  Keeps me going through hours of workout or basketball with the same hydration as gatorade, if not better.  And as you're mixing it yourself at home, it ends up costing a lot less as well.
1582	5	I had purchased the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QOKSRK >Hartz 8 Oz Dental Pig Ear Pieces  98413</a> for my 8 week old Golden Retriever.  She wanted nothing to do with them.  Then I gave her one of these and she is acting as if I just put a nice juicy steak in front of her (even though she just ate).  Looks like it's going to keep her busy for a while.  We'll see.
1583	1	i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place. I dont know what to do with the whole 4 box, i wasnt even able to drink up the one single cup!
1584	5	As soon as my order arrived (which was fast - 3 days and free shipping) I immediately opened it and fixed myself a Pina Colada and its only 11 am.  This is absolutely the best syrup for shaved ice.  Awesome taste and thickness.  Thank you for making such a nice treat anytime of the year.  I HIGHLY recommend this product and especially the 10 pack for variety.
1585	5	I was amazed!  Shipping was fast and product above my expectations. The lavender smelled so wonderful as I took it out of the box.  I ordered it for a cake I am planning to make but I will have plenty to make vinegars and other things for gifts.  I will be ordering from this seller again!
1586	5	Finally, a nutritious snack that actually tastes good! I normally don't like apricots but this bar is not overpowered by the fruit.  It's the right combination of almond and apricot flavors so that it's not overly sweet or nutty.  I do wish it were a bit bigger in portion.  It doesn't feel like a meal replacement but definitely a good snack. Even if you're not a big apricot fan, I highly recommend giving this one a try.  The monthly delivery service also provides a nice little discount!
1587	5	My dog is a rescue dog she was beaten almost to death before a kind person found her and took her to the shelter. A by product of that abuse was an injury in her knee that is the equivalent of a torn ACL in a human. Surgery saved her leg, but she favors it and is stiff due to arthritis in the knee joint. K9 glucosamine suggests 2tsp 2times a day for her weight, I started her on 3 tsp 2 times a day, wow! She does not limp or act like she is in pain at all! This result happened within 2 days of starting. I tried to cut down to the suggested dosage, then she limped a little. switched back to 3tsp 2 times a day and she is back to running around with no noticeable limp at all! This product is now a staple in our house, it is fantastic.
1588	5	This is wonderful with a little organic maple syrup and walnuts.  It is my new comfort food! Yummy!
1589	5	We recieved a gift basket for the holidays......I was sceptical about its contents..well i was blown away with its items.....they all were exceptionally good... Especially..... the sonoma jacks  garlic & herb cheese spread..........EXCELLENT!!!!!!
1590	5	I have used Spike to make beans and in soups, and it is delicious.  You hardly miss the salt at all.  Very flavorful!
1591	5	I loved this merguez sausage. It's a little spicy but doesn't burn your mouth off. A nice subtle spiciness. Very nice with Harissa hot sauce.
1592	5	Yummy, mild, and delicious. My new favorite! Mild in comparision to coffees called  rocket fuel  and taste like motor oil, but truly a medium roast. Pleasant in the morning. Makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee.
1593	5	This was a good deal because I live in Dallas and couldn't find them any where. Mrs Dash sell them at the local grocery store but they are too expensive.
1594	5	Get Naked Gut Health is an amazing product. Low cal, low fat, high moisture and high fiber ! A perfect combo weight control and digestion. Sodium content is a bit higher than I would like but with all other things considered it will do.<br />My 2 Papillons absolutely love these things ! They recognize the bag and come running and bouncing around as soon as I have it in my hand :) They are easy to please but they have never responded to anything like these things.<br />They smell good as they contain cinnamon,ginger and peppermint. I guess they like the smell and they taste good too.<br />I was mainly looking for a healthy dental chew. My vet recommend Get Naked but didn't say they came in so many different choices. Neither of my dogs have digestive problems but my little girls is 10 going on 11 and I thought this would be a good choice for her for weight control and to keep her digestive track healthy.<br />I have been using them for about 3 months and have already seen a difference. Some say they are higher but compared to the similar sticks in the supermarket<br />they really aren't that bad since they are twice as long much much healthier and one a day is sufficient for my dogs.<br />One thing I have found over the years, the more organic the food,treats,and chews the healthier the dog. I spend much more overall on my Paps<br />but they go to the vet for shots only. They never get sick. For a 10 + year old that is saying something and I contribute a lot of that to their diet !
1595	4	My little one was 14 months and below the 3rd percentile.  I nursed him and strictly limited my diet to accomodate his severe allergies to dairy, soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, corn etc.  The time came where I just couldn't handle the limited diet any longer (and cooking of 3 separate meals for he and I, a vegetarian husband, and three other kids all three times a day).  So I decided to wean.  My little guy couldn't have many of the rice milks which were devoid of protein and all the formulas (even the terrible poisonous Neocate) had something he couldn't have. Then I found Toddler Health--a God send!!!  The taste is honestly strange and pretty repulsive at times (he refuses it as a drink) but I'm able to get him to eat half a scoop of it in a bowl of oatmeal daily mixed in rice milk and homemade oat cakes as well.  Finally because of this formula, my little guy is slowly starting to catch up.  I bought the rice one and plan on getting the oat too in the near future.
1596	4	I like these products, a lot. Buying from Amazon saved $10 or so from the grocery store prices, plus they were delivered directly to my house instead.<br /><br />There's enough variety and quality here to keep you and your family interested in eating healthy rice, and they don't require too much work to make a truly delicious meal. I like it a lot.
1597	5	Mekong Flower Rice has become my favorite brown rice:  it's organic; it's whole grain; it cooks up fluffy and tender unlike other brown rice varieties I've tried over the years; and it's farmed using a System of Rice Intensification (which results in higher crop yields with less water, less seed, less land, and NO chemicals).  And it's now available at an even lower price through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program.  What's not to love?<br /><br />By the way, I use one cup of rice to one and three-quarters cups water and soak for 12-24 hours before cooking.  The rice cooks up in approximately 20 minutes when pre-soaked.  I started pre-soaking my rice several years ago when I realized that if soaking increases the digestability of beans, why wouldn't it do the same for grains?  Pre-soaking makes for plumper more tender rice.  Give it a try!
1598	1	I bought this sampler specifically because I already love the cranberry-apple flavor and thought I would like the others too.  Well, the package I received did not include the cranberry-apple (as listed in the product description) and it also did not include the tangerine flavor which I was looking forward to trying.  Instead it has blueberry and wild berry, both flavors that I'm not excited about.  I have tried a few of the flavors and they are pretty strong, fake fruit taste which is not what I was going for.  In the future I am going to stick to the cranberry-apple, which is delicious.
1599	5	These are so good and cute to look at too.  Not too sweet and they don't stick to your teeth like some candies do.  They used to carry them at one of the warehouse stores but haven't been spotted in a long time so I'm definitely going to order thru amazon!
1600	5	I purchased these to bag up and sell at a bake sale/fundraiser. Needless to say, I of course had to sample them. They were fantastic. Very fresh. They had berry flavor in the blue and red and kind of a marshmallow flavor in the white. They were a hit at the fundraiser. Thanks Albanese, you have great products!
1601	5	I was skeptical about purchasing the shirataki noodles after reading some of the reviews, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I made a lighter version of chicken alfredo and it is yummy. I have suffered no side effects thus far and my belly is full. Please have an open mind when trying these because the texture is not like regular pasta. The shirataki noodles sort of remind me of cooked squid... but in a good way. In conclusion, try them for yourself. The noodles are packaged in a fishy smelling liquid, but the smell goes away after rinsing.<br /><br />Go to your local grocer if you don't want to invest in bulk packaging online for your first purchase. That's what I did.
1602	5	No trans fat<br />No cholesterol<br />No preservatives<br />No GMO ingredients (Genetically Modified Organism)<br />No artificial colors<br />No artificial flavors<br /><br />You see these labels everywhere in grocery stores.  I tend to like this trend where new products are going.  We don't want toxic chemicals in our food.  Specially if you are in middle age like me, you tend to be more conscious about your health.<br /><br />The chips are tasty and not too salty.  Just the right flavoring for me.  Love the very subtle hint of garlic but I just don't quite notice the taste of olives. I don't buy the same chips every time I go to stores,  but this is good enough that I will certainly pick up a bag from time to time.
1603	5	I drink a lot of lipton tea and with the extra ten dollars off and free delivery this is definatly the best buy around.
1604	4	I've been using this Acai Powder for a couple of months for my smoothies and although I agree with several folks in here about the taste that its not quite pleasent, the aftertaste I got its quite good not to mention the nutritional features of the Acai, so I keep buying it.<br /><br />I have been using Amafruit Acai puree and I think the puree if far better than the freeze-dried powder and the taste is as good as the powder, so probably I will switch very soon of brand.<br /><br />Still a very good Acai Powder and nice price of Amazon Subscribe and Save.
1605	5	Great BBQ flavor with enough Habanero to give it a nice little kick.  The flavors are not overwhelming, so the taste of the almond still shines through.  A really nice snack that's just a little different.
1606	5	Love these italian ladyfingers. Where we live we can't get them so I am so glad to be able to find them
1607	5	Great product for organizing k-cups! My counter looks much tidier and I like having my favorite flavors right there with the machine. I have not had any significant issue with the drawer catching or being hard to open, and am pleased with the overall value.
1608	1	I bought this thinking it was a good deal, and I remember in my Keurig brewer's sampler pack that I like the french roast cups.  So, I ordered this  deal .  Do not buy this burnt, after-tasting, muddy coffee!!  Not worth the pennies saved.
1609	5	This food looks and smells DELICIOUS, even to mom's vegetarian nose! Frankly, most canned cat food makes mom heave and gag, especially when it's heated for a sickie, so she's actually looking forward to having to nuke some of this.<br /><br />She started with our picky eater, who, not coincidentally, hasn't been here very long and who's never eaten canned food since he's been here, no matter what flavor it was. It took him a minute, but he, too, enjoyed it. The rest of the herd came flying into the kitchen, even the deafie!! The baby with cerebral palsy got so excited she forgot to remove her toes and tail from the door of the feeding cage, did a flip, and almost took a header to the floor.<br /><br />THANKS Petite Cuisine!!<br />Love, the special critters
1610	5	Fit does a wonderful job of cleaning, removing pesticides and freshening up fruits and vegetables.  It's pricey, but I've tried all the competition and nothing I've found works as good. No after taste or residue at all.  Cleans an neutralizes chemicals and pesticides amazingly well.  A great product.
1611	3	I love the Jack Link products, but this a bit on the dry side and not much of a BBQ taste.
1612	5	I was introduced to medium roast 'C&C' (Coffee and Chicory) when<br />we went to breakfast at Stanley's in the French Quarter and I was<br />hooked.  (Most days I am choking down the last of my Maxwell House<br />so it doesn't go to waste but I'm counting the days til it's all gone.)<br />The medium roast C&C is much smoother than regular coffee and I<br />don't taste any bitterness at all.<br /><br />French Market's medium roast Restaurant Blend (white can) is awesome.<br />It says on the plastic lid to use 1/3 to 1/2 as much as regular coffee<br />(so a 1-pound can is the equivalent of a 2-pound can of coffee).  Based<br />on my experience, using only 1/3 wouldn't be enough - a 1/2 is better.<br /><br />One bit of advice I can give to those who add milk or cream to their<br />coffee - don't try adding milk or cream until the color matches what<br />you had with coffee or it'll be weakened too much.  The C&C will be<br />darker with the 'right' amount of milk or cream.<br /><br />As I write this Amazon's page says it's not available but I found it's<br />available directly from French Market [...]<br />for $7 a 1-pound can ($1 less if you order 12 cans or more).  I plan<br />on handing out cans as Christmas gifts.
1613	5	Not only does Coffee Bean Direct have a fantastic selection - it is about as fresh as you can get it. I have been a long time customer at their website, but by buying on Amazon the product is slightly less expensive AND shipping is free!<br /><br />I have tried several varieties and have settle on Papua New Guinea - but no matter what you favorite, you will not be disappointed
1614	5	My greyhound service dog loves these treats! I use them for training or reinforcing good behavior while out. They aren't too stinky, aren't too big, and are really healthy. An additional plus for service dogs is that these treats are soft, so there's no loud crunching sound when you use them in the library or in that quiet waiting room at the doctor's office. The small, round design means you'll fit a lot of these into a typical training pouch, so you won't run out. One note I would add is that, if you don't use them all on a particular outing, be sure to dump the unused treats back in the resealable bag or they may get hard. Other than that, these really are the perfect training/reinforcement treat for service dogs! Great stuff!
1615	5	I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .
1616	5	I love this Tahini! To me, Tahini is all about the same, but the price is super cheap for 4, 16-ounce jars! It's more that half of what I was paying in the local grocery store. I used to have to skimp because Tahini was so expense, but now I can use it how I like, without going broke. I've had the subscription for 3 months now and have been eating very well as a result!
1617	5	my wife makes gourmet food and she loves this chocolate.  best in the world and you can tell in the taste.
1618	5	These are really great. I got them to have a healthy nut snack, and they fit the bill. That they're organic is a great plus.
1619	5	I've been struggling with food intolerance lately, and by far the worst offender is sugar. Be that as it may, for some reason I don't have a problem with these cookies although they do contain sugar in the form of evaporated cane. They taste wonderful with just the right amount of spice and taste great dipped in coffee or milk if you can have that. I'd never know I was eating wheat-free gluten-free, or as my husband calls it, a  cookie-free cookie,  had I not read the package first. I like ginger snaps to begin with, and these taste great. They are a bit larger than a quarter, are crisp rather than soft, and have 130 calories per 4-cookie serving. No trans fats; 10g sugar.
1620	5	I've tried several flavors. The macadamia and apricot is the best with the apple cinnamon a close second<br />Very tasty
1621	5	This is a great oil that comes in a bottle that keeps it safe from light. I use this oil for all my frying needs and it has never let me down, even in these harsh economic times. An oil you can trust and, as time goes by, maybe even learn to call a friend. [wipes away the beginnings of a tear from eye]<br /><br />Peace and love to all.
1622	5	I recently returned from a vacation in Germany where I took a chance and purchased this whole-bean coffee from a supermarket chain in Munich.  Wow, I am sorry I did not purchase more bags; it's got a fantastic, smooth flavor, much like my favorite coffee from Vienna - Eduscho Melange.  Thankfully for the internet, I don't have to fly to Germany to buy more, although I'd do so in a heartbeat!
1623	4	This gourmet coffee has an exceptional strong taste with a hint of the exotic floral and berry flavor. The aroma itself enticed me. I have never tried yiragcheffe coffee before, but if it is anything like this one, I will certainly have it again.
1624	1	SO disappointed! I have oily, mild acne prone, sensitive, combo skin. This product DID NOT absorb into my skin AT ALL. It sat on top of my skin creating a 'slippery' greasy layer. Eww. After about 30 minutes, my skin was extremely oily, shiny & greasy looking. It looked and felt like baby oil on my face! I have oily skin but this product brought MORE excessive oil onto my face even in areas where I normally don't get oily. I don't understand how this is a oil-free moisturizer but yet makes your skin extremely oily. Glad I was able to return it!
1625	3	Though both my dogs love Purina Beggin' Strips, I am wary about feeding them too many due to the ingredients as well as the calories. There are 30 calories in one Beggin strip. The main ingredients in Beggin Strips  include ground wheat, corn gluten meal, wheat flour, ground yellow corn, sugar, glycerin, soybean meal,salt, and bacon fat preserved with carcinogenic BHA. Lots of corn meal and artificial preservatives sure isn't good nutrition for dogs and too many can lead to obesity and other health problems.
1626	5	Our cats absolutely love these treats and they are rather picky eaters. We've bought countless bags of cat treats only to toss most of them shortly after opening because our cats turn up their noses. I usually buy them locally but when our store ran out of stock and I couldn't find them anywhere else, I had to venture online. Kitty tested, kitty approved.
1627	5	Our Great Dane prefers Greenies over any other treat.  She really likes the small ones.  Because they are expensive we limit her to one  special Greenie  a week.  She knows when we get the box down and gets very excited.
1628	5	After trying all the coffees that came as samples with my Keurig machine,<br />Timothy's World Cofee, Midnight Magic proved to be the best of a very good group. I found it be as satisfying as any coffee I have had at Starbucks, The Coffee Bean Etc. Even at the weakest brew strength, It had great flavor. I highly recommend it!
1629	5	This is a good companion to a french press device.  I didn't find it too strong, which means coffee enthusiasts that prefer their coffee too strong, might not like it, but hey, if you think its a good idea, why not use two bags instead of one?  Marley coffee also claims to be organic, so if you are into organic stuff, this could be worth your while.
1630	4	My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect. I'm usually not much of a coffee drinker, I need it sweet or extremely smooth, so I was happy to find that this coffee was not as bitter as most. For those who need a nice, fresh easy coffee, I think this is perfect.<br /><br />It's important to note that these packets are for pod brewers, not your regular 8-10 cup coffee maker. They come conveniently packaged and my first thought upon opening them was that they're perfect for the small business! Hotels, bed & breakfasts, small offices, etc would all love this style of coffee that is convenient and individually made. I would definitely recommend it for someone in need of a good coffee for use at their small business. But also if you're a 1-cup a day sort of drinker, or someone who occasionally likes to make a very small pot of coffee--this is the perfect set up for you!
1631	1	I have several dogs in several sizes.  Nylabone products are always the ones that last.  When my pit bit off an arm of this toy I almost fell off the couch.  He bit off a Nylabone!  It wasn't until I found the toy outside a few days later and picked it up, realizing that it's not solid.  Makes me wonder what other toys are not solid from NB.  We still love the brand, but I would examine new toys carefully before buying them to see if I can tell if they are solid or not.
1632	4	Good quality coffee with  nice roast. Gave some for Christmas gifs and these received very favorable comments.
1633	5	First tasted this tea at my hairdressers, had to have it.Loved this product, delivered promptly, taste is absolutely delicious, will definitely be reordering this product.
1634	4	I like anchiovy a lot.<br /><br />My husband and inlaws are Spaniards who loves to eat anchiovy with bread , pizza and salad.<br /><br />And I like to make really good Ceasar salad but in order to make a great dressing you have to have the best ingredients.<br /><br />My number 1 prefernce for anchiovy are from Italy but I have to go to the Italian store in a different city to get it( and I have a back injury which stops me from driving around too much)  so I asked my friend from New Jersey to bring me anchiovy the New York pizza shop uses in Jersey.<br /><br />She brought 2. Cento amd Rolands. Both have a mild sweeter flavor and aroma and less salty . These are close to the ITalian anchiovy that I prefer.<br /><br />Rolands is not sold in smaller tins.You see once you open the anchiovy in the big tim , you have to put the rest  it in a glass container with lots of olive oil and  vacuum  it.Or else it will change in flavor and spoil faster.<br /><br />Well I  dont have a vacuum container so I chose Cento instead.It comes in small tin and Its from Morocco.<br /><br />I am glad Amazon sells it and I  love the subscription so I dont have to worry about running out.
1635	3	It says  all natural , but the sweetener is artificial splenda (don't mind though).<br /><br />Fruit punch is not my fav taste but it's actually not bad. I used 2 squeezes for 24 oz bottle and got just a little taste to have a break from water. It was already sweet to me.<br /><br />I wish they would provide info about caffeine, how much in 1 tablespoon or anything so I would know how much I drink (being pregnant). But I can only assume is not much, especially in 2 squeezes..<br /><br />Overall nothing I got crazy about. Good idea but maybe I'd like different taste better.
1636	1	$30 is way too much - this company is laughing all the way to the bank.  Wait til after Christmas - last year I paid $5 for both the Reeses AND the Hershey!!  Both worth the wait!!
1637	1	I bought a can of this for the novelty of seeing how my cat would react to a can of cat food that cost almost a buck fifty.  He's normally not a picky eater and routinely eats canned Friskies or 9-Lives.  I opened the can and placed the contents into a clean feeding bowl and presented it to him in his normal feeding place on the counter (up away from the dog).  He took a sniff and recoiled from it.  I then offered him a can of his regular food that he happily ate.  Well, that didn't go well.  So I then offered it to our Lab/Golden mix, a dog that loves nothing more than snapping up the cat's food if it is left within her reach.  One sniff and she jerked her head back from it and walked away.  Next step was to fling it out into the back yard where the grackles (an omnivorous bird common to South Texas) scavenge for moldy bread, pizza bones, stale chips and pretty much anything else we toss out.  Nope, the grackles wouldn't touch it either.  But the fire ants love it.  They are all over it and within a few days it will be gone.
1638	1	These were really gross gummy bears. I was hopeful because they have Vit C and my kids love gummy bears. But, after my kids' complaints, I tasted them too and they are just bad - a strange consistency and taste. Unfortunately, I can't return them because we had already opened the box to try them. Don't waste your money.
1639	5	Once I started using this coffee I realized that the coffee maker is not what makes good coffee, it is the quality and flavor of the coffee you are using.  I tried many different types of coffee and this is one of my favorites for espresso and cappuccinos.  Highly recommend this.  I have a 12 year old Krups cappuccino maker that makes the perfect cappuccino in the morning with this coffee.  Most other coffee grounds fell short.
1640	3	I love these cookies, the first time I had then was on a plane.  They are addictive do I was glad to find them on line.  But I had to buy a lot of packages at once and many of the packages contain mostly broken cookies.
1641	5	Giving my dog pills was a nightmare until my vet game me some of these to try. They smell good and my dog loves to take her pills tucked inside a greenie pill pocket. Problem solved : )
1642	5	This is the only health bar, that is the KIND BAR that can compete with such treats as M&M Peanuts, MARS Bars, Baby Ruth etc.,this one dark chocolate with peanuts is my very favorite..I put them in the freezer and they then make a great summer treat!!!
1643	5	I had no reason to buy a gluten-free bar, but the reviews won me over. These are incredible! They taste great -- chocolatey with hints of coconut -- and they actually stave off my hunger for more than twenty minutes, which no snack bar has ever done. Even shortly after eating something like a clif bar I'm ready to gnaw someone's arm off. I'll eat one of these before I go for a long run; it doesn't weigh me down, but I have something in me so I don't feel nauseous afterward. I bought these on sale, but I think I'm going to take the plunge and buy them at the non-sale price. That in itself is an amazing review coming from me.
1644	1	Not good. Not a creamy texture, it tastes more like fat than chocolate, i would not recommend this truffle.Their texture is definitely gritty and not pleasant at all.
1645	5	I was thrilled when Chex cereals came out with gluten-free cereals. They are tasty and help you think you are eating  regular  food. A real plus for someone with celiac disease.
1646	5	This drawer sits nicely under my Keurig coffer maker.  It's ecstatically pleasing.  It's holds lots of pods.  It's nice and sturdy.  Everything as advertised.  I will probably buy another one for my other Keurig in my office.
1647	5	can't tell the difference between this and taffy with sugar (I kept doubting whether it was really sugar free!)<br /><br />doesn't cause the same amount of bloating, etc as some other sugar-free candies...<br /><br />excellent taste, feel, etc!
1648	5	I had looked for weeks for Sumac.  Because I trust Amazon, I ordered from Amazon.  The spice was fresh, sealed in a plastic bag, and quantity-wise was more than I had needed.  The delivery was rapid - totally satisfied.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a spice that's fresh and delivered quickly.
1649	5	Like the Rosebud Powder found here: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VWES4 >Rosebud - Powder - 1.3 OZ</a> , I purchased this for incorporation into homemade Ras El Hanout.  Since the floral component of this Multi-Spice is quite small (floral powders easily overwhelming other flavours if overused), I ended up with quite a bit left over for use in my perfume-making hobby or in sachets, etc.<br /><br />I found this to be a high-grade powdered lavender, the floral 'nose' being greater than the (wholly expected and natural) bitterness of it.
1650	3	Like other reviewers have pointed out, these are not sparkles. They just add a little shimmer. The flakes are large, not glittery. No taste or crunch either. They just kind of fall on icing and look like really thin shards of glass. Not pretty, just shiny purple. My mother-in-law thought it was plastic that fell on the cupcake and was picking it off until I told her what it was. Not very impressive!
1651	1	I paid double for two-day shipment to get these by National Toasted Marshmallow day (Aug. 30), only to receive pourable topping rather than shareable jelly beans.  Even on the dedicated shipment box it reads  jelly beans , but nowhere on the product site does it indicate these are not actually beans, but goopy topping. Very disappointed.
1652	1	I did not find this movie at all entertaining. I am not a huge fan of Tim Burton but I though it might make a cute Halloween movie. Didn't do it for me. It also says the  F  word and that is not a word I care to listen to or allow my children to listen to in my home.  It seems that things that I found fun and entertaining in my youth are no longer fun and entertaining to me. If you are looking for a fun movie to watch as a family I would not suggest this one.
1653	5	I can't say enough about the Melitta line of coffees!  They are by far the best coffee I've ever made at home.  I typically by the  Buzzworthy  and fill my  to go  coffee cup twice (using my Melitta Coffee maker, one large cup and one small cup buttons).  It's perfectly diluted, but still strong.  My mom prefers this brand,  Love At First Sip .  It's a milder blend, but still VERY good, even when pressing the small cup button twice.<br /><br />These coffee blends taste like the gourmet coffee you buy in the trendy coffee houses.  You will LOVE these coffees!
1654	5	 In Sicily, we say that planting olive trees is for long-term thinkers. In fact, this is exactly the distinctive character of the Taibi family. It is manifested in the care and attention to details that we put in every step of the making of Olio Taibi. I have vivid childhood memories of my grandfather Giuseppe emerging from the cellar after filling a terra-cotta jar with the green oil made by hand at the family's olive orchard, then drizzling it on fresh-made ricotta cheese generously spread on a slice of warm, homemade bread.  <br /><br />-Giuseppe Taibi, 4th generation olive oil producer
1655	5	I have shopped at local Whole food retailers and have been paying a very high price for it.  I justified that it was specialty shopping and if I was going to eat right, it was going to cost.  I had no idea Amazon had a line of health products.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I ordered Xylotol and saved over 50% off the local retail price, plus it was shipped for a very reasonable fee (.99) right to my door.  I am extremely pleased with this new way of shopping and have been referring your sight to all my friend.  Thanks!
1656	1	Google  propylene glycol  to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's  pure  and then there's  not so much .....<br /><br />from the website:  [...]<br /><br />Propylene Glycol<br /><br />A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.<br />Also used in:<br /><br />  Tyre sealant<br />  Rubber cleaner<br />  De-icer<br />  Stain removers<br />  Fabric softener<br />  Degreaser<br />  Paint<br />  Adhesive<br />  Wallpaper stripper<br /><br />I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded....
1657	5	I was introduced to this great product by a vet when our previous dog was 12. He lived to 16 and I truly believe that this product extended his life by a few months or more. We now give it to our new little guy and he loves it. It is great for their joints and coat as well as their general health. Great product!!
1658	5	I have lived in the US for 5 years ad have not found a decent marmalade yet!  they have so much thick peel but Robertsons Golden Shred and Golden Shredless are so good,  I advise all Americans to try it, they will love it!
1659	5	I love English Toffee coffee, but could no longer find it in my local grocery store.  This one is great!
1660	1	Read the packages carefully before buying.  Cadet is known for  irradiating  their products.  That is not  all natural.   Our holistic vet advises to never feed irradiated or  high-pressure pasturised  products to animals.  It's not worth the risk and it definitely puts more toxic junk into their systems.<br /><br />Merrick is not great either.  They own their own rendering plant in TX.  Road kill; euthanized pets; diseased, dead, dying, and downed animals are allowed and included in rendered meats and by-products.
1661	5	I've been drinking this tea for over 8 months now.  I found it way too strong at first, and nearly gave up.  So, I now use half as much, and it's still strong enough, and I let it steep for a full 5 minutes.  I've come to just love it now, and I drink it more than I ever did plain black tea.  So, those of you who think it's too strong, try it at half the amount.  Not only better, but lasts twice as long!!!
1662	5	As a recent weight loss surgery patient, I found that my tastes had changed significantly after surgery and I could not use any of the protein supplements suggested by my doctors. I tried a dozen alternatives and found that I could not use any of them and this is a very bad thing for WLS patients. I then tried Click as recommended by the good folks at BTV ([...]) and I was hooked. It tastes great, like a mocha from Starbucks but with only 120 calories per serving. I got 15 grams of protein. I got a buttload of vitamins and minerals as a bonus and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The energy boost works well since I substitute a Click for breakfast. A kick in the pants to get me going, 120 calories and enough protein that I don't get hungry. What's not to love?
1663	5	Got the 30lb bag on Amazon at $9 less than the local petstore. How excellent is that??? - Better price and good to have it delivered to my door!  My pup has been eating this premium dog food for years....it's got all the good stuff and none of the bad!
1664	1	I ordered this knowing it would not be what the picture shows, so I blame myself, but do not order this if you think it will be like the picture shows it is not. The cheese is shorter and the sausage the same. Not the size it shows. Not at all.
1665	5	This is the best gluten-free pasta product available.  Tastes great while maintaining a good texture. Serve it to my entire family and guests.
1666	5	one of the best tea i've ever tasted so far! I had a hard time finding brown rice tea in any supemarket in NH, so i looked @ amazon and got one! If i ran out of tea, i will order more at Yamamotoyama :)
1667	5	So far, this is one of only 3 dog food brands that I've found that my Border collie and adopted Australian Shepherd do well on. They used to itch and shed a lot until I switched to this food. Our australian shepherd had pink around his mouth and on his belly before switching. It has limited ingredients, less chance of food alergies. I have tried many high cost and probably high quality foods but nothing worked. I ended up having the best luck with this and with Purina one smartblend of all foods. I know, I know, that's not what you read when you research the internet but my dogs do best on Purina or this California brand.
1668	1	I emailed the company several times they never emailed back i left about 5 voicemails because they never picked up the phone they left me very unsatisfied The Online Candy Shop ships damaged goods it came on October 8th 2010 so it wasn't hot outside so why was every candy melted and the ones i sampled tasted disgusting i recommend ordering this product from a different store.
1669	1	this was so not worth the buy. I think they had a horrible after taste and just didn't like them at all.
1670	5	You gotta love good ol' Coca-Cola! Too bad my family is like,  OMG!!! COCA-COLa is teh sux0rs!! peps! roxs!!  Actually, I'm pretty tired of these reviewers constantly comparing. I think both taste great, even though Pepsi is SLIGHTLY sweeter.<br /><br /> Coca-Cola comes in many flavors: Regular, Diet, [which is horrible; kind of like brown water.] Cherry, [I love Cherry Coke! It has a hint of cherry flavor!] C2, [Half the calories, carbs, sugar, but it tastes like the original.] Vanilla, [It has a hint of vanilla. Tastes great!] and Lime. [Who could forget the phrase,  Put the Lime in the Coke, you nut. ?]<br /><br /> Oh, and another thing: Coca-Cola used to contain cocaine in the early days. Not anymore, though.
1671	5	I've tried several brands and flavors of treats for my cat, but this is the only one she really likes. Finding the dairy flavor after we moved was difficult, and ordering from Amazon is easy and keeps a supply on hand.
1672	5	This is THE mmmost delicious Kind bar there is! Its like eating a candy bar, except its good for you.
1673	5	I was tired of paying $4 - $5 for each chait tea drink at the coffee shop but it was an adventure to find an at home product that tasted as good as the coffee shop.  THIS IS IT!  It is really delicious you won't be disappointed.  :)
1674	5	I drink coconut water because it is so delicious. But since most of the canned/packaged stuff is so expensive, I tried this product. IT IS GOOD! I like this even more than the original, which tastes exactly like regular coconut water. The pineapple is a good addition, not too strong, just right. I mix it 2 spoonfuls into 16oz of cold water, stir vigorously for about 20 seconds. DRINK. ENJOY.
1675	5	Great taste, quality of the blends was perfect. I stuffed a fish with rhis rice, turned out to become a favorite now.<br />Thanks to Amazon and Lundberg.
1676	4	Okay, here is the best way to cook this stuff.  Get some Nutritional Yeast or Brewer's Yeast.  Coat the Fri-Chik in the yeast and fry.  Mmmmmm  Mmmmmmmm  Good!
1677	5	Tastes great and is super easy to make.  It's not as good as brewed coffee, but for being instant, it's perfect.  Love taking this when we travel, so we don't have to use the low-quality coffee that often comes in the hotel room.  In the summer, I also like making iced coffee with this, no need to buy the special iced coffee mix.  I just barely heat the water, mix and add a little cream and some ice cubes.  Works well since I don't use sugar, so can't use the special iced coffee mix.  Recommended.
1678	5	Love these tea biscuits. The price was great for a box of 12. I hope you continue to carry.
1679	4	The Cinnamon Oat Clusters are so addictive and a perfect snack to grab when you're in a rush. It tasted a little like a good cinnamon flavored oatmeal. All the flavors complimented each other perfectly - none overwhelming the other. My only complaint would be that I wish the clusters held together better. I had very few clusters left when my bag arrived.<br />It was great with yogurt and I would love to try it with a little milk as the bag suggest.
1680	5	Red rose is the only black tea worthy to drink and I have been drinking it for almost 50 years since my French grandma got me on it. My kids are also hooked now and I told my daughter that when I am on my deathbed all I want is a cup of RedRose with milk and sugar. Truly--it is clean, strong, with a complex flavor. I guess you can tell I highly recommend it.
1681	4	I can't speak for other owners, but my four cats really love this food.  The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because you need to use their call of the wild supplement if you use this wet food as your cats only food.  Overall this is a great balanced food that is closer to a cats natural diet than most over processed canned and dried food.  Its one of the few commercial canned foods out there that does not have by products or grain.  My cats really enjoy the taste of the supplement too.
1682	5	Okay, I know this is probably like a little kids/baby product, but I can't help it-- I'm hooked on these things. I'm a graduate student in college, and I buy these by the case to have as breakfast-on-the-go while driving to school, or snacks in the evening. Of course, they're so small I have to eat like three at a time to be satisfied-- this is why buying by the case is great-- but it ends up being really expensive because they're so small. So yeah, if they go on sale, buy lots of them. They're great.
1683	5	Very good.  I wasn't able to find anywhere else and it worked perfectly with my daughter's 1st birthday pink monkey themed party.  It's worth the price.
1684	4	This is not bad, it's good on a salad, and decent as a veggie dip as well.  It's very tangy, and nice in it's own way but does not taste like a normal full fat ranch dressing.  It's on par with other low fat or light dressings I have tried, but with 0 calories.  I like to add a little cracked black pepper to mine.  I may buy this again, but I prefer their Caesar dressing.
1685	3	My dog managed to chew threw the rubber tug in less than 30 seconds.  That being said, I can't say that the toy is a total loss.  I turned the leftover part upside down in the jug and it is fairly effective at slowing down the dispensation of the food treats that are inside.  Keeps mine amused for as long as the food is in there
1686	5	I tried an other brand of agave but found that Wholesome Sweeteners has a milder taste.  It's really good.  It's great in tea and coffee.  I also use it to sweeten oatmeal. I even transfer it to a smaller size that I carry in my purse. It's so much better than artificial sweeteners. I have not cooked with it; however, I plan to in the future.
1687	4	I saw these FiberPlus Bars in my Amazon Golden Box and went on a limb in buying a pack of 12. I've been eating FiberOne bars for the past 3 years - 1-2 peanut butter FiberOne bars a day. The Kellogg's FiberPlus bars are less dense. The flavor is good and seems a little bit  easier  on the system.
1688	5	Best coffee out there for the price.  A little pricey if compared with a 2# can of ground coffee, but no comparison with the flavor.  This coffee tastes like  good  restaurant coffee.  I purchased the filter for my senseo that allows me to use regular coffee, but the taste difference is so extreme that I always use the pods.
1689	5	I recieved one of these bars in my Influenster voxbox and I love it! I warmed it up in the microwave for a few seconds and when I took it out the smell of it was amazing,a little on the nutty side and it was super soft. Went well with my morning coffee. It is a little on the sweet size but the bar itself is rather small. I do plan on purchasing a box of these in the future.
1690	5	I needed this product for my homemade wheat bread recipe.  It made a huge difference in the texture as I use only wheat flour.  The product arrived in 2 days.  Good buy!
1691	5	I just ordered my second purchase of this item.<br /><br />I saw other people's reviews and I was surprised.<br />I have been using Nutrasweet for years. It has the same ingredients as Equal but half the price.<br />I have a packet from my previous purchase of Sweet Mate. It says in ingredients: Dextrose with maldextrin, aspartame (aspartame is the main sweetener ingredient). That is the same ingredients as Equal.<br /><br />It is half the price that I pay for Nutrasweet in store, and a whole lot less than Equal.
1692	5	These add the taste of bacon to just about everything you can add them too. I don't find them over salty when used sparingly. All four of them in the sampler said  low sodium  on the front label. I guess if you add a lot to whatever you are using it on it would taste oversalted. I like it tossed into potato salad or on a fake club sandwich of turkey, tomato, lettuce and their Baconaise.
1693	3	Well, I read the reviews about the company not putting what was expected into the box's however I figured it was just a fluke.  It may be, however I guess I am a fluke as well.<br />I received the breakfast, medium roast and dark roast.  I did not get any decaf.  I especially wanted to see what the decaf tasted like because many of them have a very weak taste.<br /><br />They have a subscription service, however if I cant trust them to pack what I ask for in a variety pack I am surly not going to subscribe to their service.  I am into customer service and sweating the small things.<br /><br />I am giving the coffee 3 stars simply because the coffee is pretty good.  If it wasn't, in my opinion they would only rank 1 star.<br /><br />Too bad.
1694	5	this is great stuff.  when it comes on the market i will buy it.  the pomegranate flavoring is surpurb.  funny thing it doesn't leave a after taste like regular licorice does.  the taste is smooth and enjoyable.  it does not harden up even after being left open for a week like regular licorice does.
1695	5	5 star rated by a number of independent experts.  arrives as detailed every time.<br />my best friend/soulmate loves this kibble as his food AND as a treat.  he is a Weimeraner and his muscles have bulked up, his weight and definition have become awesome, his poop is as good as poop gets, his fur is much softer and smoother, his energy and playtime has become off the chain great.<br />no single food is best for every one of our family members.  I would guess that if you are already using a 4 or 5 star rated kibble and your soulmate is happy and healthy, there is prolly no need to change up.  there are many really good foods available!!  congrats to you in providing a healthy diet!!<br />however, if you have been duped into buying the crap foods that receive less than 4 stars (you will be amazed at how many HUGE names are rated a 1 star garbage - I will refrain from naming a couple of dozen sold everywhere including most sold by vets), I beg you to sample this awesome product!!  I have found this kibble to be merely twice as expensive as the cheapest garbage one can buy at the local Dollar General store.  the long-lasting benefits to my soulmate are worth at least 10 times that...<br />a massively recommended product from Amazon...
1696	5	I have been buying Kind Bars for over a year and must say each and every bar is wonderful. I use them as a snack or a breakfast and find it keeps me satisfied completely.  The Almond Walnut Macadamia bars are perfectly delicious with whole nuts in every bite...heaven on earth!
1697	5	Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q >Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.
1698	5	These are delicious... and I don't mean they're delicious for being relatively healthy. Even without the healthy aspect, they are great. I'm not a fan of the cripy bars... but these I could eat alllll day long.
1699	4	The watermelon/strawberry flavor of this drink was pleasant.  The size of the drink was reasonable.  I would have given the product five stars, but the drink was just a little sweet.  I recommend giving it a try to see what you think.
1700	5	After sampling about every K-Cup out there, I have to say the Caribou blend is the best one for daily, regular coffee drinkers. I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees, nor do I love the dark, bitter, bold types. I simply want a smooth cup of Joe I can drink daily and feel comforted it will be consistently the same tasting and awesome. Caribou's are the perfect fit for me. I would go as far as to say that brewing Caribou in K-Cups at home has kept me from going to Starbucks for over a month...it just tastes better!
1701	4	I used these recently to make some white raspberry chocolate molded cars. They arrived in perfect condition and I was surprised to see how very pristine white they were. They melted beautifully, smooth and glossy. I added some raspberry candy flavoring oil and my little cars turned out great. However, to my palate, they are a bit too sweet. Other than that, they are great candy coatings.
1702	5	If you like the taste of Bergamot the Stash's Premium Double Bergamot is smooth and delightful tasting. My first order occurred as a mistake as I meant to order Stash's Earl Grey and didn't note the Double Bergamot listing.  I find that I prefer the Earl Grey Double Bergamot taste as do several other members of our friends.
1703	1	i was disapointed since this product is not like the original. the chocolate is darker and not creamy like the original.
1704	5	Never heard of it. Did some research and decided to try it. Extremely satisfied with my choice! I went for the  Light  version since my research mentioned that it was the one with no strong after-taste. Much better, natural choice than artificial sweeteners. Does have calories, but the glycemic index response is very good; translation: it doesn't give you that  sugar rush . I like things fairly sweet, so I use 2-3 teaspoons per cup of coffee. You may need less. DEFINITELY get the 12 pack!!! Best value and you'll be amazed at how much you start using it!
1705	5	I loved the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie that i recieved complements of Influenster.com. The cookie was soft and chewy with a sweet cinnamon kick to it! I couldnt wait to buy more!
1706	5	I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception. The taste is mild and it works like a charm to ease menstrual cramps. A must have during your moon cycle. Good value for the price.<br /><br />Also check out <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLQ >Yogi Woman's Moon Cycle, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>
1707	5	Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is the best. I use it instead of duck sauce. Check it out. Once you try it, you'll be hooked.
1708	5	It really is a shame that the Tastykake Brand has only established itself in the Northeastern portion of the U.S.A., being that the rest of the world is missing out on the finest pre-packaged snack pastry on the face of this earth.  For those who are unfortunate enough not to know what a Tastykake is, it's like a Little Debbie or a Hostess, which is centered out of the Philadelphia area.  And should you happen to run into anybody from the Philadelphia area and ask them about this line of products, they will inevitably tell you that once you've experienced the snack God that is the Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpet, those Drake's Coffee Cakes and Hostess Twinkies will no longer have any appeal.<br /><br /> It's hard to put into words just how fantastic these spongey, moist, and vanilla butterscotch frosted guys are.  Seriously, the Butterscotch Krimpet can even beat out many fresh baked bakery products, despite being mass manufactured and factory sealed in boxes.  I seriously suggest grabbing a big jug of chocolate milk and ordering a box of these on Amazon right now, especially if you're not from the Mid-Atlantic region and are under the false assumption that Hostess is a quality product.  If so, you will be blown away by the krimpet's culinary goodness.<br /><br /> Tastykake's seemingly pompous slogan goes,  Nobody bakes a cake as tasty as a Tastykake.   Once you experience the Butterscotch Krimpet, you'll realize that they have more than substantial reason to gloat.
1709	2	Unhappy with taste.  Not as peach tasting as I would have liked.  Disappointed.  Gave it away.
1710	5	Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast.
1711	5	I was brought up eating Rusk and it's still something I crave.  Very low on calories even though I admit I spread a tiny bit of butter on.  The service was faster than I expected and I'm ordering more right now.
1712	5	love it on fish. Couldn't find it anymore at stores in my area.Now I have enough for a life time.
1713	5	This is the best tasting cappuccino, ever! Just like the yummy gas station stuff that I love. I always look forward to drinking this every day=)
1714	1	This was gross. It tasted funny and also would not mix up with the hot water or hot milk. the powder would just stay in chunks, floating on the top. I tried this a couple times, then donated the rest to a food bank. Wont be ordering this again!
1715	1	First of all, this noodle is NOT spicy at all. Even after adding the entire pack of the spice into the bowl, I didn't feel the  spicy  sensation in my mouth.<br /><br />BUT... that is not the reason why I am giving this product a 1-star rating. The reason is that the product is actually quite salty. Of course one can always adjust the amount of spice that he/she adds into the bowl but the name of this product is  Spicy Chicken  , not  Salty Chicken .<br /><br />Aside from it not being spicy but quite salty, there is also quite a bit of curry flavor in it. I am a big fan of curry...but I like the  real  freshly made curry that requires at least one whole day of prep time. The artificial curry flavor, plus the saltiness, PLUS it not being spicy, prompts me to give this product a low rating.<br /><br />Come to think of it, actually, there are also 2 other reasons behind my 1-star rating aside from the taste. (1) Amazon doesn't have a rating system that goes below 1-star... and (2) If/when I am about to starve to death with less than 10 cents left in my bank accounts and this is the only food available in my house ( NOT even any dog or cat food left), would I go for this noodle? Heck Yeah...
1716	5	This is our favorite flavor of all of the Keurig choices. Just enough kick but still relatively mild.  Great price too!
1717	5	This is now my favorite.<br />I drink coffee black and the taste of Donut House is excellent.
1718	5	Super great catnip. The quality is great, and amazingly fresh. The ten keeps it that way.<br />Every time I open it, my cat goes crazy.<br /><br />(FWI: Remember, never give a kitten catnip. When they become adults it has less of an effect on them, or no effect at all depending on the cat.)
1719	1	Not worth the money for the  health benefits , even if it wasn't disgusting I wouldn't but it! I recommend you spend your money elsewhere.
1720	5	My wife and I have been using unsweetened iced tea for years.  It's great if you're watching your sugar, however it is rather difficult to find an instant iced tea that is absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives.  We sometimes add stevia powder to sweeten it up and it tastes absolutely delicious.  This tea mix specifically is now our favorite.  We've tries many brands, which many of them we also like, but this is the best we have found. The taste is good, it dissolves easily, and it is pure.
1721	2	I've been adding Tulsi Tea to my diet.  I love the peppermint flavor and drink it daily along with my other great teas.<br /><br />I didn't really care for the flavor of this honey chamomile tea.  I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.
1722	5	My shelties LOVED these treats. They were really tasty. The variety was nice. They never knew what was coming.
1723	5	I love sweet tea but gave it up because of the sugar content & I don't like the aftertaste of other sweeteners.  Ideal has no aftertaste & sweetens just like sugar.  I use it in my drinks and in cooking.  5 stars definitely.
1724	4	Just got through making a huge batch of muffins (I made them a little smaller than called for).  What a wonderful treat and they definitely did not taste low carb!  I think next time I might play with some extra spices or maybe add just a few nuts--I have lots of ideas for this great mix.
1725	5	I usually hate the taste of prepackaged cookies but these were amazingly yummy. I got the chocolate lovers cookies and they were LOADED with chocolate chips and chunks. In my opinion these easily rivaled store bought unbaked cookie dough cookies once they've been baked and cooled when it came to taste and texture. I loved them and will be buying them on a regular basis.<br /><br />The Keebler elves really got their act together with these cookies. These are WAY better than Chips Ahoy by a long shot.
1726	5	I got this product damaged, amazon was great about replacing it. What was undamaged was mostly coffee, I wish there was more then just that. I am happy of the great selection just wish there was more tea/coco.
1727	5	My husband and I bake a lot and everyone perfers the taste of the items when we use this type of vanilla. It gives a fantastic taste and smell.  The company shipped the items quickly.
1728	5	One thing for certain, you really can not go wrong when choosing Maxwell House. For years their products have been top quality in taste and always at a reasonable price. But the Peppermint Mocha Latte is by far their best creation, especially during the Holidays. It has such a rich flavor! Our main concern was that the peppermint would overpower the taste but I have to say it was perfectly blended. To us it's the best way to wind down a day; sit by the fireplace sipping a peppermint mocha latte and just relaxing. Very highly recommended!
1729	5	Food mixes well, ingrediants are healthy, dog loves the taste.  What more could you ask for!
1730	3	These may not be the best tasting breakfast bars ever, but if you're on the go all day and can't always stop to eat, they are a life savor.  There are very few filling GF foods that you can carry in your purse that won't melt or fall apart on you, and these hold up great.  I also like the apple flavor.
1731	5	If you like a balanced cup of joe, this is a great choice. The coffee is smooth and balanced. There is no bitterness or bite. Thank you Chef Puck for this fantastic decaf coffee choice!
1732	4	We've been feeding these to our dogs for about a month now and one thing is clear, they love them! We give them as recommended on the package, twice per day for each dog. We tried giving them glucosamine/chondriotin in a different type of treat but one of the dogs wouldn't eat it. Not so for these.<br /><br />I recommend getting subscribed on a monthly basis if you want to save money.<br /><br />Big Red
1733	5	The flavor is excellent. I myself do not detect an artificial sweetener taste that bothers me. When I make my own Pomegranate concoctions from Frozen Pomegranate Puree I can't get it better than this. I think this is a very painless way to get some Vitamins and drink more water.
1734	5	I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it.
1735	5	I have my aunt ship this at Christmas time.  It is great on its own or as a creamy butter spread with cinnamon.  I certainly hope that Amazon gets it stocked quickly.  My whole family loves this stuff!
1736	5	i havent baught it online but i have used this tea and it is amazing. it tastes really good with honey or no honey
1737	4	I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this product, but once you get used to the idea of mixing up your own peanut butter, it's really quite good. I have tried both the plain and the peanut/chocolate version, and I prefer the one with the chocolate for eating on rice cakes and such. However, I have been adding the plain to my chocolate protein shakes, and that works really well too. It's like drinking a candy bar. If I eat the plain one as peanut butter, I usually add some Truvia or honey, because it just doesn't seem sweet enough on it's own. If you order the peanut/chocolate version, I highly recommend sizing up, because it goes rather quickly, and you will wish you had more. You will also save on shipping.
1738	3	There a few things I liked about this product. Being an iced-coffee lover, I really appreciated the ease of having a can ready to go in the fridge and the serving size was just right. It also had a decent coffee flavor. But it was really just too sweet for my taste.
1739	4	I bought this to help me fall asleep and it works although it tastes and smell really bad. Make sure to put this in some sort of a glass jar to prevent your kitchen from stinking. I found that if i added cream to this tea it would help the taste but its still pretty bad.
1740	1	It tastes like I licked a mop used on the floor of a Greyhound bus station!
1741	5	When I first became gluten free I tried to mix different flours (rice, tapioca, sorghum, etc) but cakes were always dense.  This is a close as you can get to real flour.  Still need xanthum gum.  cakes a light.  also their pizza mix is great.  we cook the crust a little to make it crispy and then at the sauce, cheese, and toppings.
1742	1	This arrived in a huge box with very little filler. The bottles were broken and the box had leaked out. What's worse is that grocery items cannot be returned, so I'm not sure I can get my money back. I'll have to make a phone, but wanted to post a review first. Don't buy this.
1743	1	All my children are vegetarian, and have been there entire life. I thought these snacks would be a good choice. It is hard to find varieties of foods for kids that don't have junk in them. I gave mymiddle daughter these as a snack for school. When she got home I asked why she had not eaten them. She said  I don't like them mommy.   I then tried them and was like yuck. I felt bad that my kids tried them. I then made it a joke letting others try them and seeing their reactions. So far NO ONE has liked them.
1744	5	Easy cleanup! Grounds are much more messy. These pods are quicker to use and quicker cleanup. I buy by the box and keep them in the freezer.
1745	5	tastes great - very convenient to take on the go.  Strawberry tastes the best of the flavors. I wish it came in larger quantities.
1746	5	I love these whenever bars. My favorite flavor is the cranberry ones. But these make a nice change. The blueberry is complemented by the lemon, and the lemon is very mild. I order these on subscription and that makes the price much more reasonable than buying these locally, i.e. Central Market or Whole Foods.
1747	5	So, that is $5.18 per bottle.  The Chipolte gives this a wonderful flavor that is very helpful when trying to diet.
1748	2	The products are delicious, however, the size of the basket is disappointing for the price.  The products are comparable to  snack sizes, so don't be mislead.
1749	5	It took almost a year, but after trying many different kinds of Kcup brands, my husband has finally found one strong enough for his tastes. For those of you who like strong coffee and have had a hard time getting it right with your Keurig, try this.
1750	5	I normally really dislike mint tea.  Usually it has a lot of peppermint and is too strong.  But this one is milder and has spearmint, predominantly.  Not strong, though, and very, very smooth.<br /><br />A bit of honey or sweetener is nice with this one.<br /><br />I don't get distinct tastes of other things that they put in the tea -- the flavor is more of a gestalt.  It is a mint flavor that is more complex than the typical strong plain mint tea.<br /><br />Very, very nice.
1751	2	I enjoy many types of tea, the more flavorful the better. I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good. It has a very oily taste to it. I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again.
1752	4	The mojito is one of The Wiofe's favorite drinks and the kids got a kick out of the Appletini moctail, so we gave this one a shot too.  I think there's a noticeable medicine taste, as with most sugar-free drinks, but they love them.
1753	5	My 8 yr old Siamese, Random, has always had stomach issues. He has trouble with hairballs and he tends to eat too quickly, which results in the food coming right back out. He's been on prednisolone since he was young to control his vomitting.  Since I switched him to Royal Canin Special 33, I've been able to reduce the dosage of the prednisolone and he vomits less often!  He doesn't vomit right after eating anymore either.  He's perkier than he has been in years and he looks fantastic.  His coat is good, his eyes are bright.  Our other cat Nimitz, a 2 yr old Norwegian Forest cat, shares this food and he looks fantastic too.  It's not the cheapest food I've ever bought, but it's worth every penny to me!
1754	5	I have loved Jacobs coffee since visiting Germany in the 70s.  I always asked the service people I knew to get it from the commissary or the PX when they went.  They have trouble keeping it in stock.  With free Super Saving shipping, it is cheaper than buying good coffee at the store.<br /><br />This is a medium roast coffee with a rather low acid content. Just wonderful!
1755	5	Good Earth Original Caffeine Free Tea (also available with caffeine) is my favorite tea!  I drink it all day long! I'm always looking for a good price on it and recently discovered that buying it through Amazon is the least expensive way to buy it.  I was also pleased with how quickly it was sent to me.
1756	5	This is a solid product.  They are strong and roomy. I have plenty of room inside the gloves for circulation. I have been using them for a few months and have not experienced the doom of a leak.<br /><br />The greatest aspect of this product is that it provides a direct income for the individuals that make the gloves.<br /><br />Made in Sri Lanka
1757	5	I love these chips.  Wonderfully pristine and interesting ingredients.  1-ounce bag, which is perfect to take to work as an emergency snack if there's no time for a lunch break, has 140 calories, 3 grams of fiber, zero trans fats, 7 grams of total fat (a little high but the truth is sometimes higher fat content equals more filling) and a nice and low 2 grams of sugar and equally nice and low 80 mg of sodium.  I will save the bags and recycle with http://www.terracycle.net/ with my energy bar wrappers.  I rarely eat chips because of weight considerations.  These are definitely worth the calories.  But they could be addictive so I've gotta watch it.  Bottom line:  absolutely delicious and crunchy.
1758	5	I hate making black icing at home, there's always an after taste from the food coloring and it ends up being a big mess. The Wilton tubes of black icing are great for frozen buttercream transfers when I decorate a birthday cake and much easier to handle.
1759	4	With 2 toddlers at home these are great healthy snacks for breakfast or on-the-go.  Each pouch is the perfect size for 1 snack.  We love the apple kind - a big box retailer around us started selling these with other varieties (like strawberry-banana) that wasn't as popular in our house so I love that we can get just apple from Amazon.  We also like the Asian pear so we may alternate orders.<br /><br />I only gave 4 stars because a real apple would also have water in it (which is the whole point of the Brother's All Natural process) but this is much more portable and less messy for small kids.
1760	5	Much more nutritious than my usual//Mickey D sausage biscuit!!/very clean, filling snack..My stomach does much better when I have my granola//hooked on it//saw the birth of this product on the Food Channel several years ago!!  I work for a health care agency and now several of my nurses are BEAR NAKED lovers!!!!!
1761	2	If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others. I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad. From a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch, but if you're looking for S/V flavor these have  just a touch. 
1762	5	I think everyone has had these and loved them. An American staple. I've been eating them since my youth. Cheap and tasty. Can't go wrong with Red Vines. They are best when they are fresh and not hard. I tend to buy them and they are hard which is a dissappointment. I remember in the early 1990's there was a green apple version of these that was very good or maybe it was another brand. I liked those the best. Never seen them since. Anyone remember those?
1763	3	Coffee is yummy, better than Kuerig, but one of the packages was damaged and quite a few pods were cut open, making them unusable.
1764	5	We feed this food to our almost grown kitten. He loves it.  Since cats are carnivores, this food fits the bill as it is mostly JUST fish, not fillers like corn and grains that really are not good for cats.<br />I really didn't like feeding the cat canned food because it grosses me out.  This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.  You don't need to use a spoon to get it out of the pack.  Just rip it open and squeeze it out.
1765	4	This jerky is quite pricey for a 6.5 ounce bag, but it's one of the few I've found that is salty enough and doesn't contain a bunch of sweeteners.<br /><br />The smoke flavor is also pronounced.  Unfortunately, the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me.
1766	2	I ordered this product when it was on sale a while back, and got the 6 pack of boxes. After brewing a few tea bags, I thought the Red Goji/Raspberry flavor was indeed there, but the low amount of tea in each tea bag, didn't deliver almost any kind of caffeine lift. Each tea bag has very little tea in it. I called Lipton to complain, and the nice lady on the other end, pointed out that each tea bag has 1.2 grams of tea in it. (My box actually says 1.3g)  Hmm, I thought, how much tea by weight does an average tea bag of green tea have? My unflavored Meijer green tea bags have 2.2 grams of tea! The other two flavors of Lipton tea I bought also have a lot more tea in them when compared to the Red Goji/ Raspberry Lipton Tea. The Lipton Lemon Ginseng tea has 1.7 grams of tea, and the Orange passion fruit & Jasmine has 2.0 grams of tea! Why on earth has Lipton shortchanged the amount of tea in the Red Goji Tea? Just add some more green tea Please Lipton! This product is a disappointment!
1767	5	I originally purchased these for a friend, who recently converted to a vegan diet. She raved about it so much that I decided to try it out myself. These cookies are absolutely delicious. They have a very intense chocolate taste that is not overly sweet as some chocolate cookies can be. Highly recommended.
1768	5	5 stars, 10 if it were possible.<br />2 mini-doxies who ate homemade from birth to 2, then went onto 'natural' kibble (Holistic Blendz, Hund n Flocken) and developed urine crystals, then went to a vet kibble that got rid of the crystals but developed another crystal.  I needed a solution that wouldn't take all day to prepare, and without grain (dachshunds are better off with potatoes as their starch, no rice or corn).  First impressions - smells good helped by garlic and oh look! I can actually recognize the bits of potato, broccoli and carrots! - add water, so far pretty easy.  Add beef?  I can't bring myself to do the raw thing, but I get organic ground beef from Costco, poach it, and when it's cooled down I add it to the Europa.  Store 3-4 days worth in the frig, and it's done.  Doggies used to sniff at the kibble and swallow enough of it to sustain life.  Now they can't wait to eat.  They're down to healthy weights, which is key for doxie backs, and the vet proclaims the smooth is the  best looking dachshund  he has ever seen.  They're running and playing like puppies at the ripe old age of 7.  I give them Missing Link Plus supplements, Cosequin DS to keep joints in good shape.  I feel like I'm doing a good thing for them, and I want them around me for many more years to come. I can't thank Sojourner Farms enough for understanding the need for grain-free food, let alone the absolute purity of preparation and ingredients. Someone there actually thought about the dog first.  I'm sure it takes longer to prep and dehydrate the vegetables than to pulverize and kibble-ize something far less healthy, but Sojos is doing it anyway and I for one am grateful for the product.  Costly?  I can't even calculate the value when I see the difference it has made in my dogs after just 2 months.  They ship it free from the Sojos web site, and so does Amazon.  Friends, just do it.  You can make it in the time it takes you to cook supper. You'd do it for your kids.  And your dogs don't talk back!!
1769	5	Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.  However, this treat in my opinion is worth your money, as so many other healthy treats are expensive and taste not so great.  I hope you will enjoy them I do and my family does too.
1770	5	After tiring of making my dog's food from scratch I looked for an all natural product.  Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food; no  powdered protein  or other questionable substances.  My dog loves it but to be honest I have to tell you that she practically inhales anything that she thinks might be food. I have the reassurance that this product won't hurt her.  The turkey and brown rice from Newman's Own is also excellent.
1771	5	These tasty graham crackers are crispy, not too sweet, and a serving of 4 squares has 130 calories.  They come packaged in 6 stack packs, and the calorie count for the whole pack (8 squares) is 250.<br /><br />The flavor brought back childhood memories of a glass of milk and a couple graham crackers after school, and then out to play. In other words, the flavor hasn't changed much in the MANY years since I was a kid :>)<br /><br />The new packaging makes them convenient to take along with you, either to work, or school, or wherever.  The only drawback I see to the packaging is that you might eat the entire stack, since the package isn't easily resealed.<br /><br />Some reviews have mentioned their fat (from cottonseed oil) and sugar content, and I will add here that they also contain a good amount of sodium (170mg for 4 squares, 340mg for 8 squares). But I think that, as with all snack foods, you have to read labels, not overdo, and make choices based on your individual dietary needs/restrictions.<br /><br />For me, these were a healthy enough choice for a delicious snack.
1772	5	I have been buying this mayonnaise for at least ten years. The stuff makes my potato salad sublime. Great on fish too.
1773	4	I like this treat for my dogs as it's human grade product. Though all treats need like this should be supervised as some dogs eat too quick and can choke, I find this is definitely  safer and MUCH better quality than greenies or anything by pedigree etc.. none of them are human grade product.
1774	5	All of Manischewitz's  tube  soup mixes, (so called because they coem in celephane tubes), are a good value for the money.  They taste great, and are truly THE most condensed of soups -- ONLY the dry ingredients are given, you add your own liquid, and thus save money, (not paying for water, as in other  condensed  soups), saving room in your pantry, and NOT having to put unopened packages in the refrigerator or freezer, thus saving valuable space there.<br /><br />I chose the Manischewitz Vegetable Cello Soup with Mushrooms, 6 ounce tubs, (Pack of 24), because I happen to LIKE mushrooms -- a lot.  But the interesting thing with all the tube soups offered by Manischewitz, is that they DO NOT contain an undue amount of salt!  One would think that an uncanned soup WOULD contain a LOT of salt, but this is not the case here.  Manischewitz obviously puts great faith in the protective power of cellophane, plastic wrappers -- and, thus, so should the customer!<br /><br />This is very tasty soup, which can be used as a complete soup, or as a soup base.<br />It is very inexpensive, because, as mentioned, you are NOT paying for water.<br />Make this -- and all other Manischewitz  tube  soups -- according to the directions, add your own ingredients if desired, and enjoy!  The money, pantry space, and refrigerator space,you will be saving, will make this delicious soup taste even better!  Enjoy - and I hope to see this, and other Manischewitz  tube  soups return to Amazon, very, very soon!
1775	4	I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is pretty good, although I haven't found a great number of cashews. I've had it in rather hot places and it does kind of lose its shape. That's annoying. Purchasing it through amazon.com was a breeze, I enjoyed having 12 at once and saving. This stuff is okay to buy in bulk because you can consume it so quickly.
1776	3	I placed this order on April 7, 2009 the package did not arrive by delivery; the package was damaged in delivery. The single piece of tape that was place on top of the package was damaged. The box was splitting in half and the items almost came out of the bottom of the package. The items were damaged from the box being to large for them and the stuffing did not work.
1777	5	This popcorn is really tasty and has recently been endorsed by Weight Watchers.  I have tried alot of the 94% FF and this one has a pretty light butter flavor...  Depends on what you like.
1778	4	Not something I'd want to eat often, or much at a time when I did, but as an occasional treat or for camping, etc. a good product.
1779	5	<span class= tiny > Length:: 0:22 Mins<br /><br /></span>I selected this item thinking I would try it out on my parents dogs, but when my husband saw it on the counter, he wanted to try it with Kitty. Ha! She hates everything; there is no way she is going to like this stuff. I was wrong. To my total and utter shock, my cat actually liked it. So, here's the video to prove it.
1780	5	I use Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla syrup daily in frozen coffee drinks as well as in oatmeal.  I am very pleased indeed.  The flavor is excellent for a sugar-free product and the larger sized bottle available from Amazon makes it efficient and economical as I now go through only one bottle about every two to three weeks (thus the three pack lasts about two months before I need more).  As always, the combination of Amazon's fast free delivery and fair price (no added taxes) makes this a highly recommended buy on an great product, plus if you want to save even more you can buy it on Amazon's subscription basis where you select the delivery frequency that suits your needs.  Torani and Amazon can't be beat for the combination of quality, reliability, and price.
1781	5	Great product for pet owners. Our cairn terrier, Maggie, requires<br />daily allergy medication.  It's great that we don't have to struggle<br />with her to take her meds. When she sees me reach for the pill<br />pockets she knows it's time take her medicine. Been using this<br />product for a while and will order again from amazon.com.  I highly<br />recommend this product.
1782	1	have been buying this product for three years.<br /><br />the 1 liter product by same brand tastes awesome (5 stars), but this smaller size product is terrible. surely, there's something wrong/amiss with this manufacturer - how can the same two products taste so different?<br /><br />sadly, the big size is out of stock and not to be found anywhere (tried amazon and all whole foods, etc.) - whole foods says the product is not avail for last 3 months.<br /><br />am writing this negative review hoping the company reads it and kindly brings back the big size product with the same original taste - will change the review if they do that.<br />thanks!
1783	1	I was looking for miso soup and just bought  this bowl in supermarket for comparison with instant miso soup in packages.  I don't like the bowl soup at all. I'd say it's not miso soup but plain noodle soup and noodle tastes not very pleasant. There is no miso taste and preparation takes too long. Instant miso in packages tastes great and there is no way I change my preference. BTW the best bet on instant miso packages I found is my local  Trader Joe's Instant Miso Soup. The box contains 4 packets, each packet yield  2 cups soup, so it produces 8 cups soup for just about $5 with great miso taste. Even Amazon cannot beat that deal.
1784	2	Let me just say that I had a choice between this meal and saltines and I chose the saltines. At least they don't have that overpowering sweet soy sauce taste. It was an empty meal. The cover gives a false impression of a more hardy, diverse product than that which I discovered when I opened the bland noodle package. It tasted like I was doing myself harm in the consumption of the noodle bowl; like I was dangerously close to my maximum dosage of sodium and sugar. It is cheap and its GREAT that the bowl is biodegradable. But please, make it taste like food and charge more. If I wanted to eat sweetened flour for a low price then I'd eat fast food. I'd rather pay a bit more for a good product.
1785	1	I ordered a box of the Omaha Steaks Top Sirloins and it was like eating shoe leather. Toughest meat I've ever had.  There was absolutely no flavor to the steak and I didn't want to waste it so I gave it to my dogs
1786	1	didn't buy this through Amazon i got it at the grocery store but i wanted to post a review. I have never hated a soup before. but this soup tastes like crap. i had 2 bites and set it aside because it tates so bad. i like other select harvest soups. i dont know if it's because this is my first light soup of theirs because i dont remember what ones i got. i am at work right now so i can't check. but i wanted to let people know about this soup tasting bad so i don't forget to write about it when i get home.
1787	2	I was disappointed with this tea.  The taste was no better than Liptons Yellow Label Tea.  I expected more from a Stash loose tea since I have had good expereience with some of their tea bags.
1788	2	I bought these seeing that other feedback said they were good for cake pops but in my opinion they are not. the black part of the eyeball is so small it makes it look funny, they are not thick and round like in the pic.
1789	1	I don't know why but they changed the recipe or I got 2 bad bags of cookies in the last 2 weeks from local store.  I used to love these but they don't have the same chocolate taste.  I recomend Newman's.
1790	5	Thanks Bob, this soy flour adds great flavor when mixed with gluten free flour, it also helps bind and gives a nice crunchy crust to pies.
1791	5	An  herbal  type tea, with real ginger and some lemon flavors, including lemongrass.  Also contains safflower, hibiscus, and some soy. Like a  ginger ale  tea.
1792	5	Love the packaging of this tea - the bags are biodegradable, have no flavor, and allow for the expansion of the leaves contained inside. Yes, you read right: this tea bag contains intact tea leaves, like loose leaf, not fannings like most major bagged teas. Dream! This is def. the tea I've been waiting for. I don't know how they package these things without breaking leaves, but it's the best tea bag packaging I've seen. I actually prefer other flavors they have opposed to this one, but most people I know adore the green leaf tropical. Good buy for 3 boxes.
1793	3	Read the ingredients:<br /><br />Chicken, turkey, chicken meal, turkey meal, cracked pearled barley, whole grain brown rice, oatmeal, millet, white rice, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), potatoes, egg product, tomato pomace, duck, salmon, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, natural chicken flavor, potassium chloride, salt, choline chloride, dried chicory root, kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberry powder, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-Carnitine, dried fermentation products of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D supplement, folic acid.<br /><br />There are a lot of fillers in this food. While it has good ingredients, I would highly recommend you spend the extra money on a better product if you can afford the extra $10-$20 for a way better product. This is much better than Iams or Beneful or any other grocery store dog food but I'm just not crazy about feeding something with so many fillers.
1794	5	Love it with bread and butter. If you haven't tried this before, I suggest you put a very little because the taste is strong. It really you love it or hate it!
1795	5	I agree with other review that this is a nice bold coffee but at the same time very smooth without any bitterness.<br />Similar to Americano coffee sold at well known coffee shops that sell for close to $4. This comes out to $.40 a cup! I never buy coffee in the chain stores anymore. The Keurig coffee maker eliminates the need to find a good cup of Joe. I first got a trial of how good this coffee is when I was at a doctors office and they had this coffeemaker for the patients to make themselves a cup from. I soon saw one on a shopping network and ordered it and loved it but it was the mini one so I kept that for my office and bought the nice platinum model that is fantastic. Nice hot coffee and in different size choices. I do not know how the coffee comes out perfectly regardless of the size cup chosen. I think it has to do with the amount of water released during the process. I love the machine and this blend coffee.
1796	5	Ramen noodles are a great staple for overseas living. So glad to have found this great deal. So easy to just set it up to send me a case every month or two and then not have to think about re-ordering.
1797	5	My 21 year old son takes these to school and to work.  He thinks they are great and has been asking for more, so here I am buying another case (again!)  They really are an inexpensive and easy way to prepare lunch... a whole lot better than fast food.
1798	3	I have bought and enjoyed the other Primal products, so I thought that I would give these a whirl. Overall flavor is not bad, I just find these dry and kind of blah. They do not have the intense flavor of the Primal jerkies. I suppose the other thought is that perhaps different lots or batches of these products are better than others, who knows what the quality control in Taiwan is comprised of? These items are very difficult to open without a knife or scissors, so don't plan on opening away from home. Overall they seem a bit too dry, they actually break apart as you try to remove them from the package. Pros: Another Veggie option for us. Cons: Hard to open, only okay flavor and a bit on the dry side.
1799	5	This is review for the tea, Red label tea has been around in India since ages and is awesome when fresh (make sure it is not expired). Traditional method is<br />-- boil water with  team<br />-- add flavors fresh cinnamon sticks, clove, ginger<br />-- filter and set tea apart<br />-- warm 1% milk<br />-- add 75% mild, 25% filtered tea<br />-- enjoy with biscuits!
1800	5	Been using my Keurig for a year now... every morning without fail and this flavor is my hubby's favorite... just a perfect blend of flavors...good and robust yet with just the right amount of Hazelnut... I use the subscribe and save feature and get it delivered monthly..it's convenient and a much better price that way!
1801	5	I was unsure if I would like this tea because I dont like licorice, but I thought I would give it a try anyway because I have heard it was good. Well, I love it. I no longer have to add hardly any splenda to my teas any more. It is like sugar!
1802	1	The box says pack of 24 but I only received 23 in the box. I recounted it 4 times. It really ticks me off because of the lack of professionalism in packaging. Worst part, I can't find a way to get my money back or get in contact with them to state my case. It's only 1 missing slim jim so it's not a big deal, I hate being lied to and ripped off. This also makes me wonder, are all the boxes only containing 23 but states 24? That's false advertisement. Regardless, not satisfied and wouldn't buy again.
1803	5	The quality cannot be beat--the ingredients are 100% tomatoes. No sugar, salt or citric acid and BPA free packaging (for those in doubt, read up, check the Pomi website, etc). They come from Italy, which requires some air miles but they are grown pesticide free, GMO free and the packaging consists of 75% renewable resources. Sure, USDA organic cert would be nice, but personally I'll take EU standards over that. These tomatoes taste fresh and delicious and are so easy to store.
1804	5	Love Cytomax. When biking, I follow the instructions on the label on the proportions, when I use it for running, I cut it in half, it seems to be too much for me. Either way, love the product!
1805	4	This syrup is really delicious!  After using this maple syrup, I'll never buy anything less than 100% pure maple syrup. I  like this brand a lot, but the price was fair and we were able to get the extra discount in addition. If they continue to offer it, we would buy from them again. I did a bit of research in my goal to find a fair priced, 100% maple syrup. I settled on this one, and we have been so happy with it! When we serve it with company,  they seem to love it also.
1806	4	This cat food was on a list of possibles for diabetic cats.  The cat liked it.
1807	5	This candy is very true to color, as yellow will be lemon, red will be cherry, etc.  The only little problem is that the  candies do stick together at times.
1808	1	They came in the middle of the summer and the packaging looked OK but had no protection from moisture and the jelly beans are a soggy mess.  Do not purchase.
1809	5	Yes, they're hard and really spicy, but I like it!  And what other cookie can you eat 5 of for only 140 calories and 11 grams of sugar?  And ginger is an anti-inflammatory spice that is good for headaches, arthritis, high blood pressure, you name it!  And they're made with whole wheat and no refined sugar... Wow, this is the world's most perfect cookie!
1810	5	these are my favorite by far.  and just to clarify, I did talk to Muir Glen and they confirmed that the cans used for tomatoes ARE BPA FREE.
1811	1	The product description claims  It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors.  This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether  diet  or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the  Dr. Pepper : hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.
1812	5	I have 3 Coton's and they're very picky. I bought these at Costco and ever since then, they will not eat anything else for snacks. Not only do they love them, but their teeth look great! I was truly disappointed when I went to Costco last month and found out they'd discontinued them?? I looked all over town and finally found them online. I even went directly to the manufacturer, and get this... they said they would only sell them to me if I bought $150.00 worth??? That alone would of stopped me from buying them again.. but what can you do when your dogs love them.. and you LOVE your dogs!!
1813	5	We have been using this brand of pasta for over a year now and absolutely love it.  It does not taste funny as the whole wheat pastas do, nor does it have any strange chewiness.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to stay away from gluten or who is cooking for those with diabetes.  It does not affect the blood sugar the same way regular pasta does at all, nor does it have the same glycemic index.  Cooking time is a few minutes longer, but the product is always delicious.
1814	5	What a wonderful product! My Dog absolutely Loves it! He is almost human. He is a Veggie and Fruit Dog. I am just about ready to order again!!
1815	5	I'm not a huge flavored coffee person, but I really love these! The coffee is mild to medium bodied and the flavoring isn't overpowering. It's got a great aroma (the co-worker next to me always loves when I brew one of these) and a clean, distinct taste.<br /><br />I've got these on Subscribe and Save!
1816	5	HAPPY WITH DELIVERY OF THESE JAWBREAKERS. THE 30 LB BOX LASTS FOR MONTHS. THE CANDY IS GREAT THEY ARE VERY GOOD TASTING AND ENJOYABLE. I HAVE THEM ON REGULAR SCHEDULED DELIVERIES YOU SAVE MONEY THAT WAY. MY HUSBAND TAKES THEM TO WORK AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO VISIT HIS DESK ARE DELIGHTED WITH THEM. IF YOU WANT A GOOD TASTING HARD CANDY THEN THESE ARE PERFECT.
1817	4	It was touted by a friend as a sleep inducer, so I tried it and it works.  It tastes kinda mediciney, but it definitely does the job.
1818	5	Being the natural freak that I am since having my little one I had been debating back and forth on whether to get a baby food maker knowing that I would only be happy if I was able to make my own food and know exactly what was being put in it.  I had heard everybody say  Oh...you don't need one of those fancy things.  All you need is a pot, some steam, and a fork.  That is the way we used to do it. <br />After looking at several brands I decided that the baby brezza looked worth the $100.  Let me say I was totally right.  This thing is awesome.  I spend about an hour or two a week (usually on a Sunday) dicing veggies and fruit, put everything into the baby brezza, push the button, and voila! Baby food complete.  I just pour it out of the canister into freezer safe containers and store it frozen for the whole week or two. It is a breeze to clean, does an awesome job making a smooth puree, and saves me tons of money by not having to buy organic baby food.<br />I would definettly recommend this product to anyone thinking of making their own baby food.  It makes our jobs as mom's a breeze!
1819	4	I have been making black tea in my bodum iced tea pitcher and wanted to try a nice loose green. This one works perfectly. It has a mild taste that is very fresh.
1820	5	This was a very good product! I loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone!! I plan on ordering more when I can.
1821	5	This is more than just Earl Grey, the flavor and the fragrance are intense. After this tea, the other brands are just bland. I love this tea.
1822	5	Our daughter has several food allergies, so Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars are perfect!  Out of all the Gluten-free cookies out there, my daughter just LOVES Nana's.  NO eggs, NO dairy, NO refined sugar, NO hydrogenated oils, NO Cholesterol, NO Casein, NO Soy, NO Corn.  They are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie.  I do not personally like the texture, but the chocolate flavor is good.  I will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies, but not someone who can have regular cookies.
1823	4	My Border Collie really enjoys the stix.  My concern is that there is no labeling that tells me exactly what the produce is made of nor is there a nutritional breakdown.
1824	5	This candy was excellent, very soft and fresh still. Tastes almost like strawberry marshmallows more than a gummy. However it was 6 dollars for one pretty small bag, because it is an import.<br /> http://www.amazon.com/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Strawberries-5-Ounce/dp/B000EVQWKW/ref=pd_sbs_gro_12  Amazon has almost the exact same thing, 12 packs for $14 so closer to 1 dollar per pack instead of 6. If you love this candy, that's the way to go.
1825	4	I've been using this for about two months (always at least once a day), and while I definitely can say,  Sure, this is okay,  I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest or recommend it.<br /><br />I like that there are no super crazy or funky ingredients.  I can put this all over my eyes with zero irritation and no itching, and I have to admit I really love the smell (yum!)--it seems a lot stronger when you first start using it, but it disappears pretty quickly.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT: The cream is a white, thin lotion that spreads easily.  It's not the kind of lotion that instantly absorbs into your skin, and a little goes a long way!  There is going to be a moist film left behind for a while, so if you're an instant-absorption sort of person, this might catch you off-guard. However, I like that it doesn't instantly dry because my eyes feel more hydrated.<br /><br />THE PACKAGING: There are several comments talking about how crappy the pump is and how it 'breaks' easily.  I haven't experienced it directly breaking, but I can see how people might have problems.  The pump doesn't pull lotion from very deep inside the bottle, so it leaves behind a gap in the lotion eventually each time you pump because it doesn't  settle  to fill the spot after use.  If you squeeze from the bottom of the bottle a little bit before using or unscrew the top and jostle the bottle a bit, you'll be able to  fill  that hole created over time through using the pump.<br /><br />RESULTS:  I'm in my early 20s and have been blessed with pretty good genes, so wrinkles and puffy under-eyes really aren't a huge issue for me.  However, I really love how moisturizing and hydrating this cream is.  The smell is pleasant, and I'm probably about halfway through the tube in two months, so I'd say it's a decent bang for my buck.<br /><br />Give it a shot!  If wrinkles and puffiness are a concern for you, this might not be your holy grail product, but it's also inexpensive enough that I think it's worth trying out without feeling awful if it doesn't work.<br /><br />One tiny note - I don't know if this is relevant, but I have noticed since using this product I seem to have gained a small cluster of freckles around my eyes in places I've never had freckles before.  I don't know if it's from this product, but it certainly struck me as unusual.
1826	1	VERY Disappointing --- doesn't taste like coffee and is extremely bitter.  I may try the house blend or a flavor -- but not before I taste a sample.
1827	1	I purchased the cases of this cereal because it is organic, it fills me up, and due to the nose dive recognized within the U.S. economy over the past four years, I am no longer able to afford much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last three cases I have ordered via Amazon have been stale.  I contemplated leaving this feedback because I am just thankful to have anything to eat.  However, after three cases of stale cereal that leaves an after taste due to the stale quality, I am having a difficult time stomaching this cereal anymore.<br /><br />For a couple more dollars, which I really did now wish to spend, but I am going to try to do so now, I have found that Nature's Path Kamut Puffs are  by far  extremely fresh in comparison.  It may be the Eco-bag that Nature's Path packages their cereal in, verses the softer plastic that Arrowhead packages their cereal in.  Not sure.
1828	5	Although this tea didn't cure my bladder infection, I like to think that it helped!  At any rate, it tastes wonderful, not as tart as I had expected.
1829	1	I was all excited to get these Planters Big Triple Nut Bars because the photo on the box looks like crispy peanut brittle studded with giant almonds and cashews. Even better, there's my good friend Mr. Peanut tipping his top hat with one white-gloved hand, holding his cane at a jaunty angle in the other. He's got such a big grin on his face, I know he's winking at me from behind that monocle! Yes, the box says  chewy granola bars , but I thought that would mean that they are both delicious AND healthy.<br /><br />Wrong! Mr. Peanut, how could you do this to me?<br /><br />First of all, the packaging is very deceptive. The box could hold 10 or 11 bars instead of 5. Yes, it's more than twice the volume of the product it holds and that is deceptive. The photo of the bar itself is enlarged approximately 100% so maybe that was the excuse. In reality, the bars are very small, weighing a tad over 1 1/2 ounces each and measuring about 1 1/4 inches wide by 4 3/4 inches long by 5/8 of an inch thick.<br /><br />The smell is okay, like roasted peanuts, pretty much what you would expect.<br /><br />But what about the taste?<br /><br />The flavor is pretty much one note, peanuts. That's the only thing I could taste. Normally, that would be a good thing because I love peanuts! Unfortunately, the peanuts taste stale and have an unpleasant aftertaste. The bars are also way too sweet and much too salty. (I had to brush my teeth and use mouthwash both to get rid of the taste.)<br /><br />I couldn't see any cashews or almonds in the bar at all. I did finally find one and a half very small almonds buried inside as I broke off each bite looking for the nuts. I couldn't identify any cashews by sight or by taste and I could identify the almonds only by sight and by the slight crunch, no almond flavor either.<br /><br />The texture (other than the tiny crunch from the almonds) is like soft peanuts mixed with cornmeal and coated in sticky soft goo. I really didn't enjoy the texture at all, it just didn't feel good on my teeth when biting down.<br /><br />I'm not surprised I couldn't tell the cashews from the peanuts but I couldn't even tell the oats from the peanuts by texture or taste and barely by sight because of the sticky goo.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know what was worse, the soft sticky texture or the cheap bitter peanut taste or the overwhelming sweetness or the heavy saltiness.<br /><br />Actually, I do know what is worse than all of that: the ingredient list and nutrition information. The box touts the 7 grams of protein but neglects to highlight the 12 grams of fat and 23 grams of carbohydrates. (An ounce is a little over 28 grams so that's quite a bit of fat and sugar.)<br /><br />The one good thing I see is a lot of vitamin E because of the tocopherols added as a flavor preservative.<br /><br />Other things that bother me are that the crisped rice is rice flour, sweeteners are listed eight times, and almonds and cashews are listed just before the under-1.5% ingredients. Since peanuts aren't really nuts (they're legumes), I think putting  Big Nut Bars  and  Triple Nut  on the package is very deceptive given the scarcity of the cashews and almonds and calling them granola bars is a bit of a stretch as well.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Peanuts<br />Corn syrup<br />Crisped rice (rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, caramel color, mixed tocopherols)<br />Peanut butter (roasted ground peanuts)<br />Sugar<br />Evaporated cane juice invert syrup<br />Whole grain rolled oats<br />Almonds<br />Cashews<br /><br />Contains less than 1.5% of:<br /><br />Whey (from milk)<br />Soy lecithin<br />Salt<br />Honey<br />Vegetable oil (peanut and/or cottonseed oil)<br />Resistant corn dextrin<br />Granola (whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain wheat, coconut, canola oil, wheat bran)<br />Xanthan gum<br />Mixed tocopherols<br /><br />Nutrition Information:<br /><br />Serving size one bar (46g or 1.62 oz)<br />Calories 220<br />Calories from Fat 100<br />Total fat 12g (18% of daily value)<br />Saturated fat 1.5g (8% of daily value)<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Polyunsaturated fat 3.5g<br />Monounsaturated fat 6g<br />Cholesterol 0%<br />Sodium 230mg 10%<br />Total carbohydrates 23g 8%<br />Dietary fiber 3g 12%<br />Sugars 13g<br />Protein 7g 7%<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 6%<br />Vitamin E 110%<br />Phosphorus 10%<br /><br />It may seem silly to give such a long review of these candy bars but I really felt let down by Planters, Kraft, and especially Mr. Peanut. I know these aren't gourmet brands but my experience is that they have consistently decent quality. It really seems like this product was just an excuse to use up low-quality and leftover ingredients by creating a sweet, salty snack food to make people fat and give them diabetes and cavities. Offhand, I can't think of a less enjoyable way to eat 220 calories especially when almost half of them are from fat.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Mr. Peanut, but I think it is kinder to be honest with you because we've been friends for such a long time. I would want you to tell me if I didn't taste good to you, either!
1830	5	I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.
1831	1	I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.<br /><br />It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross.
1832	4	My grandkids and I love these dried apples. I used to buy them at Costco or BJ's but for some reason they no longer carry them. Some stores have a variety pack, but we just like the apples and the pears are good also. I tried other brands, but we like these the best. Wish we could buy them on LI again..
1833	5	I have never taken a green tea supplement before this one, and my experience with it has been pretty good.  The good news is that I did not feel any negative side effects but I was taking this for weight loss and I did not lose very much weight at all while on this.  When I began taking raspberry ketones along with the green tea, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G >Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>, this is when I started to actually lose weight.<br /><br />I read an article that said taking them together created synergistic weight loss effects, and so far I have lost six pounds in the past 17 days compared to just a couple pounds when I took the green tea on its own.  There are a lot of good health benefits to be had by taking green tea on its own too but for energy and weight loss, adding raspberry ketones to the mix has been great.
1834	5	Glutino pretzels are by far the best tasting on the market.<br />These actually made my kids believe that being GF wasn't going to be so bad<br />if they could still have a good pretzel to snack on!
1835	1	I purchased this product at the end of November. It had a very bland taste. The flavor you get at the bottom of the coffe can after a month of opening and closing it. I checked the freshness date. It was dated Feb 2012. So it should have still tasted good. I love the instant coffee that they sell in the jars. Too bad this is only available in drink straws. I'll never buy again.
1836	5	This gutsy spirit worked it well neat or mixed in a traditional whiskey sour with friends.  I would recommend using this hand-crafted spirit for a variety of cocktailing and drinking occasions!<br /><br />[...] Detail:<br />Born and bred in New York's Finger Lakes Distillery, White Pike Whiskey is a refined spirit made of locally grown corn, spelt and malted wheat. Distilled with precision and aged in 18 minutes, White Pike is buttery through the middle and finishes smooth, still young enough to mix in ways brown whiskeys won't. Easy drinking and uniquely versatile, shoot it fast, sip it slow, or mix it with anything from pomegranate to pickle brine. With a backbone strong enough for traditional whiskey lovers and rebels alike, enjoy White Pike how you want it, as you are.
1837	5	I made these according to package directions, and added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips, and they were awesome!  They took longer to cook than the box says, maybe that's because of the chocolate chips.  Either way, they were great and I'll definitely make them again.
1838	5	Enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste.  The 16-count Pack of 6 represents an excellent buy compared to store prices.
1839	5	I like  Stephen`s  Gourmet Hot  Cocoa , White  Chocolate  Mix ,because to me  it taste like  Arabian  White  Chocolate ,the taste is  almost identical ,if it had a little  Arabian vanilla  it would  be a copy cat. This  cocoa  to me  has  alot of  class ,unlike the others this  Stephens white chocolate  mix has alot of  class .I just  have to  say  Thankyou  Stephen ,I really enjoy sipping white hot  cocoa  again.  A friend told  me how  delicious  this  cocoa  was ,I never imagined  how  delicious . I am  so  glad  I purchased  it,  THANKYOU STEPHEN , A customer  for  life !  Terry Merrill
1840	5	I'm usually a strictly black tea drinker - I don't need anything too fancy in the morning. After trying Numi's Chocolate Puerh, it's going to be hard to go back to basics. It has a great chocolate flavor which blends perfectly with the flavor of the tea. It is rich, but not overpowering - drinks great with or without milk. Great way to start the morning, or equally good as a nightcap before bed. Definitely worth trying.
1841	5	Love this Green Tea supplement.  It's hard to find a Green Tea supplement that is decaffinated and yet also has a high EGCG count per capsule, this supplement has it!  Thanks!
1842	1	These were gross. It was like chomping down on a chunk of salt. I regret wasting my money and will not purchase in the future
1843	5	I wanted to use the concentrated pump creamer because of the convenience and savings.  However, I could only find the food service size, which was approximately 40 ounces!  The creamer goes bad after 6 months and I ended up throwing out a lot of product.  I was browsing Amazon the other day and found this 21.1 ounce size and was so excited!  The convenience I wanted and not something that is so large it will spoil before I can use it.  And if you still really want creamer in the fridge in the pour bottle, save a coffee-mate pour bottle, wash it out, pump some of this into it and add water.  It's the same thing and you can continue to refill it for a fraction of the cost.  I also save those store-bought coffee mate creamer containers with the spout on them to keep sugar in, restaurant style, so that I can keep my baking sugar away from people's dirty coffee spoons, and it works like a charm.  If you are all about saving money but not sacrificing flavor, buy this product!
1844	5	I love this organizer. I am able to organize my K Cups by caffeine level, flavor, etc. Drawers easily slide in and out. I agree with the other posts that tell you to alternate cups up and down to get even more cups in the organizer. Great price on Amazon.
1845	5	Any dog puppy to senior and any breed dog loves these treats.  They go crazy over them!!!  They are healthy too.  I have been buying them for a few years now.  How I first found out about them is I read an article online about the oldest dog to live ate these treats.  So that made me want to buy them for the health of them.  So I do feel good about feeding healthy treats that dogs really like the taste of!!!
1846	4	I really, really, really like pecans. These are very good, but I wouldn't say they taste like pecan pie.  The taste reminds me of the crunchy pecan topping on my sweet potato casserole recipe. That topping is made with brown sugar, flour and butter. I find it hard to stop eating these. I eat them for a snack, take a few, take a few more, and a few more...and then have to put the bag in a hard-to-reach spot so I don't keep eating them.<br /><br />See the above  Important Information  for the ingredient list &  Nutrition Facts. 
1847	5	Love this coffee, most k-cups are stronger than we are used to having with a regular coffee pot. So this is perfect. Can even get a couple of extra uses out of it for other cups of coffee. Good prices on Amazon for k-cups!
1848	5	I usually prepare about 3 lbs of meat at a time. I have not used ground meat yet, but instead thinly sliced roast or london broil. This marinade is excellent, not too peppery, and cures the meat very well. I experimented with madinade time, and found that overnight is not enough time. The meat goes into a gallon storage bag (3 lbs with TWO marinade packs stirred into about 1 cup of water) for a minimum of two days. I massage the bad to ensure the meat is well coated with marinade. Then about 7 hours in the dehydrator is all it takes to have outstanding jerky. I made a few batches last Christmas and gave it away as gifts. My grown children raved about it. Look for the 18 pack box to save money.
1849	2	This is for Costa Rica blend. I do not like giving bad reviews but I rely on reviews myself , so I feel it important. Amazon sent me an email about their newest kcups and I was excited to try them. After looking at all choices and description, and reviews, although they were hard to find since most were for the variety pack; I chose the Costa Rica blend. I did not want too bold a coffee and this seemed to fit the bill. After trying two brews with different strengths, this coffee just tastes   off  and like an inexpensive coffee. It actually upset my stomach causing acid, with very little consumed. Specifically, though, the taste is weak, like old coffee;  not smooth or full flavor, and the smell which I noticed immediately-had an unpleasant aroma. Not the great coffee smell we all welcome with our morning coffee. Maybe I got a bad batch but the date was ok and these are new, so I think it's the way they are. I cannot recommend.
1850	4	There are quite a few foods I like better than sardines but I eat a tin now and then because they're (supposedly) healthful and very convenient.  I've tried most of the common grocery store varieties and found these to be the best of them, primarily because, as the box says, they are  meaty portions cleaned and scaled.   Compared to others, there's less icky bits in the tin, and they do have a nice meaty texture that reminds you more of a real fish meal and less of leftover bait.  The marinara sauce is expectedly watery and flavorless; I add hot sauce or other spices.  Yes, the ad copy all over the box is hyperbolic but presumably you're not buying them for reading material.
1851	5	I absolutely love this product. It has a wonderful taste. It is light on the caffeine, but you can mix it with regular coffee and it taste great! I add a little whip cream on top and feel like I have Starbucks right in my kitchen. The Chai Latte is absolutely wonderful too!!! (Light caffeine as well, but a wonderful soothing and calming treat) The Chai Latte taste exactly like the one you can order from SB, but it's half the $ and you don't have to drive anywhere to get it! Highly recommend  both of these products!!!!! (One thing I do do different is brew a the smaller cup, which I believe gives it more flavor and especially if you want to add regular coffee, you'll still have room in your coffee cup.)
1852	5	Really delicious stuff. The mint ice cream has actual chocolate chips (it doesn't dehydrate) and tastes like the real thing.
1853	3	Last summer, our family discovered <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC734G >Izze Sparkling Juice Variety Pack - 12/12 Oz Btls</a> and used them for special treats on really hot days. They were refreshing and because they did not add any sugar we could fool ourselves into thinking they were healthy (they are healthier...)<br /><br />When we saw Switch, we thought we might be getting even more of the same in new flavors.  Unfortunately, these are more syrupy than the Izzy's.  At least for adults, the are less crisp and refreshing.  However, kids would of course prefer these as they are sweeter.<br /><br />We also tried Watermelon/Strawberry and we liked the Kiwi Berry better.  The watermelon/Strawberry had a much more Jolly Rancher like taste. I think we are going to stick to our Izzy's I think.
1854	4	A little expensive but very convenient.  My 5 year old would eat the whole box if I let him (and he is a super picky eater).
1855	5	Other than a few table scraps, Canidae is the only brand (dry and wet) we feed to our blk lab.  She's done excellent on it and has a very healthy and shinny coat.  People routinely comment how nice her coat looks, most even ask what we feed.  I sent a bag to my brother and he too noticed his dog's coat was healthier looking after a week or two.  I highly recommend this product.
1856	1	This product sells for $4.69 in New York City, the Bronx  and in<br />South Jersey (in Shoprite) for $4.69 a can.  Amazon is selling it for over five dollars a can, and you have to buy the case. Get it at the store. The formula is great just amazon has it over priced
1857	2	We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.
1858	4	This gingerbread is very good if you're used to eating healthy whole wheat foods. I like the real molasses and ginger flavor and the denseness of the bread. It is very moist and not too sweet.
1859	5	Best tasting Hazelnut coffee I have found in a k-cup.  Wish it was sold in an 80 pack, instead of 50.
1860	1	I just called up customer service and found that since October 2011, all the jars are BPA free. BUT...the jars manufactured before October,2011 are still available in the market. Usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed. So the jars with BPA lining on the lids are still floating around in the market. The consumers cannot tell the difference. So what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is BPA free or not??? This is very very disappointing from earth's best.
1861	5	*Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!
1862	5	Residing in Canada, finding honeybush is quite difficult except in pricey upscale tea shops. My local tea shop has it but the price is approximately 20$/oz.<br /><br />Here comes Amazon and Davidson's Tea where I could finally buy it in bulk for a reasonable price. The honeybush appears fresh and it has that strong aroma when you open the bag. Once brewed, it is not the tastiest drink but it is good served hot during a cold winter or iced cold during a hot sunny summer day. I add cinnammon, cardamom and/or lime zest to add taste to it.<br /><br />It is healthy, caffeine-free and cheap, what could I ask more ? One advice though, transfer it to a sealed contained as Davidson's bags are not made for long-term storage.
1863	5	I enjoy cooking and need to watch carbohydrates because of my husband's diabetes. I was shocked to read the label of cornstarch and see how it is loaded with carbs. This arrowroot powder works just fine in all of my recipes; it is smooth and silky and much lower in carbs. Being vegetarian, it is also handy for thickening all kinds of sauces and tofu-based recipes.
1864	5	This oil though not from actual truffles has a fantastic aroma it is strong so only a few drops are needed to give a delicious finishing taste to sauces pizza and or whatever you want to put it on. I got the smaller bottle and I am kicking myself for not shelling out a few more bucks. Whoever is claiming that its not good or only three stars is a moron who doesn;t know anything, Once again it is not from real truffles but does taste a hell of a lot like them. Black has a pungent aroma, and the white is more sophisticated and cleaner taste.
1865	5	I gave them 1/4 of a can at first of the venison brand to each of my 2 cats(bought a can of each flavor to test first).  They polished it off like they were starving, and then continued to nag me until I gave them the rest of the can! (believe me having a cat constantly meowing in your face can be pretty annoying, LOL).  They didn't show such gusto with Proplan canned.  I like that it doesn't have corn or wheat gluten which is hard to find with the regular foods on the market.  Also, one of my cats has IBS and has trouble with some foods irritating his stomach, he had no trouble with this.  My cats give it 4 paws up each!
1866	5	the only dog treat i will use in the future--only 2 calories each, healthy and my picdog loves them
1867	5	I could not find unsweetened coconut in the grocery stores so ordered this product.  It is wonderful, finely grated and fresh tasting. Coconut does not need added sugar--it is naturally sweet. I am type 2 diabetic so I look for products that so not have added sugar
1868	4	This cereal is ok, tastes like most other brands. I was raised on Skinner's Raisin Bran and it is what I like, but it is hard to find, so I tried Cascadian. I will not buy anymore Raisin Bran until I find Skinner's.
1869	5	Sometimes I have low blood sugar.  Several times my blood sugar dropped so low as to concern my doctors.  I asked what I could do and the diabetic nurse suggested I keep some pure apple juice available.  I found Motts to be a reliable brand.<br /><br />Motts Apple Juice suggests  8 ounces as a serving.  The nurse suggested that 4 Ounces should be my first dose.  Four ounces of apple juice has 15 grams of carbs and 13 grams of natural sugar.  I discovered that the 4 oz.  serving reliably raises my blood sugar 25 points, which is usually enough to reach  the rescue goal of 75 bg (mg/dl).<br /><br />I have concluded that apple juice is a natural healthy beverage for most humans.  Motts is tasty and not very acidic.  The 4oz. Serving is a natural  pick me up  available for everyone.  I am very happy with this product.
1870	2	I really hate giving a negative review to anything. That being said, I was not impressed with this product. It's called Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero sauce, but it was not bold and it was not spicy. It had a bland taste to it. It was not a bad taste, just bland. It was creamy though. I was hoping it was Taco Bell's Volcano sauce being marketed under a different name for supermarkets, but it wasn't. There was a slight chipolte taste to it, but I think there are better products out there. I tried this sauce on Taco Bell's new triple steak flatbread and ended up having to put some steak sauce on as well. I would not recommend this and it looks like others feel the same way as I have being seeing this on the shelfs of close-out store Big Lot's.
1871	5	First of all, I brew a lot of teas and coffees at home.  I grind my own coffee beans, have my own herb garden and use loose leaf teas 95% of the time.  I live in a rural area that doesn't have a Starbucks on every corner.  I have to travel 35 miles to the nearest Starbucks and even then I am loathe to spend $5.00 for a cup of coffee, Starbucks brand or not.<br /><br />However, I thought this coffee was some of the best ground and flavored coffee that I had ever brewed at home.  I LOVE vanilla and when you open the package you can even SEE the ground vanilla bean in the coffee.<br /><br />The coffee was very smooth and sweet and I just really loved the REAL ORGANIC vanilla taste.  When reading some of the other reviews, people said they couldn't taste or smell the vanilla in this coffee.  That's because most people are used to artificial vanilla flavorings or vanilla extracts (i.e. alcohol based) instead of whole bean vanilla.<br /><br />This coffee also has Indian Sarsaparilla Root as an ingredient. Sarsaparilla root comes from the sarsaparilla plant, a woody-climbing vine that grows in South America, the West Indies, Mexico and other tropical parts of the world. Sarsaparilla root has a pleasant fragrance and a spicy sweet taste that pairs well with the coffee bean used and the vanilla bean.<br /><br />All in all this coffee makes a lovely  cuppa  and I would DEFINITELY buy this coffee and serve it again!<br /><br />Happy Brewing!
1872	1	I ordered 3 of the item. $168!!!  You think I'd be getting 3 packages of 5 tubes of 10 capsules total of 150 capsules, which by the price it would be close to buying them from Nesspresso... think again. In fact you will receive 3 tubes, each with 10 capsuls! 30 capsules FOR $168! or $6 a cup of coffee. Sweet.<br />i might have Joker in my name, but this is no joke.
1873	5	I just love the flavor of this product. You need to also look at the canned energy drink that you can slowly drink and enjoy the great flavor.  I will continue to buy this item.  I suffer from chronic fatigue and this product really helps.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon
1874	4	Dog loves these - and he's about an 85 lb chow/german mix, so the large size is good for him.  I guess these are good and healthy for dogs - supposedly they are - but they're also pretty expensive.  These are also chewy - so it only takes him about 1-minute to devour - so you may want to take that into consideration if you're looking for something that will last a little longer . . .
1875	5	I am trying this coconut oil as a dietary supplement. By itself, 1 Tbsp tastes very rich and coco-nutty. Too rich for me so, I decided to put it in a cup of coffee. It was delicious!! I used Columbian coffee (Green Mountain, Fair Trade Select K-Cup), sugar and some hemp milk (Pacific Natural Foods). That is definitely a keeper!! If you don't drink coffee, I'm sure it would work great in a cup of hot cocoa as well.<br /><br />Later, I decided to try it in some oatmeal. I mixed the following into a cup of cooked oatmeal: 1/2 Tsp cinnamon, 2-3 Tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp coconut oil. When the coconut oil melted completely, I added 3-4 Tbsp hemp milk to cool it down. My taste-buds were amazed!! Tomorrow, I will try this with raisins. Mmmmm.<br /><br />We make a lot of fruit shakes at our house and I've had coconut in them before, so I know this will taste great in a shake too. Here's the recipe I'm going with: Banana, Cantaloupe, Orange Juice, Ice, Hemp Milk, Honey (maybe) and Coconut Oil.<br /><br />I still have to find one more meal that I can add this to in order to keep up with the recommended 4 x 1 Tbsp daily dosage, but I'm sure it will be no problem to find something else that this goes well with.
1876	4	It might look weird, but it does taste real good, a little dry though. A great tasting and healthy snack.
1877	5	This is great sugar. It has a beautiful blonde color and tastes like great sugar. I love that it is organic and fair trade. This is the best price I've found so far and the 10 lb bag will last me a long time. It also nice that it comes in a resealable bag too! Happy customer. Will buy again when I run out.
1878	5	1st , i buy a box , which is six or seven bags in it , i ate the whole box in days , went and i buy another box , ate 2 bags and the rest i gave to friend
1879	5	I had sent this gift to a friend of my mine on her birthday and she was delighted. She will cherish this for the rest of her life. The spice box was excelletnly packaged. She also uses the bag that it went in as a purse. Love this!!!
1880	4	I poured boiling water over the pod and worked it over really well with a spoon until the water was good and dark. This produced a good, full bodied coffee with a rich taste. For my next cup, I put the pod in a French press and let it set for a few minutes before pressing, and the flavor improved even more. If you don't have a single pod brewer, this is the way to brew an excellent, environmentally-friendly cup of coffee from the individual packets.
1881	5	Excellent!!! I love it. It is refreshing and has a good taste.  During and/or after working out I drink the water.
1882	5	I searched Google and found these k-cups. The price is reasonable.  Exceptionally fast delivery. I am very pleased and will order again.
1883	1	I've been into harissa for the last 2 years after reading about it in a recipe and been hooked since. Recently purchased this one because of the great price but that should've told me something. After receiving it I used in on a rice dish and I was disappointed in the flavor, oiliness and paste like constancy. I looked at the ingredients and the first thing listed was VEGETABLES???? I've learned that the main ingredient in harissa should be 'red chili peppers' not vegetables! I learned vegetables are used as a filler to make more product. Not buying this product ever again.
1884	5	Excellent treat for cats. My cat wakes up just by the noise of the plastic bag. Very useful when I'm looking for him, I just have to shake the Whiskas Temptations bag.
1885	2	I purchased the orange chocolate bar and was disappointed.  They were were almost bitter tasting. I gave them away to a health nut friend of mine and she couldn't eat them either.  Unless you are very fond of carob, I suggest you skip these. I am so desperate for someone to make a really good tasting chocolate candy using stevia.  I've looked all over the internet without luck.<br /><br />There is big opportunity here for an enterprising entrepreneur to make some big bucks.  I know there are thousands of people like me who need to eat less sugar (or none at all) who are very aware of the dangers of all the other fake sugars out there.  I'd do it, but I'm too old and don't have the ambition.<br /><br />So until someone out there gets rich by doing just that, I guess I'm stuck with trying to make my own -  so I bought a stevia cook book on Amazon.
1886	4	Decent cup of tea, agree with others, do not over brew!<br /><br />Like minimal packaging.
1887	5	This is my absolute FAVORITE hot chocolate! Stephen's Gourment Hot Cocoa is all over Utah, but I have been unable to find it anywhere else.  I love it so much that I even pay shipping and handling so that I can enjoy it all the way on the east coast, too.  It's SO good! I look forward to it every year.
1888	5	I was on the fence because of having to buy 6 containers at once. Days later, when I tasted the first bite, I was thanking myself for buying them. They are sweet and better than expected.<br /><br />I have not tried other organic raisin brands, and I lucked out. I will buy this brand every time I need raisins, and I will try this brand's cranberries and prunes too. I wish they offered more types, like cherries and blueberries and figs and apricots.
1889	5	An old inter-generational family tradition, we use this dressing to make a potato chip dip, mixing it with cream cheese.  We are glad to be able to buy it online rather than have family members send it from the midwest.
1890	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IZLQ >Stash Premium Orange Spice Black Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a><br /><br />This idem is very good for it's price. I have looked in different places in stores and on line and found no place too get it<br />for A better value for your money.
1891	5	Very good! So tasty you want more! My grandson even loved them & he usually does not like anything similer. I would buy again. Pricey but so good!
1892	4	Petite Cuisine is labeled as  People food for cats.  That's about right! If I didn't know it was for cats, I might have tried it because indeed, it looks and smells quite wonderful. The kinds of fish, too, are to my liking. Anytime I go to the sushi restaurant I get yellowfin, snapper, and tuna. However, and this is a big one, my cats have looked at it, tried it, and declined it. They usually eat Fancy Feast - the grilled kind - and I don't understand what in Petite Cuisine would not be to their liking. Maybe it's too healthy. It does have the ingredients one should like: fresh fish, juicy sauce, vitamins...<br />So I have to assume that to any reasonable and average cat, this would be perfectly satisfactory and more than that. I'd give it 5 stars if my cats ate it.
1893	2	I love Oreos. I love peanut butter. I love chocolate. Seems like a no-brainer that I should like these cookies, but I didn't. They were ok at best. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my kids give them a try. One of my sons didn't like them at all. The other son (who has more of a sweet-tooth) liked them a little. He liked them enough that he's going to eat more, but told me not to bring home any more. He'd rather have the original Oreos. If he was in the mood for PB & chocolate, he'd just rather have a Reese's.<br /><br />The other thing I'd like to point out is that I wouldn't really even consider these  cookies . They contain more PB & chocolate than cookie. The cookie wafer is really thin and is just overpowered by the other 2 ingredients. And the peanut butter part had too soft a consistency and not enough of a peanut flavor..
1894	5	Before buying this product, I was worried that there wouldn't be enough variety.  When I received the package which contained the K cups packed into a brown paper lunchbag [they did indicate that this is the way they are shipped], I was very excited to see what flavors were inside!  It felt like Christmas morning.  I was pleased to find that all of the K cups were intact and there were a wide variety of flavors, including seasonal and special edition flavors.  Yes, there are a few flavors that are in particular abundance, but they are the most commonly enjoyed flavors so I think it is reasonable.  There are a lot of Green Mountain flavors which I have no problem with because Green Mountain coffee is excellent.  I was happy when I saw 2 Timothy's Kahlua K cups because that's a flavor I've really been wanting to try!  Here's the tally:<br />Green Mountain Coffee French Vanilla 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Hazelnut Noisette 6<br />Timothy's Kahlua 2<br />Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry 4<br />Green Mountain Coffee Gingerbread 2<br />Gloria Jean's Mudslide 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Caramel Vanilla Cream 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Southern Pecan 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Mocha Nut Fudge 1<br />Total 35<br />That's right... I ordered the 34 count and they sent me 35.  The 35 count is $2.12 more than the 34 count on Amazon, so this decision definitely paid off!  That was generous, or perhaps clumsy of the sellers.  Either way, I will take this in a positive light.  Overall it was a good purchase!
1895	4	We recently got this, which seemed great because prior to this we purchased what we had thought to be  paragon popcorn  sold by amazon and we got this popcorn called  snappy  which really sucked because there were so many hulls, that we decided to buy this after reading the reviews.<br />upside: hardly any hulls<br />downside: the popcorn is very small, and not as tender as I would have thought it to be since the kernels are so small.<br />Overall, this popcorn is better than the one purchased before but I would probably look for something else.
1896	2	The taste, packaging was off in almost every way.<br /><br />The taste, packaging was off in almost every way.<br /><br />The taste, packaging was off in almost every way.<br /><br />The taste, packaging was off in almost every way.
1897	2	The package is 12 packages of 6 Pouches.  In each pouch, there is two bars.  But who cares how many bars in each pouch?  The weigh of each pocuch matters, but not how manufacturer package the each pouch.  If manufaturer decides to package each pouch with 8 small tiny bars, it does not make the package more valuable.  In short, I thought it is 12 x 12 snacks for me, which is good price.  It ended up 12 X 6 snacks for me, which is not so good price.  I can buy the same product at local stores cheaper and at smaller quarntity.  Why shall I order online and buy large quantity if there is no saving?  Disappointed.
1898	5	My kids enjoy The Cocktail Pepsticks  so iI buy them and send them to my kids<br /><br />Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pepperoni (2.8-Pound) Sticks, 45-Count Bag
1899	5	we absolutely love this creamy, melt in your mouth dark chocolate and have a few ounces every night. It isn't bitter but not very sweetIt's difficult to find in the stores around here but worth ordering online
1900	5	I remember this tea in the grocery stores when I was a child (it has the same or similar packaging), and it disappeared, however, browsing for teas on Amazon I came across this and when it was delivered into my hands I was astonished.  It's the best tea ever and seems to have been made for milk and honey.  It's rich, not bitter at all, and very satisfying - I love it!
1901	5	My dogs love these and I feel great about feeding them because they are such high quality.
1902	1	I am a mixed woman and have very coarse curly hair with frizz that is out of control without oils. This oil had no instructions so I applied it as my other oil products are applied. This left my hair oily and heavy with a thick perfume-y smell that lingered way too long. This company would do well to include real instructions and kill that fragrance as I can't imagine anyone would want to smell like that.
1903	2	I find most of the Senseo coffee products to be tasteless, maybe watered down, but not full-bodied or delicious.  I have tried several different Senseo varieties, but none are noteworthy and I wouldn't recommend any of them.  I am going to try other pod brands.
1904	5	My husband and I were served Olio Taibi  Biancolilla  at a dinner party tonight with rustic bread and fresh tomatoes - in a word...Amazing.  This olive oil is flavorful, yet smooth and delicate.  Contrary to the review above, I think Biancolilla would be fantastic in salad dressings and great for bread dipping.  I look forward to giving bottles as gifts this holiday season!
1905	1	I bought this water because it was cheap.  But let me tell you something, never buy cheap water.  This was literally the worst tasting water I have ever drunk.  It tastes similar to the garbage juice from my grand parent's trailer park waste runoff.  I worked in the septic tank cleaning business for most of my professional life, and a significant part of my job is to clean home septic tanks.  One of the most loathsome parts of my job is the scrubbing of the septic residue that accumulates on the bottom of the tank.  In our business, we call this  poop cheese .  Now I've been retired for many years, but upon opening the bottle of this rank liquid and bringing it to my lips, I remembered ever so vividly the horrors of poop cheese. I almost went into shock and passed out.  I soon regained consciousness, but it was an ordeal I would never wish upon anyone else.  Please avoid this foul-smelling concoction they call water, because it tastes like poop cheese.
1906	3	After my first few gulps I thought it tasted decent.  However, after half a can it started to take on a strange and somewhat unpleasant taste.  I still couldn't tell you what the flavor was.  Some sort of  fruit punch .  It does do what it says it is supposed to do which is give you an energy pick up.  I have tried a bunch of different energy drinks from various companies and they are all pretty similar.  Lots of caffeine, Vit B, guarana, and similar ingredients.  There effectiveness depends on individuals' resistance to these stimulants.  I drink several cups of coffee and/or energy drinks a day so the effects are there but minimal compared to my wife who is smaller and will only have an occasional cup of tea or coffee.  She drinks one of these and is bouncing off the walls.  For me it comes down to taste and I am not a fan of this flavor.  I would also choose a no- or low-calories version.
1907	5	Margarita, my 15 year old Scottish Fold, has always been a picky eater, but it's gotten much worse in the last couple years. She's practically skin and bones now. I've tried every kind of natural cat food on the market (I won't feed my animals the major brands) and this is her absolute favorite. Besides Hill's Prescription A/D, it's the only one she will eat after it's been in the refrigerator.
1908	5	OMG! The first bite I had I am hooked addicted to those cookies forever. If you eat Oreo then you have this cookie, I bet you'll buy this Late July product from now on. What a difference! I totally love the dark chocolate taste in my mouth. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, it's  rich  though. One pack is just right. I tried to eat 2 packs at one time, then it ended up too much for me. They were over-killing my taste buds. My 15 months toddler likes it too. But only for a little little piece, otherwise, it's too much. I am so happy that I try Late July's products. They are so GOOD!
1909	5	Wow - great Hummus, much better than one could expect from a dry-powder. Once you spice it up a bit with some red paprika, a bit of parsley and some cumin - its nearly the best Hummus I have ever had - and I had Hummus at the best places in Israel and New York City.
1910	5	My husband and I really use our Keurig, but storing all the boxes / K-cups  WAS  a real pain. Until we got this Pod Drawer. Freed up so much counter / cabinet space along with being super organized and stylish. We love it!!
1911	5	Came very quickly.  Great taste, consistency and such a treat for those who cannot have gluten.  I would definitely recommend this product.
1912	5	When I saw commercials and saw ads for Scalp & hair therapy volumizing root boost shampoo and conditioner, I thought - scalp soap? What will they come up with next?  I used the nourishing daily conditioner, I have thin hair that is fairly long, with no body and in the winter months my hair is SO dry. I have tried every conditioning product out there, cheap and expensive so I thought I would try this.  First, I LOVE the smell of this conditioner, and after you use it you can smell the great scent all day.  I didn't notice any root boost but it did condition my hair so that it looked shiny and not all dried out and frazzled.  I even used some as a leave in conditioner after I washed my hair on the very tips and it worked great. I would recommend this conditioner and will use it again.
1913	2	Full disclosure I am a do it yourself popcorn newb.  Made this in a wok with canola oil (no fancy machine).  Not what I was expecting for the fancy description and price.  Kernels popped up a lot smaller than I was expecting.  A bit tougher chew than I was expecting.  Maybe I'm just a newb but I prefer the supermarket bought Orville to this stuff (and so does my family).
1914	4	Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx
1915	5	I enjoy a cup, or thermos, of Caffix as a substitute for coffee. It contains no caffeine, and tastes mellower than coffee. You can drink it any time of the day or night. It is a grain-based beverage manufactured in Poland, and I highly recommend it for everyone who wants to relax and put their feet up on the caffix table. I have purchased it twice by the case, and will continue to.<br />I still enjoy a cup of regular decaf coffee or two each day, but for those in the Amazon crowd who want to cut down or cut out caffeine, then try this beverage.
1916	1	Based on the positive reviews and the organic certification I gave this a try. The taste is very sweet, which from the reviews, I expected. The texture is rubbery or plastic like, not at all like the real jerky I used to get in the south out of the jars in the truck stops. It may be organic, but it tastes like organic rubber to me.
1917	5	As a fan of the  After Dinner Linda's Lollies  I thought I'd start a new adventure and try 48 exciting flavors. These are perfect for every occasion and especially if you crave a wide range of flavors, but don't have time to always make Coconut Cr&egrave;me Pie or run to the store for Root Beer.<br /><br />Some of the flavors in this delicious 48-count box (mine arrived in a plastic bag) include: Watermelon, Buttered Popcorn, Green Apple, Caramel, Spearmint, Fruit Punch, Cotton Candy, English Toffee, Apple Cinnamon, Root Beer, Red Hot Cinnamon, Pink Lemonade, Pineapple, Peppermint (perfect), Blueberry, Wild Cherry, Milk Chocolate, Strawberry, Raspberry, Pink Grapefruit, Vanilla (so creamy), Limeade, Root Beer Float, Lemon Meringue Pie, Orangeade, Tutti-Fruity (cute and fun), Peanut Butter, Banana, Lemon Lime, Cherry Cheesecake, Butterscotch, German Chocolate Cake, Licorice, Chocolate Covered Banana, Concord Grape, Chocolate Marshmallow Sundae, Bubble Gum, Cinnamon (deliciously spicy), Pina Colada and Peach.<br /><br />Sound delicious? They are all dreamy sweet and smooth and taste delicious. One of the lollipops actually has coconut in it, so that is the only one I've noticed so far that had an interesting texture. I'd love to be able to buy a bag of any specific flavor - because you may notice you have favorites!<br /><br />A lollipop for every mood and occasion! Also try the Dessert and After Dinner varieties to get the full range of flavors.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, enjoying Banana Cr&egrave;me Pie
1918	5	My pup has food allergies -- quite a few of them. This salmon treat so far agrees with him. AND he loves the flavor.  Try these, you can't go wrong.
1919	5	These are the only chocolate-covered pretzels i've had and will be the only ones I will ever taste. These are the best snack treats around. You just can't eat one bag!
1920	5	Excellent product.  Long lasting hard candy, sugar free, great taste without that funny after taste of other sugar free candies.
1921	5	I love this coffee!  I use it on the keurig machine on the larger cup size and it makes a very mild and tasty cup of coffee.
1922	5	I just got my keurig so I bought this to try different flavors. This is a great way to test out what kinds you like. I would recommend it for anyone new to k cups.
1923	5	My 6 year old cardigan welsh corgi was originally on Eukanuba, which was recommended by our vet. But she had dry skin, a dull coat and not as much energy as a dog her age should have. She also tended to become a bit overweight on it.<br /><br />Based on a recommendation from a corgi breeder & my own research into the premium brands, I decided to try Orijen. What a difference! Her coat is now quite shiny and healthy looking. No more dry skin. Lots of energy, and she has lost a bit of weight & looks more muscular & healthy overall.<br /><br />She also loves the taste - no problem getting her to eat it. But feed according to how your dog looks, not how much it says on the bag. This is high protein stuff & your dog will gain weight if you feed according to package directions. My 25lb corgi (yes, she's a bit on the petite side), gets only 1/2 cup twice a day.<br /><br />No, the initial purchase price is NOT cheap. But because we feed so much less (no grains or fillers), a bag lasts just as long as what we were spending on Eukanuba. FYI - I just got a bag of their 6 fish food to try & she is wild over it.
1924	5	I just started Weight Watchers and realized that I was drinking a LOT of points by putting flavored creamers into my coffee each morning. So, I found another solution to have a 0 point coffee. Instead of flavored creamer, I use Coffee-Mate Fat Free Original (only 2 tbsp per cup, no more than 4 tbsp a day), plus one of these Splenda Vanilla packets. It turns my 2 point cup of coffee into 0 points, without losing much of the flavor I previously enjoyed. Great product! I wish more grocery stores carried it.
1925	1	I was thinking of buying from here but then I thought of checking out the price in Walmart or Walgreens first.<br />Indeed, the price in Walgreens is half of the price here. As of this writing, the Amazon price is $10.69, while the Walgreens price is only $5.00 for a pack of 8.
1926	1	I look forward to buying these every year and what a let down this years shipment was.These make a very weak cup of coffee with just a faint hint of pumpkin spice. Shame on you Green Mountain. Not up to the standards i thought your company had.
1927	3	So, the nutritional properties of Beneful are there for you to decide of your own volition, but as for a dog food my dogs like, this is it. I mixed it with Taste of the Wild which is grain free (and the mixture might be seen as sacrilege for the purists), but the dogs enjoyed it solo and in the mixture. I do notice they eat it by color though. The red kibble bits go first. Actually one dog loves the red kibble bits so much she dumps the whole bowl to get the red ones. Then goes the green, and finally the brown bits. Not sure what that is about, but it seems to be pretty standard by now. She actually started to growl when the other dogs came to eat before she was done with the red bits.<br /><br />The bag is easy to open and can be zipped closed, which I appreciate. The kibble size is relatively small, so for my mini doxies, it is pretty perfect. My sister's yellow lab came by, though, and I am fairly certain he didn't even have to chew- just inhaled and the bowl was empty. So I think this food is fine, but nutritionally questionable...
1928	1	I review beverages for a living, and wanted an alternative to caffine, decided to go this route, being a huge fan of teas, especially brown rice Japanese teas, this provides no mental clarity, no alert aid, nothing.  I was able to drink a cup with husband before a long treck with the dogs, and I wanted to take a nap....what a waste of 20 bucks, the advertisement is misleading and I truly believe it is cheap green tea in a simple green bag with a label you can have made at any printer to say organic coca....Amazon will be hearing from me after I contacted the seller and they said that it was opened so no return....how else are we going to know if a product is worthless...9.00 for the product and 9.00 for shipping for an ounce of green tea, what a joke...
1929	2	I have a Keurig B60 and have used it with a variety of coffee 'k cups' for several months now.  I was a little disappointed in the Tully French Roast.<br /><br />Now let me quantify that I  I tend to like my coffee  light and sweet .  I also find French Roasts to typically be among my least favorite types of coffee.<br /><br />I do sometimes opt for a bold cup of java.  However, I find the Tully French Roast to be more bitter than bold.  I've tired different cup size setting on the Keurig, but the Tully French Roast keeps resulting in a bitter cup of coffee.  It really had a burnt taste to it.<br /><br />I went so far as to run the same k cup through the Keurig twice to see if the Tully coffee was simply too bold for my taste.  I realize k cups are not intended for re-use but I was trying to figure out if the coffee was just too bold for my taste or really just bitter.<br /><br />SEE TIP AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW.<br /><br />While the second cup of coffee was on the weak side, it was still drinkable....however, just like the first, it was bitter.<br /><br />Where the Keurig is concerned I have found the best bold cups to be the Newman's Own Organic  Extra Bold  and the Emeril's  Big Easy Bold .<br /><br />Again, while not a huge fan of French Roast, I liked the Timothy's World  French Roast ; that brand is what you would expect, a nice cup of bold coffee.  The Tully's - just bitter.<br /><br />TIP:  While you probably don't want to reuse k cups as a regular practice, it does not hurt the machine, so if you like your coffee mild or want to cut down on costs, here is what you do.  Brew a cup of coffee using the k cup of your choice.  Then, go through the brewing process again: simply leave the used k cup in and lift and reclose the handle when the unit displayed 'Ready To Brew'.  This is best done with the small cup setting, otherwise your coffee will not be mild, but just plain weak.
1930	5	If you like pink grapefruit, you will love this product! I am a huge pink grapefruit lover and I really didn't expect a lot when I decided to buy these and give them a try...THEY ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!<br /><br />They look like a grapefruit section, and they are coated with sugar. These are delicious and would go great at any party or just to have as a little treat!<br /><br />Other people have said that they are good in small doses, but I wouldn't want more than 5-6 pieces at a time anyway, or else I would weigh 600 pounds! These are perfect to have around for a little treat for the kids or friends. I will definitely purchase these again!
1931	3	I got some of the metallic Vietnamese taste in mine also.<br /><br />After that I wanted to try a better tuna and I found one.<br /><br />American Tuna <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IMG41Q >American Tuna MSC Certified Sustainably Caught Albacore Tuna, 6oz Can w/ Sea Salt, Caught & Canned in America (6 Pack)</a> has higher Omega 3 (more than twice as much), 5% less cholesterol, is MSC certified, BPA free packaging, low mercury, and is caught and processed in the USA.<br /><br />It also has less sodium and actually tastes like tuna too.
1932	1	This pizza dough was completely and utterly unusable, without the addition of more than a cup of spelt flour, which defeats the whole GF idea. Luckily we weren't going for GF, just Wheat-free, so I was able to salvage it and the taste was okay; wasn't really pizza dough... but for my son who hasn't had a pizza in two years it was acceptable. I will never use it again!
1933	5	The fruit came fast, fresh and delicious. We enjoyed the different types of fruit.
1934	3	I only drink green and white variety of tea (no fruit mixes), however this tea didn't have any taste and was slight improvement on having hot water.
1935	3	The toy got a lot of interest, but I eventually had to take it away because of the way my dogs chose to play with it. They would grab it by the rope and shake their heads to release this treats, subsequently beating walls (or worse, human legs) that were near them. It appeared to be sturdy, and probably would have been a good toy otherwise.
1936	5	I've had the hardest time finding Nestea instant tea that's not sweetened and no lemon. I grew up drinking plain ice tea, with nothing in it except ice. In the past several years, it's been getting harder and harder to find Instant Nestea with nothing in it. All our local stores stopped carrying it. Fortunately, Amazon still carries it. I just received my order with six jars !! I'm happy now :does happy dance::
1937	4	My dogs used to eat Innova and they always had runny poops.  I then switched to ProNature which improved their poops but it is 57 dollars for a 30 pound bag.  I tried this and still have great results but at 45 dollars for a 30 pound bag.  Amazon is too pricey for this dog food but i guess its because they have  free  shipping.  The ingredients are great and meat is a main ingredient as it should be.
1938	3	I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.
1939	5	at first i just bought this espresso b/c it was way cheaper than any other in town. but omg it is sooo tasty. it is as good as the espresso i had in paris. definitely a good buy no matter the price.
1940	5	I love the tasty, healthy munchies and they keep me from craving unhealthy chips. The spicy flavor and little crunch is a treat.
1941	3	Vitamin Squeeze flavors water and purports to give you vitamins and energy. I have tried a few of these water  enhancers  and I don't really like them that much. But I actually liked the Vitamin Squeeze. It's not my favorite thing, but it is not that bad. The flavor is fruit punch-like. It has a bit of a chemical aftertaste but it doesn't linger. I do not feel any noticeable burst of energy (not even a little bit). But, as water enhancers go, it is not that bad.
1942	5	I was raised in Minnesota where ice cream is so heavy with cream you can hardy lift a scoop.<br /><br />So a soda fountain malt of the past was fantastic.<br /><br />Use this stuff in your home blender with ice cream and milk plus some whipped cream -- and you trip back to the taste of the 40s.<br /><br />It's fattening but worth it.<br /><br />Powers in LA.
1943	1	The order took 29 days to get to Hawaii.  When it finally got here, it was packed in a flimsy box. The boc itself had grease all over it. When I opened, there was no packing material and everyone of the 8 bags was open from the bottom.  The chips were all over the box and they were stale because of the open bag and the time it took to ship. This is not a reflection of the chips which are normally great but don't order them from here.
1944	4	This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.
1945	2	The write up for Krave double Chocolate cereal sounded so good, I just had to give it a try.  Crispy multi grain outside, smooth chocolate inside, good source of fiber (3 grams) and low sodium--what's not to like?  A lot.  Let's start with the deceptive advertising on the front of the box.  There is nothing smooth and chocolatey inside the cereal.  My daughter and I ate these without milk, and there was absolutely NOTHING in the center of the cereal but air.  The photo on the front of the box is completely photo shopped.  If by chance we came across one or two pieces with anything in the center, it was gritty and crumbly, but definitely not smooth.  As for the taste, it has a very fake chocolate taste and the cereal itself dissolves in your mouth with one bite, leaving a gummy paste on your teeth.  The cereal literally stuck to my teeth--which is something I have never experienced with any other cereal.  While I commend Kellogg's for making a cereal (that should appeal to kids) with added fiber, whole grain wheat flour, and whole grain oat flour, there is not much to like about the taste of the cereal.  This will be my first and last box.  If you are craving chocolate in your cereal, and looking for a little nutritional value to boot, I would stick with <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X8T8DK >Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Chocolate Cereal, 15.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.  These do not turn to instant mush in milk and taste extremely good.
1946	5	My mom & I didn't know where to find almond butter, we heard about it. I knew I'd find it on Amazon.com. Barney's is the best so far for us. Thank you.
1947	3	Although my kids like this juice, I was disappointed to discover it's only 66% juice. It's also 10g sugar per box.
1948	5	My son LOVES the Ella's kitchen line of organic baby foods. By far his favorite has to be the Spinach, Apple and Rutabaga. I'm always tasting his foods before I give it to him and this is something I would eat! My son was EBF until 6 months, and I started out making his own organic baby food, but working full time and being a single mom it was taking up too much time that I could be spending with my son. I researched the Ella's kitchen organic baby food and decided to try it out, and we haven't found a kind he dislikes! This has made feeding time a joy for both of us.
1949	5	Great coffee, great price, fast shipping. Can't always find my coffee in the grocery store and when I do it is only 1 or 2 boxes there and it's only boxes of 18 and I am always running out.  I can order and have it here in a couple days and at a cheaper price than I am paying in the stores.  Now I have my coffee anytime I want it.
1950	4	This is a great Coffee/Tea/Hot Water Maker. It Heats the water very quickly, brews very quickly, and its very easy to clean. The only problem I have with it is the price of the  K-Cups . At Sams Club you can buy them in packs of 80 for $36.  This is a great deal compared to Walmart (Which was a pack of 16 for $12.)but that's still $0.45 per cup. If you were to drink 1 cup of coffee every day, for a year, it would cost you about $165. On the other hand, the same amount of Folgers canned coffee would cost you about $10.6 per year at $0.2 per 6 ounce serving. And of course that would be even less if you went with an off brand coffee. So overall the Keurig is a good machine, and a good deal if you use the reusable filter. This is what I will be using most of the time because of the price of k-cups. Until they sell 1800 k -cups for $36 (the price of 80 cups at sam's) they just aren't worth it. So If you decide to buy this machine I DEFINITELY recommend the reusable k cup.
1951	1	I ordered this expecting it to be the sweet, salty, and savory combination that everyone knows and loves as kettle corn.  Unfortunately, the actual product was far from that.  We use a whirly pop exclusively to pop our popcorn for the family, and figured we would give this product a try.  It was a horrible result that was like a gooey version of cracker jacks, without the sweet savory flavor.  What a total waste!
1952	5	This is an awesome selection of decaf coffees!  I can't wait to try them all.  If you are looking for variety or a way to try the many different flavors of k cups, this is for you.  Will definitely purchase again.
1953	5	I have had a terrible time finding a dog food that works for 2 very different dogs...one makes one flake and have dry skin, the other makes the other one sick to the stomach, etc.  I wanted to keep their food as high quality as I can to ensure good health - Natural Balance is the answer for us.  I haven't had any issues with damaged cans at all.  We switch them between different flavors - but liver always seems to be their favorite.  We also give them <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFNFG >Natural Balance Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Limited Ingredient Diet Small Bites Duck and Potato Formula, 12.5 Pound Bag</a>.  Love it and they've been on this for over 2 years now with great health!
1954	5	We love this agave nectar.  The taste is like something between honey and syrup and it has a very low glycemic index so no problems with blood sugar issues.<br />The best price I have found as well!  Thanks
1955	5	I've tried many mosquito repellents over the years.  Mosquitos really like my fresh skin.  All sorts of products over the years failed, and in fact, many times I believed the repellents were actually BRINGING the nasty bugs in my direction.  Not so with any kind of Cutter mosquito repellent.  Not only does it take the itch away immediately, and not only do mosquitos avoid you the second you apply some on your skin, but the next day you might wake up to find that the bites you had from the night before have been completely healed.  No kidding.  Great, great product.  Highly recommended.
1956	5	The package was even larger than I expected!  The bag is roughly 1'x1.5'x0.5' and contained at least 20 10-inch rawhide rolls.  It has a printed expiration date on the bag (2 years from the time I purchased them, which is far more than adequate for my heavy chewer).  According to the information printed on the product, the rolls are 100% beefhide and made in Paraguay.<br /><br />So far my 3 year old 25lb terrier mix is crazy about them. She can go through one roll in a few hours, but I usually let her have half of one every few days.
1957	5	The chocolate is fantastic.  I just mix a scoop with a mashed banana and eat straight from the bowl.  Yummm
1958	5	This oatmeal and all McCann's oatmeal is great.  It is creamier and larger packets than Quaker.  I used to buy this item at my grocery store but they stopped stocking it.
1959	3	These are a staple on my grocery list from Amazon (I get two boxes a month on the  Subscribe and Save  program, and often have to  send next shipment now  because I share them with friends at work).  However, I've become alarmed when I open the newer boxes / packages- the bars are at least an inch shorter than they used to be.<br /><br />I thought maybe I had a few from the  end of the roll  or something, but it seems rather consistent now.  The cellophane wrapper is the same size, but the bars are missing at least a full bite of what the bars used to be.  And the prices keep going up.  I like these, but at some point the decreased  value  will get to a point where I'll find something else to snack on.
1960	1	I've been researching Orgain online trying to figure out what happened considering I used to live on it but now can no longer even FIND it. Like many of the other reviews mention - I lived on this stuff for breakfast and would purchase it by the case for months. I immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned (I always ordered the chocolate flavor) and agree the new ingredient flavor change was NOT for the better. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Then I suddenly realized that Orgain was no longer available at ALL in my local Whole Foods where I used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store. I then noticed that my 'subscribe & save' case shipping from Amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on-going subscription. I mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to Orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store, Rainbow Grocery, has also quit selling it. I assumed that Orgain went out of business but I am still finding it online here at Amazon (just no longer with subscribe & save option) - and the official website appears to be up and running (with Whole Foods still quite confusingly being listed as a retail provider). I checked another Whole Foods retail store in another city and they, too, have quit selling this product which leads me to believe that Whole Foods has backed out entirely.<br /><br />Super frustrated and really disappointed on all counts. I am actively seeking, like other customers, a new replacement. I tried Muscle Milk the other day -- GROSS!
1961	3	This  grape  taste is ok - just OK or acceptable, or  will do in a pinch if I have to sacrifice some taste because I want no calories.  The cherry flavor, however, is the bomb.
1962	3	I got this because I was looking for a great coffee to make at work without a coffee machine or spending $2 on a cup.  Unfortunately I will have to keep searching.<br /><br />This smells really nice, but is very weak coffee.
1963	5	I am poor but love earl grey tea and of all the types of earl grey this one is by far my favorite not only because of price but because of flavor.<br /><br />I always end up buying this at the grocery store whenever I can. Since coffee makes me feel ill and energy drinks are costly black tea is my primary source of daily caffeine. Getting one measly 30-pack of this tea lasts me a very short time. I practically jumped for joy when I found this was available not only in bulk, but I can subscribe for a regular shipment every 3 months! Lets hope it lasts more than 3 months!
1964	5	These are the best tasting protein bars i've ever eaten. the taste sweet but only have 5 grams of sugar. they don't have that bad chemically tasting sweetness that alot of low sugar foods have.  they only have 200 calories whereas most of the protein bars i've tried have over 300 calories.  i've been trying to lose weight and starting eat one of these bars a day to try and keep myself from eating candy bars. they definitly satisfy my craving for sweets. i've lost 4 lbs in the past few weeks so at least i know they aren't preventing me from losing weight like my daily candy bar fix was.  also the carb amount is fairly low in these bars. i'm hooked on them and will plan to keep buying them in bulk.
1965	5	The Glucerna chocolate caramel snack bar is great. I use it as a snack between meals and it helps me to keep my blood sugar under control.
1966	5	I used these for the first time this summer hiking the Grand Canyon and other places out west, we took down bottled sport drink and these tablets to save weight. At home I tried them and thought they taste like watered down grape jello, but not bad. On the trip I was amazed, sports drinks got hot and tasted gross and sticky, made you feel bloated yet still thirsty. These little tabs cover the taste of water, didn't make your mouth feel gross and you could feel the pick up it gave you. Completely satisfied with the product and willing to try other flavors. It was easy to use, pop them in your bottle and they fizz away, a quick shake and your ready to go. Don't pop them in your mouth, as a buddy of mine did thinking thats how you used them, he gagged his way through for quite a while, I still laugh at the memory.
1967	5	Love these chips. They taste great and I love knowing I'm getting in my grains while eating something that tastes good.
1968	5	This is absolutely delicious.  It's good for you, has 72% cacao, and I appreciate that they contribute to endangered species conservation.
1969	5	Purchase this for my spanish rice recipes.  It is also great for my clams, mussels and seafood recipes.  You only need a very small quatity to add to the taste.  It is a good quality product and will not hesitate to purchase it again.
1970	5	These yummy pizza crusts make it possible for me to fully, and happily participate in my family's make-your-own pizza nights! I am gluten and dairy-free and, with these tasty crusts, I can add olive oil, garlic, diced tomatoes or tomato sauce, shrimp, veggies, whatever. My kids use the (more affordable) regular pizza crusts that, but these ones are all mine!
1971	4	I drink a lot of hoji cha (almost every day) and I enjoy this tea. It is a bit strong with sort of a grainy flavor, but still good. I recommend trying a dual brewing to see if you like it. 20-30 seconds of the tea bag brewed in hot water to bring out some body and then about 10 minutes of same tea bag infused in cold water to bring out the sweetness. A half a cup of each temperate water. Then combine the two. Works fairly well.
1972	4	As others reviewers have mentioned, these really stink.  However, the dog seems to like them and the odor is good for training.  Be careful if you bring these to the dog park.  You'll quickly develop a flock of fans!
1973	3	I received one 1.5 liter bottle of this water from the Amazon Vine program and my husband is the one who drank it. He took it to work with him one day and saved it in the fridge to drink on his hour long commute back home in the afternoon. He said it was cool and refreshing like water normally is but that he didn't notice any kind of difference between it and any other bottled water brands he'd tried. He said the size of the 1.5 liter bottle was good in that it was plenty to drink but bad because it wouldn't fit into any of his car's cup holders. He said it would have been a good size to keep at his desk during his work day. But considering the rather high price of this water, I don't think we'll be buying any of it. I know there are a lot of claims made regarding the benefit of this specific brand relating to its pH, but I think all that might just be bogus. I don't know of any reason to choose this brand of bottled water over any other.
1974	5	We have enjoyed Jet Fuel Dark Roast many times.  We love the full flavor and the aroma is very coffee like, kind of along the lines of a strong expresso.  The flavor is earthy, strong and has a full flavor like you would expect from a dark roast.  It is not overbearing as far as the flavor and I find it is good with many different creamers.  The smell is what you notice first but the taste is something you can't forget.  If you like strong coffee that is rich and aromatic then try Jet Fuel, you will not be disappointed.
1975	5	If a grand Manhattan, on a cold winter night, before the fireplace, -- is your thing, make it grand with an Italian Cherry from Luxardo.  The best.  Two oz. Dickel.  One oz. Red Vermouth.  Teaspoon Luxardo juice.  One cherry.  Shake with ice and drink straight from Martini glass.  It doesn't get any better than this.
1976	5	Good stuff. Tastes pretty good, I mix with crystal light fruit punch. You have to mix it pretty well to make sure it is all dissolved.
1977	5	My cat has been having some health problems, and I have to make sure he eats so he can take his medicine.  After spending the day at the vets, he had no interest in food.  I sprinkled Foodie Cat on his wet food and it was instant...he chowed it all down.  I've also used it to get him to ingest a crushed up pill that I had put on top of his food.<br /><br />It works great!  Cats are crazy for it.<br /><br />Thank you Foodie Cat!
1978	4	As a nursing mom, I can't drink caffeine (it makes my baby fussy), and I'm getting REALLY sick of Sprite and Sierra Mist. So I was thrilled to try the Switch carbonated juices -- sometimes you just want something fizzy!<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor is indeed delicious (though, as some reviewers have noted, there is a strong apple flavor -- apple juice is the first ingredient), but I was shocked to see 33g of sugar on the label. That's a LOT of sugar for an 8.3-ounce can! Ounce for ounce, it's more sugar than Sierra Mist, which really surprised me.<br /><br />So I'll definitely drink this again, but unfortunately, the amount of sugar and the relative lack of nutrients in apple juice don't make it a wildly better choice than pop.
1979	5	These are very light yet sturdy at the same time--great for appetizers and the price is very good. To my surprise none were broken-they are very well packaged in sets of 12. They came very quickly and I will be ordering more for the next holiday.
1980	5	Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!
1981	5	My 7 year old Catahoula has been eating Wellness Super 5  Mix for 2 - 3 years and is thriving on it.  Her coat is beautiful and her stomach  activity  is nice and normal.  She gets 3/4 cup twice a day and a few treats during the day and she appears to be a happy camper.  She cleans her bowl at each meal and would probably eat many, many cups of this dry food ---if I offered it!
1982	5	Very good, wish they would make a german style rye bread mix.<br />Yeast packet works every time.
1983	5	This is so delicious - so easy to keep in your pocket or purse to save your diet. I keep tons at work for meetings that happen when people are starving - these are a godsend.  I think they are one point with wwatchers.
1984	5	a most wonderful blend, had drunk it for years while traveling in the far east and wondered why it is not available in the US stores.  Thank God for amazon, I buy 6 boxes at a time.  Never tire of the taste, great with sugar or artificial sweeteners
1985	5	This makes a very satisfying cup or pot of tea. It's smooth without being weak, and is a lovely pick-me-up as well as whatever the opposite of that is -- a settle-me-downer? Anyway, highly recommended.
1986	2	I have a rescued greyhound and he was doing great on Canidae until we got our last order just last month.  Now he's a mess digestively.  I'm on an email discussion group for greyhounds and have seen lots of complaints as well as confirmation that the formula has changed.  Definitely not working for my dog anymore.  Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for.  I know everyone's hurting financially, but I think in this case the dogs got sold down the river for a few bucks.  Disappointing.
1987	5	I order two of these little trees and they came in great condition, mine looks even better than the one in the picture. Really happy with my bonsai tree.
1988	5	as early as i can remember when going to italy, everyone i would visit would be cooking on the stove a pot of Lavazza Creme e Gusto.<br /><br />I was tickled to see that i could start getting this through amazon's subscribe & save.  Best deal on the internet!<br /><br />knock on wood, i've been doing this for over a year and not 1 shipment has ever been messed up.  The only way i would recommend something different is if you have a pressure brewer.  Lavazza has a brew just for that.<br /><br />I know that the Lavazza Qualita Rossa is their higher  quality  roast but i just can't taste it.  I dont think its bad but not better than Creme & Creme is cheaper.<br /><br />I keep the open pack in the fridge & the sealed packs in the freezer.  No arguments from my local spanish family or friends who makes a mean cup of espresso.  using ice cold spring water helps too ;)<br /><br />i use Bialetti Moka Express stove top & electric pots to brew my espresso
1989	4	Was great to get the candy but was very hot and they melted!  They did firm back up so I still ate them....LOL
1990	5	I've tried a lot of coffee's... from Kona peaberry to Jamaican blue mountain,  and most of the African's and I have never found anything to rival this excellent blend's consistancy and kick.  Ive wasted alot of money on poorer quality coffee trying to find  The One  I am 100% in love with this blend and I can't wait to try the rest of the flavors, but Dead Man's Reach will my go-to morning kick start for a long time to come.
1991	4	I tried the salsa, cinnamon, and this chocolate flavor.  Of the three, I like chocolate best.  This snack does a pretty good job of being filling when you are hungry.  However, you should watch how much you eat and go by the serving size as they are somewhat calorie dense.  Of course, no more so than chips or something.  They contain all natural ingredients if that's important to you.  Bottom line, they taste good, are filling, are natural, but don't have an really appetizing appearance.
1992	5	I've loved this tea eversince Starbucks sold it in select stores. Now that they've stopped I needed to find it elsewhere. Please continue to sell Tazo Lotus Green Tea, as it is hard to find, and very much appreciated. Very quick and excellent shipping.<br />Thanks again!
1993	5	My 3 1/2 month old kitten Sadie just loves this food.  She has lots of energy and none of the bloat that other foods gave my other cats.  I would recommend this food for anyone with kittens.
1994	2	I love coconut juice but I don't love this. I should also mention that I love pina coladas too. Though I understand that pina coladas are made with coconut MILK and not coconut juice, I thought there would be some parallels.<br />First of all, this drink has a strange salty flavor. Secondly, it's not sweet. It SMELLS sweet and pineapple-y, but the flavors just don't coordinate with each other and don't match the smell.
1995	5	Aaah, nothing like good black tea!  Black tea, in addition to having a very pleasant flavor has many health properties.  It regulates your blood sugar; it is cardio-healthy; it inhibits cancer; it reverses clogging of the arteries; it has anti-oxidants; it is an anti-inflammatory and virus buster and it just plain tastes good.  The myriad of varieties of English teas are derived from black tea.  If you want good, affordable black tea, then you want this tea.
1996	5	I used to have to order this by mail from NYC.  Or buy it in person and carry it home (heavy).  Now it is so easy to order online.  The best honey in the world.  I guess the Greek bees are sweeter than ours here in the US
1997	5	I have a dog with what we believe is an allergy to chicken.  These are the best treats for her, she loves them and I searched and searched for the best price.  These are $16 in the pet stores! Found them for $8 using an Amazon provider.  She is happy chomping away on these while the other dogs eat chicken treats.
1998	5	Had 4 rescued Hairy Kids, cats :). Had another kitten show up on Aug. 22, now have 5. They like this food and I think it's one of the better ones after doing the research.
1999	5	If you like smokey, sweet, molasses based BBQ this is as close to heaven as you will get! I have found no better.
2000	5	These are extremely tasty, they remind me of a glazed donut. They can be a convenient & healthy meal replacement occasionally; as long as you eat them in addition to your daily fruits, veggies, whole grains, water, etc.
2001	4	I was in the mood for a peanut butter and chocolate treat, but not a peanut butter cup. Being hungry for sweets, I hurried in the store and down the cookie aisle and noticed  New  Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Cremes; just what the doctored ordered!  When arriving home, I tore into the package and tried a couple and, to my surprise, they were quite good!  They kind of remind me of the Girl Scout Peanut Butter Tagalongs. When first biting into the cookie, there is a very sweet peanut butter taste and then the chocolate seems to over-power it is some.  More peanut butter taste would be nice, but they did the trick for my sweet tooth.  A friend of mine tried one and didn't really care for the cookie, but we all have different taste.  :)
2002	1	These  pasta pick ups  are really gross.  My 16 month old, who loves pasta of any kind, would not touch these.  The texture is just not right.  The ravioli is mushy, and it does not have the look, feel, or taste of normal pasta.  I would have been better off buying a different brand of pre-made ravioli that I can cook by boiling it in water.
2003	5	My cat loves this.  Have to keep it on hand for his kong.  Makes his morning.  Great price, too. Thanks to Amazon.
2004	4	the product is great and the fast shipping (free 2nd day) is wonderful.  I was hoping to make this my routine purchase, but the price was increased next day!  From $30.99 to $40.99, a whopping 32% increase!  Now I will have to go to stores to get this....
2005	5	While traveling in New York we stopped at an Inn for dinner and decided to try this with our dinner. I was a very pleasant surprise. It really tasted like Raspberries. If you like Raspberries and bubbles, you will not be disappointed. Scale of 1 to 10 a big 10 +++
2006	5	These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet  Black Cherry  jelly beans are very good tasting and somewhat on the sweet side. The black cherry flavor is very natural tasting but because they are fairly sweet my family enjoys these more than I do.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous  Jelly Belly  jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E >David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />CFH
2007	5	My sister-in-law brought me a jar of this smooth, creamy,  delicately sweet chocolate spread on her recent visit from the UK.<br /><br />Cadbury's spreads like butter, the other leading chocolate/hazelnut spread  can tend to be a little thick and tear the bread and I am not a fan of the hazelnut; I'd rather have the pure chocolate.<br /><br />Chocolate does not get much purer than Cadbury.<br /><br />One of my favorites is as a late night snack is made up of a wheat sandwich thin, one side with peanut butter the other side with Cadbury's.  Yum.<br /><br />For me it is worth the price; we have a British shop 30 miles in the next town over.  It was $10.70 there and I burned 2 gallons gas in the trip to pick it up.<br /><br />It is a luxurious treat.  Hide it from the kids :-)
2008	4	My dogs love these to fill up their buddy toy.  My dogs can't eat all treats but I'm buying more of these, that pretty much sums it up.
2009	5	They have the best flavor and are so fresh. I order other flavors also with the same results. So Yummy!
2010	5	The mouth says,  How do I love thee, let me count the ways... <br />If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy.
2011	5	I received my Dawn Redwood a couple of days ago.  I don't think I got the same impression as others when I first saw my tree.  I ordered it early in the year so I am assuming it is just now starting to get its leaves for the spring.  My wife's first impression was that it looked like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.<br /><br />I love the bark on this tree and how it makes it look older.  The trunk of the tree and taper is probably about average.  From soil to the top of the tree it is 21 inches tall.  The color of the bark and the color of the leaves is really beautiful.  I am anxious for it to fill out.<br /><br />Overall it looks like it has some potential for a nice tree.
2012	5	This reasonably priced spice mix gives you the authentic Cincinnati chili flavor and the authentic recipe to cook it.  When using meat, I cook with ground bison because it's a free-range beast, but this is also a delicious spice blend for non-traditional dishes (beans, vegetables).  MMMM...enjoy!
2013	5	I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.
2014	5	Luv this all natural Zero calorie sugar subsitute!  I use it in my coffee, tea, ceral, on fruit and everything else I put sugar in or on.
2015	5	We used these for a St. Patrick's Day themed party. They arrived in good condition and tasted pretty good. Would definitely order again.
2016	5	I have ordered Blue Dog Bakery Biscuits for years.  You can get them in low fat, they are natural and my dogs love them.
2017	5	First I was shocked at the size.  A little bigger than advertised, actually . Second the quality of it was great - it didn't  stink  like some bones I've gotten in the past.  My dog is a little older now (10.5 years) so she doesn't go through bones as quickly as before, and this one lasted quite a while.  Very solid, no chips or sharp points to it and it doesn't snap apart like some more brittle bones have, either - it more or less grinds down with their chewing.  I highly recommend this product, and for only $5 you're getting more than you pay for in my opinion.
2018	5	Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for  pee  rewards and larger ones of another brand for  poo  rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!
2019	4	i did enjoy this product in my hair.<br /><br />usually i get too greasy or too watery.<br /><br />the product had a nice consistency and the smell was very pleasant.<br /><br />yet like with all products like this, it's difficult to get out of the bottle. My fingers get messed up and once you get to the middle it gets even more difficult.<br /><br />If someone could design a better way to get the product out that is like this, i would love to buy this product more.
2020	5	This company offers wonderful products, and Lemon Burst should be among their best.  Exceptional!
2021	4	We rate this right up with high er  quality sea salts. It has a strong flavor, but tastes clean. Far better than any typical table salt for sure. I'd rather buy this than kosher salt (we don't use regular iodized salt) for anything you add salt to at the table. For cooking, though, standard kosher salt is preferred by us.
2022	3	We've been purchasing direct from retail stores, either PetSmart or Felix & Oscar's in Springfield, VA.  The condition of the cans shipped was not as good as I would have hoped.  Several cans were dented in each shipment.  Quality of the cat food is very good; cost savings may outweigh the shipping issues and the convenience of not going to the pet store.
2023	3	Another Dr. Oz recommendation...he has talked about Goji berries and golden berry so when I saw this I thought it would be a good way to incorporate the two. It is not the greatest tasting mix so I put dried cranberries and pecans with it. I take it with me as a snack during a busy errand running day. It is a good product if you can live with the somewhat sour taste.
2024	3	I have to agree with my son ~ these weren't as good as the plain old vanilla gluten free bunnies. At all. The chocolate bunnies were so chalky tasting. Ick. We picked out all the vanilla ones and ate those. Unfortunately, they had ended up tasting a little like the chocolate ones. Sorry Annie's!
2025	5	This is WONDERFUL even if you hate green tea. I add two packets of sweetner and drink it hot in the morning. I have given tea bags to several of my friends and co-workers and even the ones who think green tea is gross LOVE IT!
2026	5	Expensive but worth every penny.  A little thin for a preserve but still<br />is a great spread and taste.  Plus it is good for you.
2027	3	These are not the typical Caesar salad croutons, but nevertheless, still very tasty.<br /><br />The ingredients:<br /><br />- Not overly salted so the herbs really contribute to the flavor.<br /><br />- The amount of garlic is OK, so your loved ones do not have to eat these croutons along with you to bear your presence :-)<br /><br />- No dubious  natural  flavors were used.<br /><br />- The package states  Product of Israel , so the herbs really seem to come from a Mediterranean climate.<br /><br />- The size of the croutons is on the smaller side so they can readily absorb the dressing. Very important for me, since I am usually a little bit in a hurry when I prepare my meals.<br /><br />On the obvious downside is the long transportation distance from the manufacturer to the US, which is usually a bit disturbing for consumers of organic products. I also couldn't find a  Best before...  info on the package.<br /><br />Overall still a nice crouton variety.
2028	5	This honey is SO GOOD! I'm not even kidding when I say that when I have a sweet tooth, I will literally take a spoon and eat a teaspoon of this and I'm satisfied. I use it in my tea, on my toast, bagels, this stuff rocks! I bought some for my Mom and she went nuts over it too. I tried Agave nectar and as it turns out, I'm allergic to it. I got itchy and dizzy and my heart felt like it was going to pound of of my chest! Stevia just left me with a bad aftertaste. YUCK! This honey is awesome, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Great alternative to sugar.
2029	2	First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion.  Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese.  They taste kinda weird.  It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings.
2030	2	I know what I am getting as far as product, taste, etc., love the PRIME, and always seem to run out of the very tiny containers sold at our (expensive) local grocer. I can't seem to find these at Sam's anymore in the BIG containers and gave Amazon a shot. I wanted to see what the 2 oz. size looked like to get an idea before purchasing but couldn't find a close match in our spice cupboard so I pulled the trigger. UGH! At the store today and I see the 2 oz. is the tiny one and about $2.50!! A rip off as each is about $5.00 here!
2031	4	I'm not much of a tea drinker, but I decided to give this a whirl.  I used my coffee pot to brew it and threw in 3 teabags.  I added some sugar and ice and had a fantastic glass of iced tea.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is supposed to be hot tea or what, not being a tea fan, but I really enjoyed the Blackberry flavoring with just a hint of vanilla.  You can really taste the rose hips so if you aren't a fan of that I would dodge this tea.<br /><br />I have to admit that the little silky bags really made me happy, and I'm not exactly sure why.<br /><br />My room mate love this tea as well and it has since been added to the grocery list.  I will be making much more of this in the future because it makes an excellent choice for before bed when I'm not in the mood for a glass of water but don't want to add caffeine to the insomniac arsenal.  Very flavorful, brightly colored and fun to drink, I recommend this for a step away from regular tea.
2032	5	This tea has great taste and may not need added sweetener depending on your taste. The bags are of high quality and do not leak. If your are used to purchasing tea bags from local nationwide chains you may be familiar with leaky bags that seem to always fall apart in your cup often requiring straining. This brand is different.<br /><br />The taste is mild yet soothing and you feel alert and ready to go right away. I will be purchasing more from this vendor.
2033	5	For the past two days every time I walk past my tin of Red Leaf Tea's Madagascar Vanilla Matcha, I have to stop and smell it. It really is an indescribable wonderful smell!<br />I have had this Matcha in Red Leaf's  2 in 1  option combined with Caramel Matcha and it was heaven. This time around I bought each of those flavors separately so I could use them individually or combined. This past weekend, my awesome daughter bought me a Magic Bullet blender because I have been so into making tea based drinks and smoothies etc. Already I have used this amazing flavored Madagascar Vanilla Matcha to make some super scrumptious smoothies. This morning I added it to a peach greek yogurt smoothie and it was delicious. Vanilla goes so well with so many fruits such as strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Or this Matcha is spectacular all by itself, hot or cold. This flavor Matcha remains my top favorite and I believe I will be reordering this probably every order I place with Red Leaf because you just can't go wrong with this one. (Perhaps I should give Red Leaf's French Vanilla Matcha a chance though!)<br />Besides tasting so yummy, one cup of Matcha tea is equivalent to ten cups of green tea, so the health rewards are astronomical!
2034	5	I have two very picky cats -- they like moist cat food, but not from cans!  The Gravy Sensations are their favorites.  Interestingly, one prefers the seafood pouches and the other chooses the chicken pouches.  It makes my life easier to have both types in one container -- no search in stores which often have only one or the other.
2035	2	finally bought some of this and i am not impressed. its weak and doesnt live up to thedescription on dilmah's website.<br />my favorite is their ceylon supreme, i like the Meda watte, but thats it. i am done with their specialty teas
2036	5	just what the DO ordered. just the thing for migraines when you don't or won't want to resort to heavy, addicting pharmacuticals. just pour over ice and sip. bingo, headache gone
2037	5	We first had these in Ireland, wow are these yummy! I have been buying them at Whole Foods at double the cost, this a great value! No artificial colors, flavors:) great with milk or hot coffee, tea.
2038	5	My dog (who is on a diet) loved these and I didn't feel so guilty giving him a treat.  They are good for large dogs as they are a healthy size, must be tasty as he gobbled them right up (and he's picky) and they are low calorie...what more could you want.
2039	1	These treats are so hard that I have to take a mallet out on a hard floor with a newspaper to break them up to give to my dog.  I would not buy them again.  My dog is a chewer, but these have no appeal to him unless I break them up first.  And he LOVES duck treats.
2040	5	I love this stuff. It is delicious. It is solid at room temperature but I prefer it in liquid form which I achieve by running the jar under hot water. I take 1 tbsp about 3-4 times a day and use this as a moisturizer after the shower. It tastes yummy but I did have to get used to the feeling that I was swallowing oil. My hubby had no problem w this and even joked it was so good that he could drink it with a straw. I have suffered w a systemic yeast infection for years which has caused numerous skin problems and a nasty white tongue. This has cleared that up in a week. The pimples I had on my arms and thighs are gone and so are my undereye dark circles. My nails are growing smoothly and my hair stopped falling out when I brush. I also started using it as a vaginal moisturizer and I am extremely pleased with the results. I also noticed how it helped with my cold. My symptoms were mild whereas everyone else had a more severe reaction. It also helped with my cracking feet and my pinky toe, which has been blackened forever, is returning to normal. I love using it on the kids lips because I know when they lick it off it's not harmful. My hubby started taking it as well when he saw how I benefited and he loves the natural burst of energy he gets after. My daughter finally tried some and now loves it on her madelines in the morning. I cant say enough wonderful things about this product. I feel like a brand new person. I wish doctors knew more to recommend this instead of blaming loss of energy and skin problems on aging. This is healthy for you, gives you energy, aids in weight loss and kills bacterias, yeasts and fungus. First magazine just wrote an article on the benefits of adding coconut oil to your diet in their January issue. It's so good that I'm going to subscribe to it.<br />UPDATE: I still LOVE this product and use it daily. I've found it makes the best pancakes when you grease the griddle w some. It is an excellent wood cleaner and the only way I clean wood, now. I also make a lip scrub w a drop of coconut oil in the palm of my kids' hands and a pinch of sugar. They love how yummy it is, I don't worry if they get it in their mouths, and they no longer have dry, cracking winter lips. My youngest has been using it nightly, after her bath, and the excema that plagues her legs, hasn't returned w the dry, cold air. This has become one of the most used products in my home.
2041	5	This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it  worked  because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus.
2042	5	First of all, I'm not gluten intolerant, but I saw this mix in the store and was  curious.  WOW, this bread is amazingly good!  I can only imagine those who do have an intolerance what a blessing this would be!  It's simply a great product, and tastes very good, and has a great texture.  Something I've notice people say about other gluten-free breads is how they fall apart, and this bread doesn't seem to have that problem.  My husband (who is a hard sell) and kids loved it too!  I've decided to buy more through Amazon's Subscribe & Save service, since it's quite a bit  cheaper than what I would have to pay in the store.  It's a great product, very easy to use and versatile for other recipes too, which I plan to try very soon.  I also love Pamela's Pancake Mix (it tastes and looks like regular pancakes--you wouldn't guess it was gluten-free) & Namaste Spice Cake mix (also gluten-free) is very yummy!
2043	4	I've bought other falafel mixes and this one is decent, but not the best.  Most mixes take about 15 minutes to thicken after water is added.  This one takes at least 30 minutes.  Even then, it might not be thick enough.  I have broiled the falafels rather than deep frying, so the fact that they are  wetter  than most falafels is actually a good thing since they don't get dried out.  The falafels do taste great.
2044	5	This is a great habanero sauce, with really good flavor and a nice level of heat. It's not just hot for hot's sake. There are plenty of much more fiery sauces for true capsaicin fanatics and macho guys trying to impress party-goers. But don't underestimate the kick. If you think Tabasco Sauce (also a favorite for Cajun) is hot, be careful with El Yucateco. I love this stuff!
2045	5	I received this item with several other items - it was carefully packed in an individual, padded box within the larger parcel Amazon delivered.  While I prefer vanilla bean paste as a general rule, extract is much more economical and this is fairly good quality product with a standard alcohol base.  The value is hard to beat.
2046	4	When first unwrapping the 11 oz. Package of Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee, the aroma may bring about the anticipation of what to expect from this brand.  And after preparing two or more teaspoons, depending on one's preference, and hearing the coffee maker percolate and finally smelling the freshly made pot of coffee made and taking the first sip, one will experience Melitta as an alternative to other gourmet coffees.  With its mild and not as strong taste as a regular cup of Starbuck's, coffee drinkers familiar with Folgers' Gourmet Selections may find this brand as comparable.  Indeed, a coffee worth trying.
2047	5	These noodles are great!  The only thing missing was the wonderful atmosphere of the country!
2048	5	We get these thruogh subscribe and save and they are always on time and my husband takes these for his snack when he works out
2049	5	We have been getting these Organic Hemp Seeds on Auto-Ship.  They are fantastic and such a good deal.  Been eating them on salads mostly.  We have been on a mostly raw food diet.  Perfect addition!
2050	5	Great for the money, just make sure you give them away, 3 truffles = 80% DV saturated fat, wow.
2051	1	With even the tiniest amount of this stuff in my cat's food, he won't touch it. Says  You cat will love it  on the package, but they should have added that some cats will hate it.<br /><br />That was $15 down the drain. I'll report to my cat's vet that his suggestion sucked. He should have given us a small sample to try out first.<br /><br />My cat is FIV with liver disease. We have to try whatever we can. Be warned that your cat may not love it either.<br /><br />This review is only on the product, not the selling company. The package arrived quickly and in good order.
2052	5	Good Seasons Caesar is the only salad dressing my husband wants, & he eats LOTS of salad. I buy the Zesty Italian for myself; & I experiment with various vinegars, oils & added ingredients in both Caesar & Italian. I've read reviews that reported Good Seasons dry mixes to be the best-tasting salad dressings on the market, & I certainly can't disagree. Amazon is the only place I find these dressings (NEVER in our local grocery stores!).  Its availability in bulk plus free shipping makes it so very convenient to keep in stock, too.  No wonder I go into a panic when I occasionally find that it's out of stock & that I'll be notified by email when it becomes available!  So far, thank Goodness, I've never run completely out before receiving that notice!
2053	4	I wouldn't describe these as the best dried cherries I have ever eaten but they were pretty good.<br /><br />Traverse uses oil with the cherries to prevent caking, a little to much in my opinion.  These cherries unlike the blueberries I bought from them were not as effected taste wise as the blue berries were.<br /><br />I would buy these again, the portion compared to the price makes them a great deal and their taste was rather enjoyable.<br /><br />These are not the best cherries out there but they are worth buying and their price is a great deal.  Just make sure you have a large enough container to store them in and I recommend storing them in the fridge.
2054	5	I heard about this coffee late.  It is a Special Edition flavor of Green Mountain, that only comes out in the spring till it's gone.  I think it would have been even better with a more bold say medimum roast versus the light roast they use.<br /><br />If you like coconut it adds an unusual and different taste to coffee.  I would never have thought of coconut as a flavor for coffee but it is actually very good.
2055	5	I absolutely love this bread flour, i have tried a lot of different ones and this is my favorite ! Great texture and you taste the freshness when the bread is done. It is similar to German breads. Once you try this, you'll fall in love !
2056	5	Great product and good price! Shipment was made quickly as well. Go Gummi Bears! Very fresh candy out of the box.
2057	2	Cons:<br />1. Neither of my children liked the taste. They loved Earth's Best, even the vegetables.<br />2. It is not as convenient as the Earth's Best when travelling since you have to carry a spare container to serve this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. BPA free packaging<br />2. Organic and preservative free.<br /><br />The lining of the lids in Earth's Best is reported to contain BPA. My search for quality baby food continues...
2058	5	Himalayan natural salt is the absolute best salt in the world in my opinion. If all you've ever had is processed white table salt then you owe it to yourself to try this wonderful elixir from the earth.  Unlike processed table salt Himalayan salt is a pinkish color with natural minerals available as the Creator intended his creation to consume. The taste is extraordinary and you will find that all foods you prepare will taste better with the addition of this salt. Although more expensive than common salt the taste is well worth the added expense and the packaging by the Spice Labs is more than adequate to protect this worthwhile investment.  Not only good tasting but much healthier for you and your family.
2059	3	This coffee is ok, but nothing great, at least in my opinion..  I will not throw it away, but neither will I order any more.  It has that sharp aftertaste that I don't care for.  It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.
2060	5	Fast shipping, product was what I ordered and in great condition.Iwill do business with this company again
2061	5	These are my favorite dark chocolate.  I don't like overly sweet chocolates and love the combination of salt and dark chocolate.  These are very tasty and just the right size if you want to have a small daily dose of dark chocolate, but don't want to load up on calories.
2062	1	this is nowhere near the quality and taste of Splenda's french vanilla  flavors for coffee . <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW257S >Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor Blends for Coffee, French Vanilla, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>
2063	1	This product IS misleading.  Soybean and/or canola oil are the first ingredients, and olive oil is further down on the ingredients list.  I'm looking for a mayo made with olive oil.  Soybeans and canola are now genetically modified, unless they are organic.  But even organic soy is not good for people with thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders or digestive issues.  Soy is causing a plethora of health issues.  Organic or not -- soy is not good for us...and neither is genetically altered canola.
2064	5	Even though a few of the bags were ripped and the noodles spilled into the box, these were a great find. It is very hard to find decent tasting pasta / noodles for a low carb lifestyle and these are delicious! Taste like egg noodles to me!
2065	5	Of all the Quaker oatmeal flavors this one is our favorite.  I actually look forward to having a bowl when I get up in the morning. Cooks fast and easy. Highly recommended.
2066	5	My son LOVES these foods. He has always been reluctant to be fed food because he loves feeding himself. He'll still sit down for a bag of this stuff.
2067	5	We needed a high quality wet cat food to help our sick kitty get his appetite back, put on some weight, and get him into recovery. He had turned up his nose at a great many foods, including the expensive Rx stuff from the vet we were told no cat could resist. Well, Sylvester gave it a definite 4 paws down.  Then we discovered Wellness Chicken Formula Grain Free wet cat food. Sylvester loves this food. He is looking healthier, his coat is shiny, he is friskier and more playful, and all around seems a much happier cat. He meows for his food and races to his bowl when it is feeding time. I have ordered another 2 cases to stock my kitty pantry with this great food.
2068	5	When I first tried this I thought it would be a smoothie type drink like I would find in a retail Jamba store. Little did I know this thing was packed full o' nutrition!<br />Great tasting, and a shot is all that is required daily. Great stuff!
2069	5	I'm a tea snob and typically buy the more expensive whole leaf teas by the ounce, but when traveling, I typically take bagged tea for convenience. I've tried all the usual brands you typically find at your local grocery store and they're all just terrible. No really... just awful. I had been making do with PG Tips, as they make a reasonable cup of tea but then I discovered Dilmah while in Australia. This is the best bagged tea I've ever had. Period. And before Amazon started carrying it, I had to get it from various importers (and pay too much).<br /><br />This Dilmah tea has a crisp, rich, smooth flavor with a sweet finish. It's great for a breakfast tea, takes milk well and is even great iced (I'm drinking some as I type this). It's good enough that I sometimes crave it over my precious whole leaf teas. And like all bag tea (aka shake), don't over steep! 30-60 seconds is all you need.
2070	5	I have a Magnifica espresso machine and have been looking for great espresso to go with it.  I've finally found it with Lavazza Super Crema.  It's not too bold; it's perfect for lattes.  I haven't tried it with any other drinks, but I'm sure it would taste excellent with anything.<br /><br />Also, if you're like me and love the aroma of espresso brewing in your house - this one does the trick.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for all coffee lovers!
2071	5	I love these bears because their sweetness is a bit more subtle than the regular gummy bears--I don't like things to be too sweet. That doesn't mean these guys are lacking in flavour, though...just that they taste more like fruit and less like sugar! They're chewier as well, which is something else I love--keeps me from eating too many at a time!
2072	3	When the first ingredient is water, I have to ask myself what I'm paying for?  I have tried two of the six dressings so far and I'm not impressed with the flavors or ingredients.  The Cilantro Lime didn't taste like either and the Feta cheese and Calamata olives was lacking in taste too.  My suggestion is to buy some good extra virgin olive oil and a vinegar you like and make your own dressing.  I will not be buying this again and will probably end up using it as a marinade since it's not good on salads.  If you add some salt the taste is a bit better but far from what I expected.
2073	5	My cats will vote with their feet if I do not provide a dinner-time snack of Fancy Feast.  It is a rich, obviously delicious, cat food with (check the label) good, healthy ingredients.  I feed wet food as a treat twice a day along with kibble.  Cats get their water from the wet food and living in a desert environment, I consider this essential for their well being.
2074	5	Chocolate with coconut!  How can you lose?<br /><br />I love Ross Chocolates.  You can really tell that they are made of top quality chocolate.  It is creamy and flavorful.<br /><br />I enjoy these (and I buy several flavors...all have the same great quality and taste) especially because I try to keep my sugar intake to a minimum.  I keep a supply of them in my refrigerator in airtight containers at all times.  They keep very nicely.
2075	5	I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes.
2076	5	I have a 8 week old Chihuahua puppy named Louie and he really loves this food!! It arrived on time, In great condition, and I think for the price it was well worth it!! This bag is lasting a long time also!! I really recommend this brand! It smells fresh and tasty, its small and easy for my puppy to chew!! I'm a very happy customer!!
2077	1	I found this at Walmart for $3.00, and on taste alone, it is way overpriced. I'm not sure how they pass this stuff off. Like another reviewer said, the texture is weird. It honestly made me feel like I was eating dirt. The sauce isn't good, either. I could taste just a hint, a very fleeting hint, of alfredo. Even the pasta they use tastes weird. It doesn't look very appealing when cooked, either. My husband didn't even want to try it. Never again.
2078	3	When I ordered the gummi fish I also decided to order this item as well to try out,  and while I found the gummi fish to be truly enjoyable the gummi centipedes while alright tasting weren't anything to shout about as they tasted just the same almost as regular gummi worms you can buy anywhere.  I felt the only difference between the two was that the centipede ones had little legs and some were different colors but in all that was about it really.  It's not bad or bad tasting candy but it just felt like why bother getting this when I can get the same thing with a 5lb bag of regular gummi worms at the candy store nearby.....
2079	5	Wellness wet cat food is terrific.<br />My three cats gobble it up.<br />Healthy too.<br />My diabetic cat went didn't need insulin anymore after I switched from dry food to this wet food.<br />And she went from highly overweight to just fine.
2080	5	This candy is amazing!  I've always bought it from the pseudo candy shops in the mall, which charge nearly $10 for one pound!  Amazon hooks us up with this delicious treat for a fraction of the cost!  I will be buying this candy on a regular basis just for my own personal enjoyment.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon, thank you!
2081	5	I purchased this as a gift, but there was enough to share.  I kept some and used it in my chili recipe.  We don't like real spicy food but the smoked paprika gave the chili a great taste without too much spice.  I have used it in several other recipes since with great results.
2082	1	FYI read the ingredient list on the product. It contains quite a few ingredients, including soy. Earth's Best is a better choice.
2083	3	This is an ok buy. I was really hoping there would have been some interviews with Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, and Geena Davis. Deleted / Extended scenes have to be out there somewhere!  ...but the picture and sound are great!
2084	1	Worse product ever produced by Planters.  I tried to return the reamaing three cans to Amazon, but they could not give refunds on food products.<br />So, I have three cans in my pantry.... until death do us part  I guess.
2085	5	I first bought these chips at Marshall's Department Store and wondered how to get more...Well I went to the web site and found them here...they are very tasty and fresh and I highly recommend them!
2086	5	Product arrived promptly and securely packaged. The turkey gizzards were very tender but somewhat mild in flavor (dipped them in mustard to add a little  zest  to them when I ate them). Pork Hocks were also tender with a mild flavor. The Polish Sausage I liked the best - a sweeter, vinegary taste (it was hard for me not to eat the whole jar of Polish Sausage in one sitting). The eggs were fine (used them - sliced - on salads).<br /><br />All-in-all, I was very pleased with the sampler as well as the service from WisconsinMade.
2087	5	i can't say how this coffee tastes hot and/or black, but it is fantastic iced with milk and sugar. the taste is like a better version of dunkin donuts' iced coffee. and i love that it is organic.
2088	5	The combination of potato, mushroom, and meat is perfect and it is simply tasteful.<br />If you are a meat lover, this is most probably the best canned soup you can buy online, as I have tried almost all different Campbell's and Progressos.<br />Also if you don't care either at all for neither noodles in a soup nor runny soups, this is what satisfies you for sure.
2089	1	[...]<br /><br />Please check this out and DO NOT feed these to your pets.  Take them back to where you bought them and make them aware, MADE IN CHINA.
2090	5	Where have these been all my life? I love them and will be getting more for gifts for my parents.
2091	5	I have been eating these crackers for the past 10 years and boy are they delicious.  A mellow buttery flavor in a cracker that cracks readily and melts in your mouth.  Be careful, they're addictive.
2092	5	She loves many of the natural balance products but for some reason this is her fave...we also purchase the dry dog food in the same flavor since she is a fan. LOVE all their products!
2093	5	These candy cigarettes are awesome. They will last for a while because there are so many of them. They are at a great price. Overall I think these candy cigarettes are worth more than the cost and you should buy them.
2094	5	I drink this everyday and love it.  I used to get this as a monthly automatic purchase.  I was bummed they discontinued this option but I do love the product.
2095	5	Want to preserve your peaches & apples as pie filling?  I've been using this product from Berry Farm for 2 years and it makes a wonderful thickener for canning pie fillings.
2096	5	I have been very happy with the quality of this product and with the regular shipment.  I put it all in a large ziploc bag and some in a smaller container to serve out of and it keeps beautifully!  Hempseed is very good for cutting sugar cravings.  I eat 3-6 T. every morning over fruit and with walnuts...yum!!
2097	5	Since my daughter was 18 months old until now (she's almost 3) she has loved this oatmeal and eaten the whole bowl (when I add organic raisins).  She's a picky eater, so the other review is a surprise to me.
2098	5	My dad first sent me this spice mix from his home in Hawaii, and we absolutely love it -- I put it in soups, stirfrys, salads, etc. We love spicy flavors and this one is really superior - the challenge is not to use it up too fast!
2099	4	A flavored, light ground coffee which is still full of flavor with a nice aftertaste.  It's probably my second favorite flavored coffee with their Madagascar Vanilla Nut my favorite.
2100	5	I was surprised at how fresh and soft the licorice was! The shipping was a lot quicker than I expected too. I would order this again. Great deal for a great price.
2101	5	This is good stuff.  I have not reconstituted it and tried it as spreadable peanut butter and I doubt that I will, BUT I am mixing it with CLICK Espresso Protein Drink, Mocha and Vanilla Latte (14-Servings in 16-Ounce Canister) mix for a fabulous protein drink.  Even if you come across a fleck that has not dissolved in the mix instead of a burst of yuck on your tongue you get a burst of peanut butter!  Unless it was a burst of chocolate, I cannot think of how that could be better.  I've only tried the  plain  PB2, but have the cocoa PB2 on order.  I've gone from having nothing palatable in the way of protein powders to 2 wonderful products that I found on Amazon--PB2 and Click.  Check them out!!
2102	5	My kids love all of the Annie's crackers but this snack mix is their favorite. It's cheesey but not overpowering and has good flavor. The crackers are a bit thinner and more airy that those fish shaped crackers and my 15 month old daughter can eat them easily. Amazon does an amazing job mailing these as well! Four boxes shrink-wrapped together in a box with some packing bubbles to prevents breakage. We are currently overseas and my kids are missing their favorite snacks...Amazon shipped this to our APO address and it still got here within four days!! We signed up for subscribe and save!
2103	5	I am hooked on this cappuccino - it's a great pick me up in the afternoon without giving me a caffeine rush. The package of 3 boxes was a great price and they didn't take long to get here.
2104	3	I have to admit, I don't track the results, so who knows if it's working, but I have no complaints.  It also smells amazing and the consistency is good. My only issue is that the pump is stiff, so you either end up getting nothing, or spilling out far more than you could ever use on two eyes in just one pump.  I feel like i put more energy into dispensing it than anything else.  Otherwise though, no complaints.
2105	2	I have used the granular swerve in many things with great results, but the confectioners type? Um, it's great until you drink something after you eat it. YUK! The most horrible aftertaste I've ever experienced with any sweetener. It must be whatever they used to make it into a powder, but I'm warning you now. It tastes fine eating it, but don't drink anything after! My water tasted like a super sweet sugary liquid--just disgusting. I had to go each something to get the taste out of my mouth. Total thumbs down because of that.
2106	4	I thought this is a pretty good food, and a great value for the money. As the previous review stated, it contains a bit too much grains and byproducts.<br />I was really surprised by the kibble size. It's too big! I thought first I received dog food by mistake; re-read the label - no, that's cat food. Wow, way too large for my cats' little mouths. They seem to have fun with it, though - crunching on the pieces (good teeth cleaner at the same time?).<br /><br />However, as two of my cats can be considered seniors, I will have to switch to a different food, something with smaller bits, to make it easier for them.
2107	2	Ordered directly from Amazon.  Label on box said Tangy Tomato & Bacon Dressing & Marinade.  Bottles inside are labeled Tangy Bacon CATALINA Dressing & Marinade.  Not Amazons' fault, Kraft says it is the same recipe as Tangy Tomato & Bacon, but it tastes slightly different than the original.
2108	5	I bought 6 and got 1 free. This drink is a miracle. The juice from Goji Berry, Acai ,Mangosteen and Noni helped me to improve my vision, my mood , my immune system,i feel nice in my body , wrinkles are gone, gave me all necessary vitamins and nutritional stuff, repaired my joints. I gave to my girl a bottle, to my mom and to my sister and to my grandma. It doesn't taste bad and has no sugar which means is good for diabetics as well. The best healthiest drink ever. Thank you Genesis Today.  Will buy again !
2109	3	Staples sells the smaller 105 piece tub for only $5.99. That price is good until 9/1/2011.  Unless you have Amazon Prime and get this shipped for free, I'd go with the cheaper Staples product.
2110	5	i am a hot chocolate addict, and this is the best one I have come across. It has a rich flavor with a hint of spices in it. It's really great.
2111	5	I found that Timothy's Columbian Decaf k-cups to have the flavor of regular coffee. Economical in 50-cup pack - along with free shipping. Makes it competitive with retail store items on sale.
2112	5	Very good.  Hint of guava, but not sour and not sweet.  Great way to blend vegetables and fish.  I try to always have some on hand.  Often is hard to find where I live!
2113	5	I managed to purchase 16-count boxes of the Starbucks French Roast and Sumatra K-cups at the Asheville, NC Wal-Mart and a 54-count box of the Starbucks Caffe Verona at the Greenville, SC COSTCO.  All three varieties make tasty brews, but I found the Caffe Verona to be exceptional.  In my opinion, that blend makes the absolute best tasting K-cup coffee I have ever had.  HIGHLY recommend the Caffe Verona!
2114	5	These are very different from your average  fortune cookie --and I prefer these! They have a nice hint of coocnut, very flakey, and the msgs are written on a nice wax paper. There are  only  12 cookies in the box, but that's clear if you read the nutrition info...plus, if you're wanting to buy lots of cookies, there are plenty of other options out there. These are fun and delicious and the fortunes are fantastic.
2115	4	As the title says, this is a good basic cup of coffee.  We feel a little frustrated by the 6 ounce default pour - does anyone still drink coffee in these lilliputian quantities? Still, with a little time spent pressing the  give me more  button, we can get a nice full cup of medium bodied coffee. We generally alternate cups between this and Gevalia Vanilla Hazelnut on the weekends.
2116	5	I'm on a restrictive diet and fresh apples are not allowed. I found these on the shelves of my local CVS for $1 a jar. They are nice and slightly crisp with a wonderful sweet flavor. They almost have an apple pie taste! I'm going back to buy them out! Love them and I'm sure you will too!~<br /><br />Mike
2117	5	I loved this Caramel Cappuccino. It reminds me of the taste of Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccino with the caramel flavoring. I made it hot and it was delicious. Then I made it with ice and it was even better!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to buy this flavor because I saw a negative review and it came in a 36 count package. I didn't want to have to throw out that many Kcups if it was awful. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig a few days ago so we're still testing out all of the good flavors. I've got this on my list of Kcups to stock up on in the future! The Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino is our second favorite flavor at the moment; our favorite is the Celestial Seasonings Sweet Southern Tea.<br /><br />Note: This cappuccino is very sweet. We love sweet drinks so this is great for us. I think it's perfect. However, if you don't like sweet drinks, you may not care for this.
2118	5	This is not for the weak! It requires work and I mean DAILY maintenance to grow your grains and maintain them. I can buy a few people getting  bad grains  but most are probably irritated by how much work it is. You have to keep them fed and alive and you have to care. It's ok if you give up and decide it's just not for you, but don't blame the seller for your own issues. My sister in law got me interested but her milk grains were suffering because she was using Raw milk. SHE researched (not me) that using low pasturized milk helped to grow the grains so when i bought my own (from this seller) I took her advice and used low pasturized milk only as a start. HOLY COW! I uploaded a picture of my grain and it is HUGE. That is just ONE grain mind you, I have either gifted the others, used them for making cheese or (sniff, sniff) tossed them in the disposal because I don't need that much kefir. Most of my grains I have gifted have been murdered because the folks who took them didn't like the maintenance they require. It is hard work people, but it's all about what you are willing to put yourself through for good health. It's ok if you can't handle it, life is hard enough but like I said, don't blame the seller just because you couldn't hack it! Just FYI (more sis in law research here) for a casein and lactose free diet you must let the grains sit for at least 25 - 28 hours. I screwed up and only did 24 hrs and my son is supposed to be on a casein free diet so be careful... It's a science after all. My grain is now large enough that I can use raw milk but I have noticed I still have to rock back and forth between low pasturized and raw in order to keep the grain healthy. I'm sure some folks would disagree with me but I'm just going on my own experience here and the proof is in the pudding so to speak. Have fun!
2119	5	This definitely satisfies you when you need a little something sweet. I find I don't even have to eat too much of me to be satisfied. The taste is great and best of all it doesn't cause upset stomach like many other sugar-free products do.
2120	2	I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.
2121	5	This product makes the best waffles.  It is like having them out at a restaurant.  They are light, crispy and smell wonderful!
2122	3	Sure, everyone has differing tastes, but I found these to be quite horrid - the point that I ate one bar, and threw the rest away. They are too dry, too flavorless and just uninspired. There are lots of better options out there with more flavor.
2123	5	There isn't a ton of variation between the brands. I have had Jiffy Pop and this and the pre-made packages and I think the taste identical. Either way, the taste is delicious and doesn't disappoint! I make these in my Roosevelt 8oz maker and cart!. It's AWESOME!
2124	5	if you are looking for a protein bar that doesn't have that thick chalky taste this is it! power crunch bars taste more like cookies than a protein bar! love them!!
2125	5	i live in the south and must be honest when i say that this tea is much better than even the local restaurants can make.  it is sweet without being overly syrupie.  i did find out that i have to stir it a little more than i would a regular cup of tea that is warm.  but, that is probably to be expected.  it is good!
2126	5	We have seven kitties...we go through a lot of catnip.  I used to buy Cosmic Catnip at PetSmart but they no longer carry it (boo, PetSmart!).  We tried a different brand but the kitties weren't fooled.  Cosmic Catnip is the only catnip they enjoy.  They go wild over it!  Right now the plastic cup is empty and they are in mourning over it.
2127	2	I have tried several energy boost supplement drinks and thought this one might be good.  I sampled the Acai Pomegranate flavor, and it did not taste like acai berry or pomegranate.  The flavor was intensely sweet and the mixture a bit slimy--even with additional liquid.  I didn't like the texture of the drink at all.  As for ingredients, it seemed to have all the vitamins associated with energy boost, though it also contained caffeine.  That's a big turn off for me.  If it had tasted badly but still gave solid results, I would just choose another flavor.  I'm not interested in a caffeinated product.  I also found the packaging difficult to open and resorted to scissors.  Not very efficient for those on-the-go.  It may be a great flavor for some, and the caffeine may not be a bother.  I won't invest further in this product.
2128	4	We have always used  Bags on Board  for our pet clean up.  Unfortunately, this time, the container that hangs on the leash broke off and we had to purchase a new one.  I can't say how it happened because my husband was walking the dog.  However, I would not let that keep me from purchasing this product. It is lightweight, easily dispensed and, having them on the leash, makes it so simple to clean up after your dog.  Everyone should be required to carry something as a courtesy to walkers.  You can use other types of plastic bags from groceries or other purchases, but these are the most compact and easiest to carry around and use.
2129	5	My husband is gluten-intolerant. We just bought a bag of Glutino Pretzel Sticks and were amazed at the flavor.  We both think they taste better than regular pretzels.
2130	1	I echo the other 1 star review. This stuff is terrible and he is right-on in each of his observations. I can only add that the stuff should not be allowed to be sold.
2131	5	This is a terrific tasting coffee.  My daughter and I have tasted many different brands and flavors and we have enjoyed this one the most.  The best part was finding it on Amazon.  The ease of  ordering and great price are great.  Now we never have to wake up in the morning and realize that we are out of this great eye opener because of the convenience  of being able to order so many at one time.
2132	1	My 13 week old Shepherd/Lab mix has a bit of a sensitive tummy and unfortunately these didn't agree with her. The first time I gave her one, it gave her loose stools, the second one she threw up.
2133	5	My favorite flavor of kind bar.  The dark chocolate is not too sweet and the fruity/nutty textures and flavors really shine.  A very healthy splurge !!!
2134	5	my dog and any visitors love these treats, they are not too hard on her old teeth and seem to have good ingredients.
2135	5	Our dogs loves this brand name of snacks so much... They can't get enough of these snacks.
2136	5	These bars make a great breakfast or snack. Packed with fruits and nuts and soooo good! I would definately try them, you will like them!
2137	4	Both my husband and I love the taste of this oatmeal.  A nutty flavor with wonderful texture.  I never realized how bland some oatmeal was until I tried this brand.  This is a long cooking oatmeal but worth the wait.  I think that precooked oatmeal has too many nutritients removed in the process. If you want fiber in your diet, this is one of the best sources available and low calorie if don't add in butter or cream.  I always make a big pot of it so it lasts the week.  I add jam or preserves for sweetness and sometimes maple syrup or honey.  Fresh fruit when in season really is great or spices for a change. Since we use it daily, the 28 ounce tins are the most economical especially if on sale.
2138	5	I love hot cider in the winter, but since I'm currently on weight watchers I didn't want to waste the calories. This is a perfect treat for zero points! I didn't think it was weak at all (brewed on a single cup personal size Keurig). It is very sweet so you definitely have to enjoy a caramel flavor. It does not taste like real cider (and of course can't rival Sbux hot caramel cider!) but is certainly a fun low calorie indulgence. The sweetener is aspartame which I have no problem with but I know some people don't like. I would say give it a try!
2139	2	Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like.
2140	5	The Roasted Unsalted Sunflower Seeds are fresh and tasty.  Make a fantastic and healthy snack!  Great for dieting.  Love 'em !!
2141	5	I just tried this coffee, as I enjoy experimenting with different products. I am really enjoying it from several perspectives: 1) It had a really different taste than what one normally gets from most store-bought coffee, 2) it not at all oily...many coffees are overly roasted to hid inferior quality...no need to over-roast this coffee as it stands tall on its own -- you can see the lack of oil by how the coffee comes out of the grinder cleanly, and 3) we like supporting both organic, sustainable farming, as well as local boutique businesses.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is coffee we really enjoy, especially on leisurely weekend mornings, and it is now on our short list of most-favored coffees.  Highly recommended without reservation!
2142	5	This is the BEST flour that is gluten free out on the makret. I have tired many different products and been sadly disappointed with the nasty after taste, and some of the flour has actually made my daughter cry after tasting the dough! But not Pamela's :)<br />I am very happy we were able to buy this in bulk because it is very expensive and sometimes hard to find in grocery stores.<br />BIG LOVE PAMELA! &lt;3
2143	3	I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good.
2144	5	I generally stay away from coconut water because they have strong smell and are expensive. I was surprised when Amazon offered this at a HUGE discount. prompted me to order 2 sets of 12. They are fantastic. I love them. No after taste, no strong smell. Great hydration after a run or workout.
2145	4	Nature's Path new breakfast product, Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise, is a good tasting cereal that is  gluten free.   It tastes lightly sweetened, a combination of corn flakes, crispy rice, and crunchy puffed corn. The crunchy and chewy texture is maintained in milk for several minutes even though the food is gluten free. The cereal is sweetened with cane juice and molasses. The ingredients include: corn, rice, flax, quinoa, buchwheat, and amaranth. There is 1g of fat (no saturated fat) 25g of carbs and 2g of protein per serving of 2/3 cup. There is an important warning that the cereal is produced in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts, and soy.<br /><br />Like many organic cereal products today, the price point is substantial for the 10.6 oz box. I ate the cereal with side dishes of Greek yogurt, blueberries and boysenberries, and walnuts. The cereal's flavor held its own against these other foods, and I will buy it in the future.
2146	2	I wouldn't call this a true, delicately subtle floral Earl Grey. The tea, no matter how long or which style it is brewed in, is overly tannic, like a cheap supermarket brand of black tea. It is lovely to smell, disappointing to drink - very little citrus tones (as in, none I could detect) with just the slightest tang of bergamot oil. Extremely disappointing. A good buy if you do not enjoy earl grey but love the smell.
2147	1	The way this item was displayed in Amazon made it look like I was getting a 3-pack of the cappuccino for $25.00.  Instead, I was charged $25.00 each for a total of $75.00!  This is way too much for the product and I am highly disappointed that Amazon allowed this kind of misleading information.
2148	5	I had the small version of the everlasting treat ball, but both my Corgi and Shiba were able to pop out the treats pretty quickly. So I order the large treat ball (which is surprisingly huge). I could barely force the treats into the giant treat ball, but that is good, because neither of my dogs can get the treats out now. Instead it keeps my corgi occupied for ages, and when he has to go in his crate I toss it in there to keep him busy. He loves it. My shiba is not quite as interested in it, but that is just her nature. It was a bit expensive but worth it to keep the puppy busy.
2149	5	We were buying Bahlsen cookies at $1.70-$2.19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are $1.41/box here at Amazon!
2150	5	I'm very pleased with this combo dandruff shampoo and conditioner. It works well in terms of dandruff control, but unlike other medicated shampoos I've tried, it's pretty mild - it didn't feel nearly as  severe  on my head.<br /><br />Although my days of a full, thick head of hair are long gone, I like to treat the surviving stragglers with care in the hopes that their inevitable departure can be delayed as long as possible. This seems to strike a good balance between effective dandruff treatment but not at the expense of my hair and scalp. Highly recommend.
2151	5	For years haven't been able to locate Oregon Purple Plums in the Supermarkets in my area in Southwest Florida.  When living in New York had them all the time.  When I finally found them on Amazon my husband and I were delighted.  We enjoy them practically every day.  Just can seem to get enough of them.  Don't understand why the stores don't carry them along with the other Oregon fruit products they do carry.
2152	5	Very very spicy syrup with very little pumpkin.... I took my bottle after using it 1 time and not being able to drink it and added it to the blender. I added a whole can of pumpkin puree and it is still too spicey:( Although this syrup was not a good fit for me Amoretti's customer service was amazing! After telling them of my dissatisfaction of their pumpkin spice they immediately tried to make amends.<br /><br />A++++ on customer service and what an awesome company! Pumpkin product not so great though! Their other products are amazing! Choose a different flavor and you will be extremely satisfied!
2153	1	I ordered the pure cranberry juice pack for around $70.00 and received the cheaper juice blend for around $40.00.  It is not returnable and all I can see to do is write a bad review.  I'm out $30.00.  I definitely wanted the pure juice, but I have no faith in this seller to try again.
2154	5	This potato soup remined me of the potato soup my mother used to make us while she was still alive.  I grew up on this and it is delicious.
2155	5	My cat was eating the regular Natural Balance Ultra Premium formula until I realized there was a reduced calorie formula. She was overweight at the time, and she lost a pound after eating this food regularly for about 2.5 months. She was then switched to a half dry/half wet diet to increase her hydration, and she now also eats this same formula but in the wet food. She wakes me up every morning for her dry breakfast before my alarm goes off. She loves this stuff, and it makes her coat soft and shiny on top of her weight loss! I would definitely recommend this product to others. (The only downside I've noticed is that the small kibbles are small enough that she just swallows them whole most of the time, and if they were bigger, they'd help clean her teeth as she bites them--then I wouldn't have to brush her teeth!)
2156	5	I'm having trouble finding Reese's Pieces in grocery stores these days.  They used to be popular, but ever since the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup obsession came out with its many sizes and varities (especially during the holiday season) the Reese's Pieces have either been pushed to the side, or even worse, sort of gone out of style.  An outrage?  Not quite, just disappointing.  An outrage is that I can't find Mars Bars anymore when I distinctly remember finding thse bars very easily 15 years ago.  Anyway, please pick up a bag of Reese's Pieces IF you can find them for less than 4 bucks.  11 bucks sold here on amazon is, yes, an outrage.  Factor in shipping and handling and... no.  Not worth it.  What a delicious tasty treat these things are though.  I have such a craving for these bite-sized, flavorful tasties and yet I can't satisfy it because I can't find them in stores!
2157	4	-the thing I did not care for that much was the smell it was okay but I guess I was expecting a fresh smell and it smelled like any other old shampoo on the market today.  For a new product, I was expecting more.  If it was on the shelves at the store-it does not stand out that much from any other brand of shampoo including the design which reminded me of Dove shampoo.<br /><br />If the price is not bad I would buy again.
2158	4	These aren't the healthiest things a person could eat, but they are better for you than a lot of the breakfast bars available. My 2 year old loves them, so we have them on subscribe and save. She asks for these whenever she wants a snack.
2159	5	So glad to see this at a decent price at Amazon. Not easy to find Half Caff. I would even buy this in a larger quantity box.  Plus shipping was FREE. What more can you ask for. Green Mountain is my favorite and Amazon makes i happen.
2160	5	The Cuisine Mentor Mroccan Spice blend is wonderful, complex, spicy, and earthy. We have found it is great also just simply sprinkled on top of chicken or salmon, vaying the amount by how spicy you want it. Our guests have also raved about how wonderfull  our  creations were.
2161	4	If you like Stacy's pita chips, this is a good way to get them (reasonable price, free shipping).  This time the 6 bags were packed in 2 boxes one inside the other so there were no torn bags/spillage (which happened with an earlier batch).  My only concern was that the expiration dates on all the bags were 12/18/07.  This was OK at the time but I wouldn't want to order more bags and find out they have technically expired.
2162	5	Really delightful taste, very light, very, VERY British. Easy to prepare. I'd back off on the recommended sugar and back off a little on the recommended milk for a slightly thicker custard. Lovely, homey type of dessert, ideal with berries or shortcake. 100% recommended -- this stuff is heavenly!!!
2163	5	If you drink alot of Kool-Aid, this is for you!!  I used to buy this at Sam's Club, but it wasn't always there.  My family goes through so much of this I can't just buy little packages and mix all day long!  This behemoth is the best!  We love it!  It's 9 1/4 inches tall and just over 5 inches diameter.  It already has the sugar in it.  It comes with a scoop inside.  And directions to make a glass or a pitcher.  It is so easy.  It's kind of big for cupboards.  But since we use it so often, I just leave it on the counter top.  Also, this IS a 2 pack.  So, the second one, I just set in my laundry room which is around the corner from my kitchen.  We are even on the the plan to have it sent to us every other month.  Seriously, if you drink alot, this is really wonderful!
2164	4	The only drawback to this product is how hard it is to find. Amazon to the rescue...I come here and order several jars to keep on hand. Roasted Chili paste is a key ingredient I use in making a BBQ Tofu dish. I don't like tofu all that much, yet this dish makes it one of my favorites for guilt-free goodness. BTW, this product stores just fine in your cupboard, and when you need a kind of spicy, slightly smokey and unexpected  kick  in any dish, this will do it. Use in making your own BBQ sauce (I combine w/Tamari, lemon zest and sesame oil); add to stir fries, eggs...it's great.
2165	5	I found Smart Sugar at a local grocer about one year ago and it is so much better than other sugar replacements.  Try it and you will see that nothing else that is a sugar replacement comes any where close to this product.  Unfortunately the grocer that carried it is no longer in business and now I am looking hard to find it again out our local grocery store.  Good thing Amazon carries it...
2166	4	My dog loves em, i trust the  Newman  brand after all he was a great man, and his family is committed to doing better in the world. and they love there dogs!
2167	3	These are tasty, but a lot of work to make. They also were a bit expensive. They're good, but I don't know that I'd buy it again.
2168	5	My fiancee and I loved this sauce when we visited England last summer. We've been trying to find it in the US to no avail. But this product was cheap enough, delivered quickly, and comes in four bottles so you don't have to worry about storage of a huge bottle or the product going bad before you can use it. We'll definitely buy it again when we run out!
2169	5	I purchased a couple of these two help raise money for famine relief. I was shockingly impressed with this energy drink. I occasionally buy the 5-hour energy drink because I'm a nurse and work the graveyard shift. Street King taste better, it didn't give me the shakes like the 5-hour when it starts to wear off. I also notice that Street King suppressed my appetite. This energy drink makes me feel the same way I do after I have my b12 injections. Not sure if I'll buy it again because I'm not a huge caffeine fan but it is overall good drink.
2170	5	Once you pop one in your mouth...you can tell these ain't Doritos and that it is a quality product...now the secret is to buy em on sale...
2171	4	the idea of a chip alternative may be unconstitutional to some. but not when you have something like a bag of pop chips!<br /><br />they have lots of flavor and lots of crunch. they hold their own next to a sandwich. if you eat them too fast the array of spices can get in your nose and make you sneeze. so sit back and enjoy each bite!
2172	5	I have bought several brands, always  organic , these seem to be the freshest and least dry of the bags I have tried. I like them after lunch, without soaking, just for something sweet. I chew them one at a time to try to get the most flavor and to chew them well to get all the nutrients. They taste similar to other dried berries, but initially I thought they were a little bitter with an after taste like other reviewers have noted. My first bag lasted over 3 months, the second bag over a month opened (maybe that was the problem?). I no longer experience that, not sure why, now they taste great and I look forward to them and each a bag in about 5 days or so. If they really have all those antioxidants, they are worth the price!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLHSY >Navitas Naturals Organic Goji Berries Himalayan Superfruit, 16-Ounce Pouch</a> this brand seems to be the best so far for me...
2173	5	I really like this product. I love natural PB but have always hated the mess and annoyance of having to mix it up with a knife. I just leave this in the jar, give a quick swirl when needed and spread away. Awesome! I'm buying another for my mom.
2174	5	Oberto probably makes one of the BEST beef jerkey products. The packaging keeps it very flavorful and the Teriyaki is definitely my husband's favorite jerkey!
2175	5	Orange bitters are hard to find, never mind three in one place.  I really love the variety and enjoy them all.  In addition to cocktails, a dash is refreshing in soda water for those who don't like sugary drinks. Cleans the palate nicely.
2176	5	I've been buying my dog grocery store brands for almost a year but could not get and sustained weight loss because there was no nutrition details, and I wld get spooked that she wasnt getting enought nutrition.  This food provides full disclosure, low calories, high nutrition, and she loves it.
2177	3	I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't like bitter coffee.  This coffee does not brew very strong, and is also bitter.  I've found this to be true of most arabica blends.  The beans have the aroma of vanilla, but the vanilla flavor was very subtle.  I think this coffee would be okay for someone who doesn't like their coffee very strong.  But, if you like a good, strong cup of coffee, I would avoid this one.
2178	2	I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
2179	3	I love coffee and I start my day with it and I drink half a pot in the evenings too.  So I was excited to try this blend but it was not as exciting as the description on their website. The scent was fragrant and inviting but the taste fell flat. After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the  floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish  as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.  Try Komodo Dragon by Starbucks instead. Bob Marley needs to stick with his day job.
2180	5	You can't find this flavor anywhere else in America to my knowledge, or at least not easily, and to be sure it won't appeal to everybody, but I am the type of American that prefers salty flavors to sweet. In fact, I don't like most candy because it is too sweet for me.<br /><br />To my surprise, the nutrition information for this product claims zero sodium. Apparently, ammonium chloride is not metabolized as sodium in the human body. So the  salt  label is a bit of a misnomer. Yes, technically ammonia chloride is a salt, but not table salt and not sodium. I guess I will find out in a couple of hours how this stuff agrees with my digestive system. But if I'm allergic to it, that's my bad, not the fault of the product. Prior to K & H's Double Salt Licorice, I tried the Diamond (Zout) salt licorice by Gerrit Verbourg, which was also yummy, so I know already I am not very allergic.<br /><br />I like the taste, but it's not mind-blowing. I don't feel overpowered by the saltiness at all. I can pop three in my mouth at a time and chew with no problem. However, I have learned not to chew. I recommend sucking on the tokens instead until they slowly dissolve. This way a more intense licorice flavor is achieved, and less candy sticks to one's molars.<br /><br />One cautionary note, this coming from my Mother, that I would like to add for all licorice aficionados like myself. Consume licorice in MODERATION. Why? No, not because of tooth decay, although that's a good reason too, this candy being gooey and sticking to teeth. Not because of the calories, although calories is a valid concern. Not even because of the ammonia chloride, although that may have certain negative effects on human digestion in large quantities... Really the chief concern is that the licorice itself, and licorice extract, interferes with the human body's absorption of potassium and also has many other complicated interactions with the body. If you like licorice, a good idea would be to add bananas to your diet as well, because bananas are cheap, delicious and rich in potassium. But do not eat large quantities every day. If you find yourself bruising easily and taking a long time to recover from bruises, your licorice habit could be the cause. Word to the wise. Everything in moderation, dontcha know?<br /><br />Five stars because the product was just what it said it was, was manufactured 02-2012 and doesn't expire until 2014. All in all, an excellent value considering the price, and Amazon had it on my front porch less than two days after I ordered it. Maybe there is better salt licorice for sale somewhere on the Internet, I don't know, but I know for sure there isn't cheaper licorice. Note to other reviewers: no fair dissing the product because you don't like ammonia chloride. Don't buy it if you don't know what it is.
2181	5	My dog LOVES these treats!! And I feel good about giving them to her because they are natural and healthy. Plus the glucosamine has eliminated her joint stiffness and the vitamins have increased her vitality. Buy these treats for your dogs, they will love you for it!
2182	5	I have used this for as long as i have been cooking,I also bring it back from Germany every time I go there to visit.I use it to make chicken paprikash and to make the best goulash ever.
2183	5	Mariani makes some pretty terrific, delicious dried fruit. If you like pineapple, mango, papaya--or all of the above--then this great snack is for you! The small plastic bag comes well sealed for you to take it on the road with you when you're traveling and want a quick energy boost; and the contents remain fresh until the expiration date printed on the package.<br /><br />The dried fruit has no fat nor does it have cholesterol. The sodium content is low but you do have to watch out for the sugar--30 grams of it per serving, and there are four servings in this tiny six ounce package. If sugar is a health concern for you I would avoid eating this snack.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is fantastically tasty and very pleasant. There is also a slight  sweet and sour  effect from the rather sweet pineapple and the tangy mango dried bits of fruit. The papaya is also very sweet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fine dried fruit to anyone who wants a snack food or something they can eat fast when they're on the run and they just want a little energy sugar boost. It's also nice to serve to guests as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!
2184	5	I bought this thinking it would be  outstanding  Grated Parmesan, and it stacks up all its Parmesan flavor really well. To tell you the truth, it reminds me of some health food store brand that is not that well known. I put it on a veggie pizza, eggs, soup, salad, pasta, etc. Not bad to add to everything you eat. I'll go for another supply here next time.  You'll get used to it in time.  I've already used up 20 of the bottles in soups, or for my pet mice.
2185	1	These were ok.  I like a stronger tasting sauce.  Definitely like when they are not fried - therefore not all the fat.
2186	5	This is an amazing product !!  My dogs think they are getting a treat !!
2187	4	I've been using this travel bag at the gym for over a mth. but the color of the bag bled onto my white shirt (pink)....I can't get the stain out and now the shirt is ruined. And now the bag where it's pink is fading onto the white.  I really like the bag, the color and style though.  I just contacted Amazon and they were awesome about sending me out another one free of charge. It has room for your poof ball, shampoo, conditioner, razor, facial cleanser & soap in trial size bottles.
2188	4	This isn't a caviar for the caviar snob (as in, my mother spit it out) but I think that it tastes great for the price!  It's also much better than grocery store caviar, and the shipment arrived within 3 days of ordering!  The shipping speed was great, but I still think that $18 is incredibly overpriced for shipping costs.  Also, it DOES turn your poop green!  I wouldn't mention it if it hadn't already been mentioned a few times, but yes, like nuclear green.  Odd, to say the least.
2189	5	These bars are delicious and easy to grab when time is a factor.  I especially like the amount of protein available.  They are Gluten free and the sugar is low compared to other bars.  Amazon has the best price and it is well worth having them delivered on a schedule for even greater savings.
2190	5	My dog loves Greenies! Read some reviews about it online and tried it out since Amazon Prime shipping is free, the price was affordable, and my dog refuses to have his teeth brushed. I've been giving him 1 per day for a few days now and it's like a treat to him! I'm satisfied. :-)
2191	5	Just tried mallow bites in my hot cocoa and it was out of this world!  Where have you been all of my life?  These would also be great in cocoa krispies treats.  The possibilities are endless...
2192	1	Ordered product and waited for almost a month and a half and no shipment, company claimed it probably got lost in mail...well they lost a customer, I didnt want excuses, I wanted my black jelly beans.
2193	5	My dogs have been eating Canidae for years.  They have always done well on the food.  Currently, I have three dogs and they have had no issues with the new formulations.  I have to say that my black lab mix has an even brighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44# bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.  I definitely recommend this food.
2194	5	I grew up in California and this was the chili powder of choice in Southern California.  Moved to the East Coast after I married, and found that it is not available here.  I now either have to order it from Amazon or have a friend buy it for me when she visits family in Texas.
2195	5	I really like this creamer, the hazelnut is my favorite...I take these in my lunch to work, no refigeration is needed and they are just perfect for my coffee break at work. I do not like regular creamer in my coffee but few places offer flavored creamer (none that I know of anyway) so I take these along with me and it is much less expensive than buying a flavored mocha at a stand or shop. Add these to a regular cup of coffee, instant treat..without the big price tag.I will buy these again.
2196	5	Great snack to curb your appetite or replace a meal with if your trying to lose weight.
2197	5	We have received this for over six months and love it other than the price keeps creeping up.  Love the subscription program.
2198	5	Absolutely LOVE these!  They are a realistic substitue to real fries which I absolutely love.  These really help me stay on track while still being satisfied.
2199	3	The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!
2200	1	Unfortunately baby did not like this flavor at all- I tried to mix it with fruits and it usually does the trick but this specific meal has a very strong flavor very hard to cover.<br />I have to say that I did not like the taste either.<br />However baby is a big fan of the SPROUT Fruits pouches.
2201	5	I hadn't received the product but was contacted by the customer service department and spoke with a lovely young woman who is re-sending it and I should have it by Tuesday.<br /><br />This product has become quite popular as it was an ingredient featured in mung bean soup which was on a show of Dr. Oz.  They said they had 22 orders just today.<br /><br />Four stars from me for customer service.
2202	2	I ordered 3 bottles of Heinz Yellow Mustard (17oz Upside down).  What I received was 6 bottles of Heinz Spicy Brown Mustard (17oz Upside down).  I have tried to contact the shipper but to date........No response.  I wish I could make these purchases all of the time.......Pay for 3 and receive 6.  Amazon Marketplace really DOES NOT work for me.  I would not suggest using Amazon Marketplace to anyone.
2203	1	We found this coffee<br /> to be  rather bland and fairly weak. For an assortment it all tasted the same. Won't buy it again.
2204	5	This cola and the energy drink are the two best reasons to invest in a soda stream maker, they taste excellent and if you only drink soda occasionally you will always have a fresh fizzy drink.
2205	3	I prefer coconut water to Gatorade or other sports drinks for re-hydration; in addition to being natural, they are packed with electrolytes and their taste is no better, no worse.<br /><br />Zico, however, is form concentrate.  Calling their product 'Pure Premium' seems very misleading when other products are actually pure and this one has been modified. If you're being frugal, this product works fine, but personally, I'd spare the extra few bucks and go with Vita Coco or One.
2206	5	I love these flavors! Finally found something great to add to meatloaf! Gives it a great taste with fruit and veggies also in there! My son loves these when we are at the park.
2207	5	This is a great tasting snack that you will never mind giving to your kids. Made out of organically raised fruit, they have lots of the right things (vitamin B & vitamin C) and none of the wrong things (no added sugars, no artificial colors, no preservatives). So, if you are a parent, and want some really good snacks that you will feel good about giving your children, then get Clif Kid Twisted Fruit Ropes. I highly recommend them!
2208	3	Love the fact that these bags are biodegradable!  Helps me to feel more okay with tossing the bags after each use.  However, we've had several bags that have had leaky bottoms as soon as milk has been poured into them :(  Doesn't make me happy after having to work to get the milk.  Other than that, we have liked these bags - especially the price.
2209	5	my wife loves it. it is the only mg product that she takes willingly and according to her it nullifies all her period troubles.
2210	1	I love spearmint licorice, especially the twisters and after a lot of research I was excited to find a site that was able to satisfy my yearning.<br />The packaging of the licorice was very flimsy, very hard to get off the licorice. Once you are able to get the thin cello off the licorice you are met with very hard, and impossible to take the licorice apart to eat. What little you could break off was hard and stale. Very disappointed in the product and am even more disappointed with the way the company has handled it (or I should say hasn't handled it) I contacted them and they haven't bothered responding to my correspondance. We paid a premium price for the licorice 8.99 a package and ended up throwing out the total product because it was simply unacceptable and impossible to enjoy. So, on two notes , I would be cautious about ordering from them, because there is a chance they won't bother to answer your correspondance and secondly the product they delivered us wasn't remotely like the old fashioned spearmint licorice that we enjoyed as kids. Be warned.
2211	5	Most good preserves taste similarly to me--i.e., they all taste quite good.  It's a nice step up from Smucker's.  Get some good natural peanut butter and enjoy a lovely sandwich.
2212	5	Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup is excellent!  There isn't anything on the label that states that this is from anywhere else but Vermont...(some syrups that claim to be pure maple syrup also have labels that state that they may be a product of Canada or Vermont).  The price per oz. is about 81 cents and as I use at least one ounce on my waffles, this bottle will last for about 16 servings.  I will be buying this one again!
2213	5	After having to give up coffee, and really missing being able to sip a nice hot mug of java each morning, I found reviews for Teeccino. I bought first a small box of the  Tee Bags.  As soon as I opened the envelope, the smell was rich and wonderful. The prepared beverage was very good and I enjoyed it so much! So I ventured out again to get a bag of the  loose  grounds that you  brew  like you would coffee. Again, I was VERY pleased! I find the aroma and flavor to be very satisfying. Better than the  cold brew  coffee I had been trying to drink.<br /><br />I read some reviews likening this product to  Postum.  I found something like Postum at my health food store called  Kaffree Roma  which is made by Kellogg's. It is an instant beverage with similar ingredients to the Teeccino. So I tried that as well. I did not think it was quite as good as the Teeccino. The flavor of the Roma was a bit sesame-like.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Teeccino. It might not be exactly the same taste as coffee, but it really is close. And if you don't like one variety, try a different flavor. Also, one reviewer said the Teeccino was  bitter.  I have noticed this happened when I accidentally brewed mine too long. So if it's bitter, shorten your brew time.<br /><br />UPDATE, MAY 20, 2012:  I have been using the Teeccino for a few months now. I have absolutely no problems with my stomach when drinking it! Although we LOVE the other flavors as well (especially Vanilla Nut and Chocolate) we find that we still drink the French Roast most often. I have even gotten my husband to switch from coffee to Teeccino now!!<br /><br />Some tips for new Teeccino drinkers: After you decide which flavor you like best, utilize the  subscribe  option. You can get any flavor and YOU can pick how often you want an order; monthly, every 2 or 3 months, etc. It will save you a little bit on each bag and makes life easy since you don't forget to re-order.<br /><br />Also, we have prepared our Teeccino different ways; coffee pot, french press, Teeccino bags, etc. We have found that we prefer the Teeccino when prepared in a French Press. This method also seems to use WAY less Teeccino, making it an even better choice. For our press (which holds about 4 cups) we use 2 rounded Tbsp. of Teeccino. We have not experienced ANY bitterness preparing our  coffee  this way.
2214	2	I can typically tolerate any coffee but this stuff really I have to choke down. I always put it in my mug to take to class b/c I know I will get bored enough and drink it if it is in front of me. The caffeine does the trick but the taste is just off, it is sweetness and flavor gone wrong. I think a lot of it has to do with the smell, it smells terrible! It just tastes like bad coffee too begin with with awful vanilla syrup added to it. Wish I could return or get rid of my 50! :(
2215	4	Awesome for anyone with a gluten allergy,very good and flavorful! Mom has gluten sensitivity and loves to have Bakery on Main granola for breakfast or a snack with yogurt!
2216	4	I don't have a Keurig coffeemaker which I think this product is made for.  However I was able to simply cut the bags open and put them in my normal coffeemaker filter and make coffee that way.  I found that this coffee tastes slightly bitter to me, and not as hearty as the Java Delight coffee I have been used to.  I can't speak for other coffee drinkers though - I am not an aficionado of coffee.  All I know is what I like and perhaps you may have a different opinion.  Give it a try.
2217	1	I don't usually drink energy drinks and I stopped drinking caffeine a little over a year ago, but had a long drive and I was exhausted so decided to give this a try. It worked great for the first 2-3 hours. I had a boost in energy, was more alert and felt fine, but into the 3rd or 4th hour my heart started racing, broke out into a cold sweat and was horribly jittery. When I got home my head started spinning and I couldn't sit down for hours. It was the worst feeling ever. I seriously felt like I was overdosing on a drug. Finally after 7 hours I felt a little better and was finally able to fall asleep, but all into the next day I felt horrible, entire body ached, felt unrested and still jittery. I know not everyone will react the same way, but be careful with this stuff. I did a little research afterwards and found information that suggest it is possible to OD on caffeine and Vitamin B. Maybe the percentages in this drink were just too much for me.
2218	5	I never tasted Nutro Ultra Dry Puppy Food, but my dog is thriving on it. Sometimes I sprinkle some on the carpet and he thinks it's a treat. I put some in an empty soda bottle and spread peanut butter around the rim. Pappy, my puppy, says,  Buy Ultra. It's Ultra good! 
2219	2	its ok ..i was disappointed with the texture and strong smell. will try other brands - probably wont get this one again<br /><br />i bought in bulk because i have had this brand before and it was great..now i wish i could get rid of the overstock of hard to eat stinky fish jerky
2220	5	I am happy with the service of this company.  Fast shipping and great communication.  Also, the product helps keep my dogs teeth clean and breath smelling great.  My dog gets Greenies every night and reminds me at 8 PM that it is time for Greenies.
2221	2	I received the product very promptly and packed in a little cooler but the expiration date was 9/30/08 and I had just ordered it 9/22/08.  They need to watch that my husband wont eat anything out of date or even close to being out of date.  That was the only complaint.  Love the cheese!!!
2222	5	These organic breakfast pouches sell out FAST at the store, and with good reason!<br /><br />We love these breakfast pouches-- they are portable, sized perfectly for kiddo hands, and offer a perfect, wholesome start to the day. All organic with 100% natural ingredients, no pesticides, no chemical fertilizers, no genetic modifications, and no preservatives. The pouches themselves are are BPA and phthalate free.<br /><br />Each pouch holds a serving of organic fruit puree, natural yogurt and brown rice. The combination is tasty, satisfying, and gives kiddos a boost in the morning. We also occasionally use these as a  Dessert  at the end of the day.<br /><br />You will be happy with this purchase!
2223	5	My dog loves these treats. I wait until he is otherwise occupied and hide a few around the house and then tell him to go find them. He goes crazy and will hunt the entire house until he has found every last one!
2224	5	I need to get this spray for white flies and it seems to work. I know that I am not adding poison to my yard.
2225	5	I am not the review leaving type, but I do read them - therefore I must in good concience tell of my experience. This food is a life saver for my cocker. Our vet and the vet specialist suspected an allergy and he was on Hills ZD prescriptive food, the allergy manifested itself mainly with ear issues, not unusual in a Cocker but the ears went from normal difficult cocker ears to close to end disease ear canals with an ablation recommended. We did surgery to remove tumors in his ears, we tried expensive medication, he was still in pain.  Then, my vet ran out of the ZD. I looked around for another food and read about Orijen. We gave it a try, after two weeks the change was significant, his nose is no longer cracked and dry, his eyes no longer weep and his ears don't hurt him anymore!  They get better each day and I can only attribute it to this food. Try it, I am thrilled I did.
2226	1	It doesn't work out for me!  Everyone is different!  Only Durham's Royal Jelly works out good for me that I ordered it thru Amazon.com.  I use it for more eggs for my ovaries for 2-3 months.  It is great for pregnancy!
2227	5	As an aid to tranquility and sleep -- what it is marketed for -- it is not very effective.  But for chronic severe constipation it is the only thing that has worked for me.
2228	5	I'm from Singapore and have been drinking tea all my life. I've been drinking Dilmah for many, many years (in Singapore) and when I migrated to USA, I was lost without Dilmah. I wrote several emails to the President of Dilmah in Sri Lanka, asking them to sell their tea in USA. I paid expensive postage/handling, to get the tea shipped to me, directly from Sri Lanka.<br /><br />I was the happiest person on Planet Earth when they told me that Dilmah was available (online) in USA. I did request for a 100piece teabag packagings instead of 50pcs.....I guess....they may not have that kind of demand here in USA. I hope that they will consider sending 100pc per package..as it will be more cost saving, for customers like me.
2229	4	I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to  clean  before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.
2230	5	Sweet potato popchips are awesome!  They're a little like a kettle corn where you have the salty and the sweet.  Yummy!
2231	5	I got these for my 4-year-old, who had become familiar with fruit snacks, which are full of nothing but awful things. She loves them, and so do my husband and I. I don't feel guilty about giving her these as a treat.
2232	1	I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.<br />I think these popchips must be for  heath  type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.<br />We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.<br />After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.<br />They taste  hallow ,  empty , too artificial chemical taste.<br />With a regular potato chip I get the  that's it  sensation, satisfying, full flavor.
2233	5	Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have  that talk .  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!
2234	4	I really like the taste of these little cookies, and this is the best flavor (IMO).  I got these when they were marked down to $12 and felt like I was paying an OK price.  They have gone back up in price, so waiting for it to come back down so that I can buy more.
2235	2	These are a strange shape, and my dog couldn't quite figure out how to eat them.  We keep her lean, not feeding her much, and she always scarfs up any little molecule that happens to fall.  Not so with this.  She carried it around for a while, and then finally crunched it down.  Not the best treat.
2236	5	This product came on time from amazon. It is fresh & can be frozen for amonth or more to be used many different ways. Brazil nuts are a great way to help with urin flow in men with enlarged prostate.
2237	3	I don't understand why these are from China if the nuts are from California. What a waste and not a good idea in my mind. Huge carbon footprint. I'll buy other products at my co-op instead. Bummer
2238	3	I got this box as an experiment for use with a type of Pine Pellet litter. For anyone who uses pine pellet litter, we know it does wonders to get rid of tracking issues and smells great, but the urine breaks the pellets down into a soggy and smelly sawdust. I didn't want to buy the Feline Pine sifting box because it lacks a hood. My room mates have dogs who like to go after the  kitty crunchies , and having a hood greatly reduces odor and the unwanted sight of your beloved pet taking a deuce in the middle of your apartment's kitchen.<br /><br />Anyway, my thinking was I could fill this with the pellets and sift out the urine soaked sawdust while the pellets remained on top, and scoop the solid waste.<br /><br />Bad idea. The holes are JUST too big to keep the pellets from sifting through. So don't bother if you're thinking this is the miracle solution like I did.<br /><br />So I bit the bullet and bought a Breeze system, which I will be using with the pine pellets instead of the type that comes with it. I'm going to try and jerry rig the hood of this litter box on top of the Breeze which has similar measurements.<br /><br />God help me. God help us all.<br /><br />Update: The breeze system was a complete fail. I do not recommend it at all.
2239	5	This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite...Lady Grey.  I can only find this at my local Safeway, so was thrilled to see it on Amazon in a large quantity.
2240	4	This flavor is a very good one, though it is a bit stronger than the pomegranate lemonade that I preferred (until they stopped making it).  The first time you try it, it will likely seem to be very strong, but the tart flavor is very good.  Be careful not to spill it though, it will stain...and can even stain your hands.  I make sure to drink a sip out of my 16.9 oz water bottle before I pour in the powder to make it less likely that I will make a mess.<br /><br />Amazon also has a very good price on this.  I found the standard price to be far cheaper than a grocery store, and the subscribe and save price is even cheaper than that.
2241	4	I could not get this brand of jerky in local markets. They are delicious and I am glad Amazon carries it.<br />Johnson
2242	5	I've been buying this product for over 10 yrs.  It is a special<br />treat and reward for our dogs - I will continue buying this.
2243	5	I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.
2244	5	UPDATE 05-21-2012: Amazon hears and answers our packaging prayers.  Our last shipment was packed box-within-box with a double layer of bubble wrap around the inner box.  A few cans were slightly distorted from normal handling but not seriously dented and all 24 were perfectly usable.<br /><br />We've replaced canned tomato sauce in all of our favorite recipes with these ravishing red beauties from Italy and we're never going back.  Aside from being peeled and then pasteurized in the can, these San Marzano plum tomatoes are just about as fresh as when they were plucked off the vine in the Campania region of Italy.  That means they aren't cooked until you cook them, and what a difference THAT makes, especially with sauces simmered all day in a slow cooker or thrown together on the spur of the moment in a pressure cooker.<br /><br />Amazon.com's Free Super Saver shipping makes them a bargain compared to ordinary canned tomatoes and a steal versus the price of San Marzano tomatoes from the store.
2245	5	Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder is the most efficacious way I have found to get the amount of magnesium that my system requires.
2246	5	I have bought several bags at a supermarket and really enjoy them-  these are definitely better and more  snack-able  than standard cacao nibs since they are slightly sweetened.<br /><br />After eating a tablespoon I notice a slight buzz like from coffee or chocolate so this is a great way to satisfy chocolate cravings!
2247	1	OMG, I gave this to my 1 year old, 110 lab and he ran outside with it. I got distracted and when I went to check he had already eaten the entire thing. The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his  full  tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!! I've already lost my 14 year old lab in Sept and this one we got in Oct and he his my Angel!!! I would die if anything happened to him!!!
2248	1	The Cadbury Crunchie Bars was not packed properly.  No padding of any kind.  Bars crushed and a mess to eat.
2249	5	I have recently started using the Babycook, so I can't speak to it's reliability in a mechanical sense.  I don't know if it would withstand 'heavy' (daily) use, but it appears to be well-built with sturdy parts and works great so far.  It does exactly what it says it'll do.  here're some of my observations:<br />Pro's-<br />1. this machine steams veggies and fruits very well, you can leave it unattended and it'll shut off (although I still walk over and unplug it).  it takes about 15 minutes for sweet potatoes for example and about 10 (or less) for apples. They come out just the right consistency.<br />2. the machine is small and takes little counter space<br />3. it's very easy to operate (a minor gripe I have is that it takes a while to  click  everything into place, easy once you get used to it)<br />4. I found it faster to make baby food with Babycook vs. cooking veggies in a pot and transferring into a blender/food processor.<br />5. the size of it is just right; for small babies, it makes at least 4-5 servings of food.  I don't think it's small at all.  I find myself using it about every other day, if that - i make one type of food on sat, freeze leftovers and make something else on tues and/or wed- this will take me through most of the week, if i keep taking out frozen portions. Between peeling veggies, chopping, steaming and blending, it takes me about 25 min to make one type of food, but it lasts for a while.<br />6. reheating /defrosting is easy and quick, beats the Microwave.  I would suggest to purchase Beaba food containers and use them to reheat your food, they fit perfectly into the Babycook - or any small glass dish would do.<br />7. I think i'll keep using it as a blender/food processor after I no longer need steamed veggies pureed, it chopps up chicken and steak very well too.  So I'd estimate about a year's worth of use out of it, maybe longer.  In babyworld, that's a long time:)<br />Cons<br />8. cost - it's not cheap, although I found a better price elsewhere (see wayfair.com)<br />9. you have to transfer food out of a steaming container to the main container to blend, that's an extra step - as compared to Brezza, where you only use one container.<br /><br />PS - even though the main container is plastic, i found that carrots for example don't stain the plastic, it's held up well so far.
2250	5	Just as advertised in the selling add. The product arrived as specified and was packed well.<br />I have nothing else to add. Thank you.
2251	2	When I opened it from the box it looked okay. The the best but I think it will live. What I don't like it why is a cutting a piece of leaf? When I think of a cutting I would at least have a stem not just a leaf. I am not sure if it will root. I even ask my parents (who are good with plants) to help me plant them but we are not sure it will even grow. They should post up a picture of the cutting. I just planted it yesterday so I don't know if it will grow yet. If it doesn't grow I will be very disappointed because I order those as a gift.
2252	1	Even though the item says  Pack of 6,  I only received one. I called them up to see where the other 5 were, and they said that Amazon put it incorrectly. Seriously?? They are issuing a refund, but still. I wanted 6, which is what the item says, and instead and only getting the 1. Should we just not trust what's on Amazon now???
2253	5	I have loved popcorn since I was a kid but have always dreaded popcorn that is loaded with butter (e.g. movie theater popcorn)<br /><br />Not only is Newman's Own organic, it tastes exactly how I like it.  Not super buttery or salty, very light in flavour.  This is by far my favourite popcorn on the market!
2254	5	If you drink  pod  espresso, I think this product offers very good taste and value for the price.
2255	5	I have been enjoying this product for some time.  I buy it at Wegmans grocery store, I believe the cost is under $4.00 a box.  If you like black licorice you will love this product.
2256	5	Great quality.  I tried to order more on my subscribe and save but it was not available.  My kids dont want to wait 2 months for next shipment.<br /><br />UPDATE: ups delivered our monthly worms.  The kids answered the door and opened immediately.  All of the worms were completely melted.  Its monday and i bet they sat in a truck over the weekend where our tempshave been hitting 100f the past 6 days.  In june the worms arrived in goodcondition.  I guess that we will need to skip orders until the fall or when it cools down.
2257	3	Got a bag with a few bad ones in it. They were really bitter. Overall they taste about right. I've had better organic almonds, That cost more. The texture is perfect.
2258	1	I ordered this as it is the food I always use and pay $52 for the large bag, didn't realize I was getting the small 4.4 lb bag.  This is not a deal.  It is higher than I pay at the pet store!
2259	5	My husband and I sent my mother-in-law this fruit basket and she was thrilled.  She's diabetic and loves sweets, so it really helps when she has something to satisfy her sweet tooth.
2260	5	I bought these terrific little treats not because I needed something to fill a sugar/sweet craving while dieting but, because I was looking for something yummy that would be somewhat  healthy  yet still be able to satisfy my cravings for chocolate! These little gems are PERFECT for only 100 calories per bar with 6 grams of protein & 6 grams of fiber!<br /><br />They're not super sugary sweet nor, do they taste like cardboard like some of those carb energy bars that you can buy at your local gym or GNC. Yuck!<br /><br />These bars do seem quite small at first (3¼ inches long) but, because of it's soft chewy almond nougat (it's NOT chewy like taffy-like as one reviewer had stated) and the peices of almonds throughout; coated in luscious, rich dark chocolate; you'll find yourself chewing more slowly; savoring each bite! My sweet cravings were truly satisfied after taking my time to enjoy South Beach Diet's- Whipped Chocolate Almond Snack Bars!<br /><br />If you're looking for a sweet & healthy alternative to satisfy a craving,  these will do the trick! If you're dieting & need something to help get you through the day until dinner, these bars are sure to fill that desire for something sweet & provide enough carbs, fiber & protien to get you there!<br /><br />These bars ARE a bit on the expensive side but if you compare them to what you'd normally pay for a candy bar, the price is right!
2261	5	Item was exactly what I wanted.  The price was very reasonable and I received it in a timely manner.  I was impressed with the auto-ship option--very useful for an item like this.
2262	4	This is the first set of K-cups I've bought, and it was because they came highly recommended and I love Hazelnut coffee.  These won't disappoint.
2263	1	The product that I purchased was soggy and greasy like it had been in the sun for awhile. It also tasted like it was rotten meat product. There is no use by or best by date on the package so I do not know how old it is either. I do not recommend this product.
2264	5	She loves these - would eat them all day if I didn't stop her! I think they taste very similar to non GF granola bars - they are a bit tougher, not as mushy, as others, but still good.  My daughter has been GF for 5 years, so she really has nothing to compare them too. These are one of the few GF foods her brothers would steal from her (if I didn't stop THEM). Because they are so expensive, they are not allowed to eat them, only my GF girl.
2265	5	Colorado honey is mild and not too sweet.  It's smooth and has a great mellow flavor.  I eat it on toast, waffles, and use for sweetening coffee and tea.  I'll never go back to supermarket honey.  This is a great gift idea too.  It's something different and everyone loves the taste.
2266	1	i purchased this product to kill algae and  moss on a small part of my shingle roof and my brick patio.i used the product at four different intervals.the results were very poor,the same moss and algae are still there.i followed the directions on the leaflet attached to the hose end bottle, it also says it is hazardous to humans and animals. i absolutely do not reccomend this product because the results make no difference from the original condition when i applied it  dave d
2267	3	I have used NSA Nesquik in my coffee for YEARS. It dissolves completely in the hot fluid and tastes great. I can't tell the difference from the fully sugared product.<br /><br />I was looking to buy it in bulk, since it is a staple in my house. None that I found qualifies for Super Saver Shipping.<br /><br />When considering the cost of shipping it is about two dollars MORE per container than even the local Albertson's. Anything under $5/unit would be worth it. Walmart sells it for about $4.75.<br /><br />Bottom line...Keep an eye out, but watch those shipping costs!
2268	5	A wonderful smooth green tea with a nice hint of mint! No sweetening required. Excellent on a warm summers day or any day for that matter.
2269	4	One of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one.  Almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting.
2270	5	THE TIKI CAT FOOD IS EXCELLENT.  ALL MY CATS LOVE THIS FRESH SEAFOOD CAT FOOD.  THEY FINISH IT TO THE LAST BITE, IT WAKES UP THEIR APPETITES AND IS NUTRITIOUS FOR THEM ALSO.  YOU CAN SEE THE FRESH SEAFOOD IN THE CAN, AND I PLAN TO BUY MORE AND TRY THE OTHER VARITIES OF THE TIKI CAT FOOD.
2271	5	This oil is wonderful to add to cookies, cakes (and cake mixes), frostings, shakes, and many more places. I have used it with confectionary sugar and made a lovely icing for scones. It is strong, so add just a few drops at a time until the flavor is to your liking.
2272	4	I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands.
2273	2	I am a HUGE Godiva chocolate fan, so you can imagine how thrilled I was to find these for my coffee maker. Unfortunately these really disappointed me as far as the flavor goes. It's very strong, and just doesn't live up to what I would expect from Godiva.
2274	5	I was amazed at how well these cleaned my dogs teeth. He is not happy with getting his teeth brushed, especially in the back, the Greenies have assisted with cleaning this hard to reach area. I have read other reviews where people have had trouble with their dogs trying to chew off too much and choking or what-ever - my solution stay with your dog as they chew anything this is just plain common sense. I also give it after his evening meal so that he won't try to swallow to big of bites.
2275	2	I always buy the Dingo brand mini bones. My dog loves them. She gets one after dinner every night. I never let her have a rawhide bone unless someone is with her. My Vet told me that I should give my dog these instead because they help reduce plaque build up on the teeth. The Vet even gave us one of the larger size strips. My dog did enjoy it and had no problem chewing and swallowing it. I found these on Amazon at such a good price, I ordered a bag for medium dogs. After chewing on one for a short time she started swallowing a large piece, choking on it, throwing it up and then starting over again. I took most of it away from her, but she still had a small piece that seemed to be a bit stuck in her thought and it took her a while to get down. She was fine; I didn't have to rush her to the vet butafter this experience, I will never give her these again.  We are back to the Dingo mini bones.
2276	5	I bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much I bought the 48 pack.  Great deal on Amazon.
2277	3	As the title of the review lays out, I've had better, but I have no complaints. Personally, for my home, the FiberOne bars are a staple. Then for a switch of pace, my sons love Nature Valley's Peanut bars. However, if nutritional value is your concern, you would be better served with Larabars. They not only have a more suitable nutritional value, but they also have more appealing flavors.
2278	4	Octavia Japanese Genmaicha (green)has always been a favorite of mine.  This package had much greener dried tea leaves, took longer to brew<br />and seemed to contain less tea.  I transferred the tea to another container and cannot identify the tin it came from, next one I open I will keep the container.
2279	4	I think I first heard about Mallomars from Babysitters Club books when I was a kid. Maybe they were one of the foods Claudia stashed in her room? She was always eating brand name junk food my mother wouldn't buy me. So I was really looking forward to these cookies. If a fictional character from my childhood loved them, they have to be delicious, right?<br /><br />I did not love these cookies at first bite. They seemed dry and I didn't like that the chocolate was a thin hard shell. I also wasn't remotely hungry when I first tried them. Although I really did like the marshmallow. Also, the packaging isn't very storage friendly. But I figure that's what tupperware and plastic bags are for.<br /><br />Then I came home from work one night, hungry. They were pretty satisfying, and the more I ate the more I loved that the outer shell of chocolate was crisp. Now I only have two left. I think I'll go eat them right now...
2280	5	This is my favorite coffee to brew on a daily basis.  Very hard to find the large decafs in the store now.  It is smooth and has a great flavor.  We drink a pot every morning.
2281	4	I discovered the KIND fruit & nut bars recently.  This is my favorite, good taste and texture, but tends to get very hard if a bit stale.  Nevertheless, I would recommend, especially for someone gluten-free, in which case there aren't enough options.
2282	2	i was looking forward o trying this product...but it tasted really chemical and plastic...very disappointing!
2283	5	Best taco seasoning ever!!!!!!! Can't find in wal-mart, meijers, publix, and Kroger. So finally decided to seek it out online. Great stuff to have for a family night of tacos.
2284	4	Its an awesome, healthy day starter! I like to mix in a little greek yougurt and some dried cranberries. But make sure you use the big bowl! I have yet to make it in the microwave without it overflowing my bowl during heating!
2285	5	These are so delicious.They are so smooth and rich without being overwhelmed by spice.I hate to have to buy a whole case,as it is just me.But they are so good ,it just might be worth it.
2286	5	The other review (entitled 'Fruit and Branch Mangler) is dishonest. The reviewer wrote negative things about ALL the fruit pickers except his. In fact he has written countless negative reviews of MANY different products. He is a dishonest marketer who is gaming amazon for purely selfish reasons.<br /><br />I don't know a THING about this fruit picker, but I feel an obligation to go to places where the reviewer has done his damage to warn people that the review he wrote can't possibly be true.
2287	1	I just finished making a huge batch of buttercream frosting using my typical recipe, I tasted the untinted version and was satisfied.  Unfortunately for me I did not do a small test amount before applying this Christmas Red to the entire batch - it has completely spoilt the frosting, leaving it with a harsh, very unpleasant after taste.  I have purchased cakes from Costco in the past and have learned to avoid anything that has red frosting as I get the exact same taste.  I also did not find this to be anywhere close to a Christmas red, perhaps I did not use enough, but given the resulting taste having only achieved a pinkish red, I can only imagine what a horrible tasting mess you would be left with if you tried to achieve a real red - my frosting ended up being inedible!
2288	5	We found these at Costco and fell in love with them.  They're SO GOOD...and they're actually good for you.  Since I couldn't find them at Costco the past couple of times I went there, I searched online and found them on Amazon.  Funny...after I ordered them I now see them at my local grocery store chain (Ralph's)...and even on the flight I took across the country last month (United Airlines).  However, I'm still glad I ordered a big box of them because we go through them pretty fast.  :)
2289	1	The title is all that needs to be said.  It's not Dragon well.  I've had dragon well before and this isn't it.
2290	5	I have bought this Stash Ginger Peach Green Tea in bulk several times now and really enjoy the taste each time ( slowly converted myself from black Earl Grey to flavored green teas (don't like the green Earl Grey) and herbal drinks. This  tea is my tasty morning treat.
2291	5	I love Zuke's products and these bones are no exception.  They are safe and natural, and with a dog on a restricted diet I love that all the ingredients are easily found.
2292	1	not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.
2293	5	By far, these are the best tasting of the Special K Protein Meal Bars. The chocolate peanut butter bars don't have that weird protein aftertaste and it is almost like eating a candybar. I usually have one for breakfast and it seems to curb the appetite until lunchtime. Great product and great price when using Subscribe and Save.
2294	5	I love a cup of bold black tea to start off my day.  Twinings English Breakfast K-cups fit that bill perfectly.  They are stronger than traditional tea bags and have a nice bold flavor.
2295	1	The new recipe is horrible!<br />Don't buy it, force them to bring the old ones back!<br />And yes, Amazon - change the picture to reflect the change.
2296	5	My daughter (10 mos) loves this, and does a pretty good job of feeding this to herself with minimal mess.  We give this to our 2.5 year old son as well when we eat out and don't have a good option of fruits/veggies.  And actually, my husband thinks it's pretty good too :)  Awesome that the only ingredients are carrots and apples.  Awesome.
2297	1	I can't taste any salt on these almonds.  I'm sure that makes them healthier, but YUCK!  I need my sodium fix and these don't cut it.
2298	5	This vanilla latte is really good for a protein drink!  I have mixed it with the water and the milk.  The milk makes a nice rich flavor hot drink...really good.  The water is good also.  Have not tried it cold.  I have found that when you mix it (using the container with the ball) and let it set for a few (15 or so) then shake again it have a really good flavor.  I highly recommend it.  (I am a very, very picky protein drinker)
2299	5	I love this full body tea! Be sure to brew for only 3 minutes for a most satisfying taste. Take time to relax with a cup of White Orchard tea - sip slowly and who knows, visions of summer peach orchards may visit your senses!
2300	3	I used to buy this tea to an African store for $3 dollars and I drank it once a week but there came a time that d pain was just unbearable.The cramps felt like an abortion when wrong.Willing to give it another try.
2301	5	I'm not a writer enough to detail the tastes, flavors, bouquets, etc., but this coffee is GREAT!  I like it so much, I'll wait for it.  I'll wait to get home to brew a freshly ground pot in a french press, rather than stop for a to-go cup at a brand name coffee shop.  I drink more coffee now, this coffee, than I ever have.  Probably not a good thing, but not all bad either, and a testament to the coffee.  A fresh pot for guests always elicits  ..what kind of coffee is this? It's delicious.  comments.<br /><br />I've tried three of the Cafe Altura organic coffees, this is my favorite.  It prompted my to try the others.  The French Roast would be my second favorite, and then the Peruvian.<br /><br />It's a Subscribe & Save item for me.
2302	4	My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24 >Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.
2303	5	This is a great tasting and wholesome snack.  The quality is excellent.  Whole natural ingredients that satisfy.  I buy these in bulk.
2304	5	This is the greatest 'hot' pepper sauce you'll ever find to put on your sub.  In SE Penna, and northern Del., sporting some of the best hoagie and sub shops in the country, when those hot little Italian counter girls look across the board at you and say,  You want peppers?,  and you nod affirmative, and they respond,  Hot or sweet?,  this is what they're talking about.  No sub, especially an Italian, is complete without Wickles' sub sauce.
2305	5	This is by far my favorite flavor in the K-Cups! I'm ordering more to freeze so that it will last me until next season!
2306	2	Do you like the taste of artificial sweetener and generic fruitiness?<br /><br />If yes, try this product.<br /><br />If no, stay well away.<br /><br />Despite the claims of tea, honey, strawberry, and acai on the front of the box, it's the ingredients list that gives away the true flavors. Malic acid, maltodextrin, and sucralose are pretty much the only things my tongue registered. I think you'd have to be a professional food taster with an incredibly refined set of taste buds to recognize any hint of green tea or honey.<br /><br />What i really can't grasp is why they bothered putting any real sugar in this in the first place. Why not make it 0 calorie and skip the sugar entirely, instead of putting the 10 calories (per packet, which is two servings, hence 'only 5 calories per serving!') in with no effect whatsoever on the taste of the product.<br /><br />And worse yet, if they're going to grossly oversweeten it, why not use a zero-calorie sweetener like stevia that doesn't taste like a chemical factory exploded on your tongue?<br /><br />People who consume enough fake sugar that they've lost the negative reaction to the chemical aftertaste of those products will probably find this product pleasantly sweet and fruity. Everyone else, well, just don't buy this.
2307	5	A friend and I who prefer our hot chocolate unsweetened had a cocoa testing. We bought five cocoas, all but one organic and at least one fair trade. Then we each lined up five cups, added half and half to the five cocoas, and sipped. We both agreed that Green and Black was the best by far.
2308	1	Unfortunately, all six packages that arrived were within one week of their expiration date, and all six packages of cereal were rancid.  To its credit, Amazon refunded the total price for the product.  We were very disappointed because we have been great fans of the Mesa Sunrise Cereal, which we have previously purchased from the local grocery stores.  Perhaps Amazon could somehow list the expiration dates of the product(s) before listing them on its website.
2309	5	This is the best brown rice we've ever found.<br />It was discontinued at the grocery stores in our area, but it is (still) available from amazon.com.  When our Pack of 6 is gone, we'll certainly re-order.<br />Highly recommended !
2310	5	My son loves these pretzels!  They are one of his favorite snacks.  They are very crisp and tasty.
2311	5	These little packets have everything you need to make commercial-quality popcorn.  Two pouches in each packet:  one with popcorn and flavored salt (flavacol, or something just like it), and one with that bright orange oil (solid at room temperature).  The yellow color, the flavor and the salt all find their way into the popcorn.  If you like the  butter  stuff they squirt on at the theater, that's a separate purchase.  You might want to consult your doctor.<br /><br />The 2.5 oz. packets are made for the baby-sized commercial-style machines, and they produce a smallish batch, about enough for one person.  I got one of these for Christmas, and now I wish I got a bigger model, at least a 4-oz. popper.  The little tub loses too many kernels during popping.  Plus, the small size makes it tough to clean and load the tub.  Anyway, the popcorn is great.  If you are an occasional popcorn eater, these packets are incredibly handy.  If you make a few batches a week, though, you might want to invest in a big tub of the oil and a box of flavacol, which should save money in the long run.
2312	5	My dogs love it, even the little princess terrier.  I've tried many other brands and they enjoy this one the most as so far.
2313	5	This dressing is fantastic, I mix it with red wine vinegar, sunflower oil and eat it over a garden salad or pasta salad. It is the best, this will make sure that you eat your daily vegetables. You can't get enough with this dressing. I love it.
2314	5	Wasn't sure how this coffee would be but it is excellent. Nice and bold without being bitter. Not as bold as say the Big Easy, Emeril coffee, or Sumatran, but still plenty of taste.
2315	5	You can't go wrong with this soup. All you need to add is 2 cans of tomatoes, a onion and 1 lb. of sausage. I recommend turkey sausage. The lentils and seasoning is included. The seasoning is what makes it great. It's just a little spicy. I make a box every 2 weeks. Makes a great gift too.
2316	5	This coffee tastes amazing!  I like the individual serving size, very conventient for a 'fast dash' morning coffee for on the way to work.  It has a very complex flavor, is smooth, not too strong.  Make sure you steep it long enough to get the full flavor.
2317	5	My hubby and I really like Starbucks Via! We make up one packet and split it - ends up being two full glasses. It comes out to be the same price as an iced coffee at McDonald's (usually cheaper for us because we buy these on sale/clearance and stock up). Plus, we can make these up whenever we want. We usually add in some skim milk and shake it up in our martini shaker, then pour over ice. Done!
2318	5	I really do use this mix as an all-purpose gluten free mix. I love it! I am gluten free, though my family is not, and they love it too. I have used it for waffles, pancakes, cookies, muffins, and breading for frying chicken. Actually, I use it pretty much anywhere a recipe calls for regular flour and it works very well. I like this better than Pamela's Amazing Bread mix, which I tried using as an all purpose mix and found it didn't work as well in that capacity. I highly recommend this product.
2319	5	I ordered this product because of the great value that it offered.  For what grocery stores were charging for one box, I was able to get two.  I never thought I'd be buying things like cereal off of Amazon but their prices and value cannot be beat!
2320	5	El Yucateco Green Habanero is my favorite hot sauce. It is not vinegary, so, while it does have a subtle flavor, it is an excellent choice if you only want to make foods spicy without noticeably changing their already pleasing flavor. For instance, this sauce is fabulous on a good grilled hamburger, barbecue and spaghetti. Let me warn you, though. I only put 3 to 4 drops of it on a burger. You go splashing it all over supper and you'd better have a plan B. The good news is that a bottle of it lasts a long time.
2321	2	bought in June/11 and expires in October/11.<br />they just look like old stock.<br />i just never shop at store expires in  a few month. i do not like them!!
2322	5	My dog goes nuts for these treats.  I like them because they are pocket friendly, are easily broken into smaller pieces, and are made in the USA.
2323	2	Taste is personal opinion - having said that I've had a lot of mochas over the years and this one doesn't stack up very well.  It taste like a cheap chocolate drink.  I like K cups but can't recommend this one.
2324	5	If you like Kahlua this is a great coffee.  The aroma is wonderful as it brews and the flavor is mild - not overpowering.
2325	5	Not too long ago, our daughter arrived at our house after a year away from home with bags full of clothes that were full of moths. To this day, she rejects that notion that she brought such a scourge to our family home, but the facts speak for themselves. The day before our daughter arrived home, there was not a moth to be found. The day after she landed and unceremoniously dumped her bags in the front hall closet, I opened the door to that same closet and turned on the light only to be met by the frantic flutterings of a newly arrived population of moths that were scurrying as quickly as their little dusty wings could take them into the dark corners, away from my dropped jaw and curses. I took action immediately. First, I closed the door, hoping for containment. Second, I gently scolded my daughter with the reminder that, unlike her, we actually enjoyed the pleasure of a clean, vermin-free home. Third, I went online to check out the relative safety of the more toxic insecticides such as  moth crystals  that kill everything--adults, larva, and eggs. Fourth, I decided that I could not seal the hall closet tightly enough to prevent toxic fumes of the conventional insecticides from entering our living space; Fifth, I searched for safer alternatives and found...you guessed it...Safer Brand 7270 Clothes Moth Alert Trap. I read the mixed reviews for Safer Brand. Many were promising, but some were halfhearted. Having wrestled with all manner of crawling interlopers in my home (lice, fleas, etc.), I concluded that the less enthusiastic reviews were most likely a result of user error or, at the very least, the purchaser's own lack of diligence in follow through after correctly applying the product. I, on the other hand, am one of those classic obsessive compulsive types who takes on a challenge like this with the determination of a marathon runner (make that  triathlete ). My husband would smirk at such an analogy since the only experience I have that even approximates exercise is the vigorous typing I do on my computer; but, hey, one finds analogies where one can, right? So, on with the story. After reading the instructions and carefully positioning about three traps in every closet of my home, I also followed up with a thorough vacuuming of each closet and put the more seductive wool/silk items into thick, black, plastic bags (the kind you get at the hardware store that are usually called  Contractor's Bags ). I also installed a third tier of defense by placing a few bowls of cedar balls in each closet. Finally, I left one small wool scrap hanging in each closet to lure the moths. I am nothing if not devious. Then, I waited. In fact, I was gone for several weeks on vacation, and when I returned, much moth activity had occurred. The verdict? The traps worked wonderfully when combined with my other  moth attack  measures. The corpses of dead, desiccated moths littered the traps. There were no holes or visible eggs on the wool  lure,  but I disposed of those scraps just to be safe. Then, I continued to search for moths in the less accessible parts of the closet--higher up on the walls, in the seams between carpet and baseboard, and in all the ceiling corners. I found no moth activity. I replaced the first batch of traps with a second round after a few months, and I continue to have zero moths to this day. End of story.
2326	5	I've been buying the diet black cherry and diet cola for a few years now. Both are fantastic but the black cherry is one of the better diet sodas I've tasted.  In addition to the taste, I don't mind my children drinking it either--they love them--because there's no caffeine and it's without all of the artificial ingredients that are in traditional sodas. Great price on Amazon too.
2327	2	Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that.
2328	5	This is great, makes grilling just about full proof. You set desired temp and it will alert you. Absolute love it and would recommend to all.
2329	5	...and has lots of stuff in it.  If you want something good w/o many calories that has good taste buy this.  The <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZO2 >Healthy Choice Chicken with Rice Soup, 14-Ounce Microwave Bowls (Pack of 12)</a> tastes like a chemical spill but the noodle version is excellent.  I just got it because it was a nice easy cheap lunch but it turned out to be really good.
2330	5	Tree arrived shrink-wrapped and strapped to the bottom of a large box filled with packing (very impressive packing).  The tree was healthy and the soil was still moist, if anything it had too much soil.  I took a fork and scooped out a good bit of soil so as not to have a huge mound around the trunk of the tree.<br /><br />The picture shows a blue tray, but mine was brown, but for me that worked better with my office's color scheme.  I added some baby tears to the soil as a ground cover and to keep the soil wetter.<br /><br />I didn't notice any leaves dropping like others have reported, don't believe the reviews that are two years old, maybe the trees were poor quality back then but the one I got is great.
2331	3	Nothing spectacular here. Unlike the other reviewers, I found mine fairly salty. I think I'll try other brands before considering buying this again.
2332	5	I sent these as Christmas gifts to family members who had spent time in Spain this past year.  They had loved Spanish cheeses so were very pleased with the gift.
2333	5	Have now tried all Auguri oils (Basil, Lemon & Orange) and they are wonderful.  All these oils are good to saute, marinate or drizzle on fish, chicken, beef or salads.  I particular like the Lemon on salads with a splash of white vinegar - yummy.  Try them with confidence and enjoy the unique flavors.
2334	5	I had a hard time trying to find a peppermint tea that was organic till I found this. Way better than non-organic.
2335	5	Last year was my first summer living in Oregon in a neighborhood with many Black Tail Deer. As a test I designated one spot in my front yard and planted many different kinds of annuals, some which  they  say the deer won't eat. The deer ate them all. Then I started spraying them with Deer Off, and it turned into a colorful and beautiful garden. It rains a lot here and when it does not rain we have a sprinkler system that sprays the garden heavily. I sprayed the Deer Off once or twice a week. This year I actually had the nerve to plant a rose bush there. My first bottle ran out, so I am buying a new one. I think it works!
2336	1	Every single one of my twelve cans were BADLY dented. This is a TOTAL waste of coins. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
2337	5	So much better than Kikkoman Low Sodium soy sauce.  This has a slightly sweeter and less salty taste.  Definitely worth the extra cost.
2338	1	My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. She's been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled?
2339	4	The height of the dried shiitake mushrooms inside of the jar was substantially lower than the height of the dried shiitake mushrooms pictured in the photo.  This means either that:  (1)I did not receive 12oz of dried shiitake mushrooms as I should have, or (2)I did receive 12oz of dried shiitake mushrooms but the photo is fraudulent in depicting a height of dried shiitake mushrooms that is substantially higher than Amazon.com customers will actually receive.  The printed label on the outside of the jar has also changed, becoming a little less attractive than what is pictured in the photo.  The dried shiitake mushrooms inside of the jar are adequately good.  They are smaller in diameter than the dried shiitake mushrooms in most other brands.  I strongly urge Roland to install a tamper-evident seal on the top of the jar for this product.  This would help to prevent people from conveniently  taking a sample  of dried shiitake mushrooms, leaving less mushrooms for the paying customer.  I only received enough dried shiitake mushrooms to reach the 55% level in the height of Roland's jar.  Roland's photo of this product shows the dried shiitake mushrooms reaching the 85% level in the height of the jar.
2340	5	We had been eating the Glutino regular pretzels for a few years now and they were okay, but recently our health food store started carrying these.  I bought a bag and we enjoyed them so much I was back buying a few more.  Pretzels are one thing I've missed since going gf - but not any more!  Taste great with dip, too!
2341	5	I ordered this to use in my popcorn machine.  I was uneasy about how the kettle would handle this product, but since I have a great kettle cleaner I went ahead and ordered it.  I am sure glad that I did because this is FABULOUS!  It leaves no mess in the kettle at all.  When it starts to pop the first kernels that come out are the best coated ones and then as more pop they get less coated, but if you mix them all together I think you get great flavor.  Just remember this is a sticky coating when it first comes out so unpopped kernels stick to the popped ones so watch out for those.  Still a great tasting product that I will keep purchasing...
2342	4	Being a Weight Watchers Lifetime member, Nestle's fat-free hot cocoa is my favorite!  But I could only find it at one grocery store near me, and they weren't even consistent about having it.  I'm so glad Amazon has it, in bulk, and cheaper than my grocery!
2343	4	I use this product very often, as I try to eat mostly vegetarian. This is great to use as the liquid for cooking rice, pasta and all kinds of vegetable soups. So convenient to order a case and have it delivered to my home.
2344	3	This was really tasty when we first got it and opened the bag, but the flavor degraded into nothing within a week.
2345	5	This medium strength coffee has a rich, full bodied, pure coffee flavor.<br />And the single cup serving pods couldn't be more convenient.<br /><br />With many family's becoming more health conscious,<br />this organicly grown coffee is just the kind of product thats needed.<br /><br />We found this coffee to be wonderfully aromatic while brewing.<br />The 100% Arabica beans make a delicious cup of coffee,<br />which gave a definite pick-me-up with-out jitters or an unwanted after taste.<br />Our family thinks this is a five star coffee!
2346	5	This is the cheapest I've found this and it has great protein/fiber content. You must dump it all into zip locks after the initial opening, but that is fine since the price is right.
2347	5	I love white corn, in all its forms, including popcorn. And I hate how outrageously expensive the kernels are in the supermarket, so I love this popcorn.
2348	5	If you are looking for a sweet, try this cookie.  It is extra light<br />and has a nice crunch to it.  I buy these cookies by the carton.<br />They last for one month between my husband and I.  He likes cookies<br />with his morning coffee.  We are both satisfied with these cookies.<br />Would buy them again and again.<br /><br />Mary
2349	5	My mother really liked these as a birthday present. The box they come in is also lovely.
2350	5	It was exactly what we needed.  family member was to travel to<br />China.  Took coffee so he could have his coffee everyday.  He said it as a taste from home.
2351	5	Where to start -- shipping was quite fast, the size of the bag (3 lb) is good. I divided it as the labeling recommends (2 lbs in the freezer, 1 lb in the fridge for daily use.) I've made a couple smoothies with it so far and it's not unpleasant-tasting. It doesn't really taste  great  by itself (but you're probably not going to eat it by itself, are you?) but it's definitely in no way unpleasant. Another reviewer mentioned mixing it with rice milk, and I support the idea that mixing this hemp powder with a sweetened soy/rice/nut milk product would definitely be palatable, and a simple way to take this as a supplement.<br /><br />Not much else to say. It's a good product for a reasonable price, if you're into this sort of thing. Quality-wise I can easily recommend this Nutiva product. :)
2352	1	This product is a poor performer. I threw it out. It couldn't shock me even if I wet my hand before grabbing the fence. I bought a Gallagher Wrangler and it works beautifully to charge our electric poultry netting.
2353	5	With a cat that had to have a special diet housed with 3 other cats that did not, this product worked out perfectly. They all like it so I could keep feeding free choice as I had done before. All showed improvement as well but especially the cat that required it. Excellent size for my feeding demands. I am getting ready to order again.
2354	1	Holy barf bag, the jalapeno Popchips are FOUL. I love the original Popchips and I really love Jalapeno, but for some reason the Popchips people just couldn't get the flavor right. I tried one, gagged, and handed the bag off to my dad to try. He was munching cautiously when I mentioned I thought they tasted a bit like garbage. He paused, considered, and said,  That's it. That's the taste. There's something gym-socky about it.  Save your money!
2355	5	My wife and I enjoy this coffee. It is not to sweet nor does it have an over<br />bearing coffee taste, or after taste.
2356	1	Although this is advertized as the exact Atkins recipe (Hope MIlls bought the right to make it from Atkins), it is not.  Very bland, very tough waffles and pancakes.  What a rip-off!
2357	5	Both of my large breed dogs love Canidae.  I actually have to limit how much they can eat or they will make themselves sick by eating so much!  The ingredients are wonderful and actually contains stuff I would eat myself.  I would recommend this food for any animal lover.
2358	4	My dog loves them.  I have cut them into smaller pieces and she will chew for quite a while to finish one off.  I still don't know if it helps her digestion but she sure loves them.
2359	4	Smokehouse USA 100% Natural Meaty Porky Bone 8 Inch Dog Treats, 5 Pack Bag (Purchased on 10/2011)<br />by SmokeHouse<br />QUICK MAILING/ GOOD PRICES/GOOD PRODUCT VALUE
2360	5	Really like the price and the package of the Kcup filter vs plastic.  We really like the flavor also.  We will continue to purchase.
2361	5	Great candy bar. Shipped as expected. Factory sealed. I'd advise getting to the mailbox soon after they are delivered in case they melt though.
2362	5	WE visited Agen, France where these prunes are made. The region is famous for Armagnac, rugby and prunes---and Favols prunes are from that region. I try to get them shipped to the USA when available. Have them in the morning or drop one into a sniffer of armagnac or cognac. Best in the world. bh
2363	5	I buy Kind bars to stash in my pocket book or bike bag. I am an avid cyclist and need nutrition on the go. I LOVE the variety of Kind bars and I also feel like I am getting to crunch and chew a lot. I am also Gluten Free and Kind products are GF.<br /><br />I have been eating KIND bars for 4 years now (maybe more) consistantly and recommend to others all the time.<br /><br />Give them a try, but word of warning - you might get addicted too!
2364	4	Taste great cold! Not so good room tempErature. It's cheaper by the case especially since it's hard to find in stores.
2365	5	It is great they finally offer this product.  None of the stores in my area carry the decaf coffee bags.  I am a very happy customer. : )
2366	5	I can not believe how quick I got them and they are delicious and came in two separately packed boxes, all cold. The strawberries were just picked and refrigerated, they are as fresh as can be.<br /><br />Great offer ..
2367	5	I prefer dog litter to pee pads. This product works great for my pup & I love that it is more economical & not as environmmentally wasteful as pee pads. It absorbs odors extremely well & I only need to clean & replace the litter once every 7 -10 days!
2368	5	This is easily the best oatmeal out there.  We won't eat anything else.  It really gives oatmeal a whole new taste.  It doesn't have a mushy texture but a very chewy texture and I highly recommend it.
2369	5	These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.
2370	1	The name of this flavor sounds fantastic, and I wondered why they didn't include them in their multi-flavor assortment. Then I tasted them. These chips are terrible, there is no parmesan flavor to speak of, and they somehow messed up the garlic as well. Avoid these and the also-no-incuded-assortment flavor of  jalapeno . Very disappointed.<br /><br />The cheddar, vinegar & salt and peppered flavors are FANTASTIC!
2371	5	Instead of Simple Solution Lamb & Rice I was sent Simple Lamb & Oatmeal but, my dog likes it. Next time I will make sure I am sent the right food. I didn't know until I had open and put the food in my 10lb container.
2372	5	This is an edit so I was unable to change my star rating.  At first I was happy with this canned cat food until the trouble began.  It has caused severe diarrhea in both of my cats who were eating it.  Now I'm in the process of trying to get things back on track.  As anyone who has been in this situation knows, the negative impacts of the situation affect the entire household, not just the poor cats who are suffering from it.
2373	5	the dog food came quickly, and for my labrador, who has food allergies, it is excellent, as it contains no corn, wheat or other grain products. Service was fast and efficient, arrived as promised.
2374	5	I was looking for a decaf coffee that wasn't bitter, smooth and flavored. This one met all three criteria. Very nice blend. Just wish these cups cost less.
2375	5	This was my first K-cup coffee and it was great.  I am a Starbucks Americano or Sumatra drinker by nature and like rich, dark coffee.  I use this all the time in my office now.  Had tried Starbucks VIA, also a really good product, but this is less expensive and just as good.  It's definitely cut my costs but not my pleasure in coffee.
2376	1	In addition to the labelled content, the following items were found: cockleburs, peanut shells, pieces of yarn, twigs...and many of the flowers showed evidence of mold.
2377	5	This concentrated cranberry tastes great when diluted with water. Add some Stevia for sweetness without adding any calories or toxic chemicals. Comparing the Amazon price over the health food store...very affordable! Great for bladder and urinary tract health.
2378	4	This was the first loose leaf tea I ever tried, the directions said a teaspoon for the cup and one for the pot, it may be too much.  A teaspoon of this tea expands to about a quarter of a cup of leaf.  I really enjoyed this and for my two teaspoons made about six cups of tea.  The tea has a nice flavor that I usually do not locate in green teas.  It has as described earlier a smoky quality to it that gives your mouth a taste of the green tea that lasts but doesn't disturb.  I have enjoyed using this in my teapot and adding water through the day until I wear the leaves thin.  If you like green tea try this.  I enjoy it with honey and milk.
2379	5	Crispy (even in milk!) and deliciously filling after a morning run... does life get any better than this? Thanks for making life a bit easier to be healthy on the go with a wholesome cereal with protein, vitamins, and roughage to keep us all energized to bring out the athletes in us. :-} Looking forward to new products!
2380	4	First off I want to say I have been nothing but happy with this formula for my baby!!! I had always used Similac in the past for my two first children but with the resent recall I decided to try something else for my third. My cousin had used Earth's Best Organic Formula for her baby and had been very happy with it so it was a brand I was familiar with. It also seemed only natural to go with an organic formula since the rest of our household drinks organic milk. I saw that Amazon had it on sale making it cheaper than other brands with the free shipping. This brings me to what I'm unhappy about...<br />Sadly my little guy gave up breast feeding rather abruptly forcing me to turn to bottle feeding. I tried pumping but he was plowing through my supple faster then I could produce it so I ordered this formula from Amazon. I signed up for their new amazon-mom program which allowed me to get free second day shipping (which was how fast I needed it). 3 days after ordering it I got an email (from amazon, not ups) saying the shipment had been delayed and it should arrive 3 days later ... over a week and a half later the package finally arrived. I was pretty upset because this forced me to go to our local store to by other formula which is very pricey since I live on an island. Amazon offered no apology or compensation for the extremely late package. Sadly this is not the first time I've run into this problem with Amazon not shipping things when they say they will, and items arriving far past when they  guaranty  they will. I think I've finally had enough though and learned my lesson not to order from Amazon if you want anything in a reasonable amount of time. Diapers.com has the same product, free shipping and their orders get here when they say they will!<br /><br />All in all GREAT product, I highly recommend it! DON'T order it through Amazon thought!!!
2381	1	I just attempted to use this product for baking a couple of days ago and was so very dissappointed.  I have used a few different brands of Date Sugar and have never had a clumping problem.  I believe most of the companies who produce date sugar have to cut some oat flour into it so it doesn't just form one sticky lump.  This is how Bob's Red Mill Date Sugar is...one big 24-oz block of sticky lump.  I had to pound and pound on the mound of date sugar and attempt to whittle away at it with a knife.  I thought I had pulverized it enough to bake with it and boy was I wrong.  When I poured the batter into loaf pans, it had big red clumps of date sugar poking out of the batter.  I picked out what lumps were visible but when I cut into the finished product, it had patches throughout that were sticky and felt like the bread was not done.  I could tell these patches were from the clumps of date sugar.  I was so very sad I bought this product.
2382	4	I really liked this frosting. It tastes really yummy, and I love that it's natural. I made a really nice Thomas the train cake with it for my son's birthday this week. :-)<br /><br />I was disappointed a biy by the  dots , though. They had been the main reason that I ordered this specific frosting at this time (I wanted something colorful for the birthday) but I tried them and didn't like the taste at all. I ended up coloring the frosting with natural food colors and left the dots off completely. Next time I'll probably order colored Sprinkelz instead, they're also natural, and maybe they'll taste better. But the frosting itself is great.
2383	3	The title of my review says it all (as long as it didn't get cut off). These have a lot more air in them than the Gerber Little Crunchies. These crush extremely easily and get dust/crumbs all over the place. Also, they do not taste nearly as good as the Gerber Little Crunchies. They might be better for you, and I like that it has a hint of veggies in it, but my 17 month old isn't very happy with them. She'll snack on them if that's her only option and she's really hungry, but she definitely will not choose them. We first got these several months ago and she's had the same reaction to them every time since then.
2384	5	Safflower oil is very good for you as it is high in Linoleic Acid, which among other things, helps get rid of some of the belly fat. It is tasteless and easy to swallow by itself or put it on salads or anything you are cooking.
2385	5	My cats really like tuna and chicken chuckles.  It's a great grain free option for cats who like fish-flavored foods.  Switching my cats to grain-free has helped tremendously with their  tummy  issues.
2386	5	I am so grateful Starbucks started making ready brew. It tastes amazing and I carry them everywhere. VIA is perfect for morning classes when I oversleep and don't have time to make myself a cup. I just ask my campus coffee cart for a cup of hot water on my way to class and voila instant hot, fresh brewed coffee. I can't understand why anyone would give this product a poor review, compared to other instants it is a rockstar.
2387	5	doesnt make me feel sick or bad after using this salt, unlike most other regular table salt ,sodium chloride types of salt or even the sea salt.<br />seems to be a great quality product.
2388	5	I find this coffee to be very pleasant with very little bitterness or acidity. Since it comes in individual pouches, much like a tea bag, the result is perfectly filtered. There are brewing machines that take such pouches, but I just put it on the bottom of a cup and pour boiling water over it. By adjusting the amount of time that you let it steep, you can regulate the flavor. Most experts suggest only a few minutes, similar to the amount of time a drip method would take. More than that is considered over-extraction that may result in more bitterness and other changes, but it is a matter of personal preference. The foil packs also keep each pod very fresh. It is also very convenient to take to work with you since it is so simple to brew.
2389	4	This is good quality, strong black tea. The tin is smaller than you'd expect, but each one does hold a full 1/4 pound because the tea is so finely cut. I can't imagine drinking it without milk, and in fact I blend it with Darjeeling for a somewhat milder taste, but all in all, good value for the price.
2390	5	My 2 year old Shih Tzu boy loves this food.  I mix it along with Health Extensions so he has the benefit of both types and flavors of foods.  He was typically a poor eater, but now just  woofs  it down!
2391	1	I bought this to help me sleep because of the tons of great reviews. I couldn't get down more than a sip. I didn't expect it to be great, but it was down right unbearable. It's impossible for me to take. Huge waste of money,
2392	5	This sauce is as promised.  Hot & Tasty!  My son puts it on everything, even his spaghetti.  The size of the bottle is bigger than most, so it last longer.
2393	5	This coffee is rich and flavorful without being too strong or bitter. It's smooth and well balanced and the flavor is just perfect. I followed the instructions on the bag; two level tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water and made it in my drip coffee maker. It's probably the best coffee I've had in a long time. I will definitely be buying this brand again.
2394	4	Best deal for the quantity of Oolong tea out there.  Maybe not as favorable as some other brands, but honestly, at the advertised price, you can use twice as much and still be better off than most of the competitors.  I recommend it and will order again.
2395	5	If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
2396	4	This version is ground.  NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others.
2397	2	I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.
2398	1	I'm sorry, but who in their right mind is going to pay 5.99 plus 7 dollars shipping for one 41/2 oz puch of baby food? Get real!!!
2399	5	I LOVED THIS COFFEE. I just got my order a few days ago and I normally drink just one cup of coffee in the morning......Now I can't wait and have had an afternoon cup, too. I must say....I look forward to getting up in the morning just because I know I'm having this coffee!! TAHT SAYS A LOT FOR A LTE SLEEPER!! Try this one!! I like it on thenext to highest setting on my Keurig....it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth, never bitter and there is something that 'hints' of a slight fruitiness with the first sips......then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew, too. Never any aftertaste or bitterness. I am so happy to have found this!! Thanks Wolfgang! I have now ALL of your kitchen gadgets cookware and now the coffee too!
2400	4	Extreme ginger flavor, with a hint of lime and sweetened with cane sugar -- Cock n' Bull ginger beer is an eye opening ginger soda that leaves a slight burning sensation in the back of the throat.  if you like ginger beer, then you'll probably enjoy this beverage.  There's a recipe on the side of the bottle for an alcoholic beverage known as the  Moscow Mule.   I'm looking forward to trying it!<br /><br />** Slogan on the bottle of Cock n' Bull ginger beer.
2401	4	I have tried several of the Timothy's coffee's as part of the initial variety pack which came with the Keurig brewer.  I tend to use the 10oz brew and add a bit of creamer or flavored creamer to my cup of coffee, but I always try to taste the coffee itself before doctoring it to my taste.  This was a very good cup, I prefer a medium to dark coffee, and usually drink a moderately strong french roast at work.  This was the best of the non flavored coffees, Timothy's or otherwise which I have tried so far (coffee people french roast is a 3 star, Newman's extra Bold and Timothy's Nicaragua extra bold are both very good but a little strong for my taste)  If you like a medium coffee that is smooth and flavors nicely with a creamer give this one a try.
2402	5	Great product .Enhances flavor of vegetables , strengthens chicken flavor in soup , gravies , sauces , etc. And a big plus , low sodium in this case , means low sodium .<br />Have used it for years and hope Amazon keeps stocking it because they are only source I can locate .
2403	4	Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.
2404	5	I know cats are very individual, and usually are pretty finicky, but this flavor canned (& dry) cat food is the only kind my cats prefer. I've even tried other flavors of Natural Balance in the canned, and they turn up their noses most of the time. I switched to the Limited Ingredient Duck & Green Pea formula after my older cat showed signs of food allergies. Since they've been on this food, her allergies have improved.
2405	5	This was very good coffee, enjoy the pod style coffee makers the best. Quick and easy no mess to clean up after.
2406	5	This is good stuff. It reminds me of the tea in an Indian restaurant. This has no added vanilla flavor. A previous brand I bought had vanilla but did not mention it. If you drink this kind of tea, this is what to get.
2407	5	These bars are THE BEST! They are my go-to bar whether it be for a quick breakfast or a guilt free snack. Tasty and filling and the extra protein is a bonus. Try them but be forwarned.......they become a craving quickly.
2408	5	I have used Instant Breakfast for many years.  I really like that it is quick and easy for busy mornings.  Used to purchase it at a Sam's or Costco in little packets, but I think that the canister version has a MUCH better taste.  Would love to see the dark chocolate version in the canister....
2409	5	I can almost hear the dogs yelling 'treats' when this cannister comes out. All the dogs absolutely love these treats!
2410	5	I actually got this for my cat! And she loved it!!! For a week.... ha<br /><br />Well I was amazed that she was interested in it at all but now I've got a whole lot of pumpkin on my hands.<br /><br />It looks, smells, tastes like the real deal and I'm excited to learn how to make pumpkin pies ;)<br /><br />I would definitely order again (only I already have 11.5 cans ;)
2411	4	This is the real deal.  I douse it with unsweetened soy milk, and chew it up prior to my coffee so I'm only half awake at the time.  If at least one of my meals is healthy, and more than palatable, good deal.<br /><br />Forget the unsweetened claims, there's plenty of dried fruit.  But otherwise, as a low-fat, high fiber, burn-some-calories-chewing food, it does good.  I don't soak it long enough, so it is gnarly to chew up, especially when I need to eat fast to catch the bus - an adventure in the morning!<br /><br />Why does the label claim servings are an ounce?  That would make these 10 lbs last 160 breakfasts, I'm sure my serving is 4X bigger.<br /><br />If I want something tastier, however, I recommend the granola from Oat Cuisine of Alameda, CA - nicely brown, crunchy, and not too sweet, which can be ordered from their web page.
2412	3	I happen to love the smell of this on me, though it reacts badly with some others' body chemistry, as is to be expected with most scented things.<br />I've found that the  dry  line from Axe isn't the greatest. The deodorants are flaky on the skin, and don't do their job for very long - for me it's maybe a few hours, though might get up to 6-8 hours if I'm not too hot that day. I recommend going with the  fresh  line instead.
2413	5	After learning about the importance of eating your seeds, nuts and legumes sprouted, I began looking for alternatives and found that Go Raw makes them and Amazon offers them at an affordable price. The Go Raw pumpkin seeds have all the good points you should look for: 1.they are organic, 2.they are raw, 3.they are sprouted, 4.they don't haves any unnecessary ingredients added, except sea salt, which makes them gluten, wheat and soy free, 5.and they taste delicious, which makes my 7 year old son want to eat them as a snack. The company is family owned and they source the seeds from local growers.
2414	1	Product is good but the service is xxxxx .... no update shipment info, still not receive the goods after 3 weeks, I can understand it's holiday season, but i received other products what i purchased on the same day and they did ship out from the east coast.
2415	5	My picky cat loves Wellness cat food. He will eat the pouches but he prefers the can style cat food. However, either one will work...my cat digs Wellness cat food.
2416	5	Love this coffee!  It is my everyday go to coffee when I want plain, non-flavored coffee.  I actually use one k-cup to make a medium and a small in a large coffee cup.  I find this strength perfect.  Amazon has the best price and I love the packaging of the 50-count package.  Recycle the one box--very little waste!
2417	5	Our Senseo coffee machine was given to us as a house warming gift, and we have loved from the first time we used it!  The dark roast coffee pods seem to taste so much better than any other brand or flavor I have ever made from home.  The dark roast blend is simply the best. It is smooth, rich, and brews so quickly in our new machine, it's fantastic.  I suggest using stevia powder as a natural (and chemical free!) sweetener with this blend, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ >30 Grams (1.06 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  I don't even use cream anymore, no kidding!
2418	1	My dog seems to be allergic to poultry so we thought we would switch him to this lamb-based formula.  Usually he is a good eater, but my dog had one smell of this stuff and wouldn't come back.  I understand Wellness puts higher-end ingredients in their food but if a dog doesn't like it there goes your money right down the drain.
2419	5	These are delicious , ever since trying them i have recommended them to other people and they buy it and they tell people and they buy them too,,,,sooooo good!:)
2420	4	I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter, it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter, but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories, I consider it worth it.
2421	5	Every day is Thanksgiving at Sophie and Sam's dinner mat when they receive their Whiskas Turkey and Giblets in gravy.  They are quick to devour it and clean each other right after eating (I know they hope to pick up a piece hidden in the fur!).  I only buy from Amazon because of their awesome prices!
2422	3	this product does only get 3 stars from me a bit over priced and not any better than other less priced coffee not that the coffee is bad its not but i would expect more from starbucks does not have that starbucks flavor some thing is lacking with this coffee im not sure if i would buy it again starbucks needs to lower the price a bit on this coffee and go back to the drawing board and try and inprove it
2423	4	I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a puppy.
2424	3	This harissa is pretty good.  But it is way behind Mustapha's harrisa in terms of flavor.  But right now, you cant seem to get Mustapha's online.  So this is definitely the next best option.
2425	3	Of the four different flavors of the Lipton beverage mixes that I've tried this one had the best flavor. It sounds weird to mix these 2 flavors but since neither one is actually what they tried for it didn't come out too bad. But, it still has the same problem that the other Lipton mixes have. It doesn't dissolve very well and no matter how much you shake it there's still some chunks in the bottom of the bottle.<br />  On the plus side, since I started trying the various powder single beverage mixes a couple of months ago, I've dropped a little over 25 pounds. Even though I did like the flavor of this one, for the price of it compared to the other brands available, I doubt that I will ever buy it again.
2426	5	I first tasted Pommery Mustard at a party in New York City, many years ago.<br />The Crock had been purchased from the world-famous  Zabars .<br />Instantly, I was hooked!<br />Finding my favorite mustard on Long Island has always been a problem.<br />The only store that carried it in East Hampton has long since closed.<br />How convenient it is that AMAZON carries it!<br />Try heating some of this stuff up with a Ham Steak and some butter.<br />You will be hooked, too!!!!
2427	1	At one point it is called a  3 Pack, 5.0-Ounce Container  and at another it is called a  A single 5-ounce container . There is a lot of info about the creators but no info about what spices are used !
2428	5	I got this mix after being on low-carb diet for a few months. I baked bread and it came out very nice looking and tasting. I was happy that now I could have a slice of this bread with my morning coffee. But could not enjoy it enough as my kids liked it so much they just eat it all. We always have a supply of cookies and sweets at home but they preferred my low-carb blueberry bread.
2429	1	Bought from Costco. It was one box with two bags inside. Both bags tasted different from each other. One bag tasted normal and the other tasted like it had artificial sweeteners. I won't be able to trust big brand cereals from now on. I used to love these so I used to get them all the time. Now I have to look for something else.
2430	5	All-time favorite Pirate's Booty flavor!  Wish I could find it in stores near me; I've looked everywhere but can only find it online.
2431	4	No complaints about the chips, they're great. However the box arrived from UPS half open and when I opened it completely, I found one chip bag had exploded and all the other 23 bags were crushed or semi-crushed. So much for that! Not blaming Amazon or UPS but next time this happens, I will return the order.
2432	5	I first tasted Dilmah 5 years ago at a luxury hotel in Singapore.<br />The bouquet, taste and after-taste of the tea were superb.<br />I was reminded of the Darjeeling tea I had tasted at the London home of an Indian diplomat over 30 years ago.<br />Of course the two are quite different teas, but their subtlety is rarely found in mass-market products.<br /><br />Dilmah tea is not a  bold  tea - so don't expect a PG Tips kick or the almost as robust Typhoo taste (both teas top their class).<br />In fact, I prefer my morning Dilmah brew with only about half a teaspoon of leaves steeped for 6 to 8 minutes in freshly boiled filtered water. It brings out the deeper flavors of the leaves. (P.S. - preheat the cup)<br />Later in the day, a full teaspoon brewed for a shorter time hits the spot.<br />I am enjoying this worldly indulgence while it still pleases, for my meditations keep taking me to a place where desire is absent and the Silence of being reigns.
2433	5	Pros:<br /><br />1.  Great for packing lunch as an alternative to water and juice.  No refrigeration required.<br />2.  About $1 per carton, relatively cheap giving the convenience it provides.<br />3.  Tastes better than the Horizon brand for organic milk.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  About six months expiration.  Will have to rotate stock if stocking up for emergency.<br />2.  Too convenient for the kids.  Kids go for it instead of the gallons even when at home.
2434	1	I expected these to be crunchy.  They were chewy, tough, salty and fishing.  I was very dissapointed.  Gross, would never buy again.
2435	5	The Gimborn Liver Treats are by far my dogs favorite treat.  The are a wonderful training reward.  Very good quality.  Just beware your dog will sniff them out from wherever they are hidden in your pockets.
2436	5	Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel.<br />I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff. Its taste is pleasant and it is easy for an on the go status like what I was.<br />I recommend this to anyone who has a lot on their plate, especially if it is temporary and you aren't used to dealing with it all on a regular basis. That kind of stress can lead to a meltdown! I usually get sick with a really bad cold or such within a week of being back in my own environment but this time I did not. I wonder....well, I didn't have as much stress knocking my immune system down to germ take over levels maybe. Either way, I like it and I am a gonna keep it! In fact, I am going home again in 3 days....Calm, don't fail me now! :D
2437	5	Of all the gluten free foods I have had to eat lately, these are actually really good. I will definitely be buying these again
2438	5	My baby LOVED the Ella's kitchen items, especially the peaches & bananas.  I love that it is all organic!  The consistency is very runny...so it mixes well with things like oatmeal & other baby cereals.  The cap will go back on the package, but must be kept upright in the fridge or it will leak.
2439	1	Drinking this will give a positive on a drug test. Beware! A friend from Chili gave me some, but I found out that this is not for people who have to do drug tests.
2440	5	These sesame seeds are delicious. I used them to make tahini which we eat on crackers or use in hummus. It was easy to make and came out a hundred times better than store bought AND cost pennies in comparison. Will buy this product again when we run out.
2441	5	I brought this tea a year ago, I was looking for something to help me relax and thought I would give it a try.  I've been drinking it ever since, it's better then sleepy time and I enjoy the flavor.  I let my Mother's nurse and Sister try it and now my Sister and I order it together.  We love it
2442	5	Soooo good, and not crumbly like a lot of the more wholesome brands of rice cakes. I wish Amazon would keep a larger stock of the multigrain and flax flavor of corn thins.
2443	5	The cashew cookie bar is one of the best bars i have ever eaten, especially when you look at the ingredients. It is all natural with no preservatives. you cannot make a better tasting, better for you bar. I eat these on my long runs on the weekends and they seem to sustain my energy very well. The flavors i have liked the best, of the ones i have tired, are cashew cookie, cinnamon roll, apple pie, and gingersnap.
2444	3	This was the first time I had tried Kind Bars and thought the Macadamia and Apricot would be a good one from the reviews. I liked them ok but I didn't find them amazing. I also didn't like that they have soy lecithin in them. I will stick with Larabar.
2445	1	Neither of my dogs nor any of their dog friends--male or female--showed the slightest interest in the posts. I put them in places they had used in the past. No go.
2446	5	I was surprised by just how good this rice is.  A little chewy [much better than mushy], good flavor, and oh so convenient for the gluten intolerant. When I don't have time to pack lunch, having one of these in my desk drawer can save my day. Adding a little protein to it makes it a quick easy meal. The price is a bit much for every day use, but it would be great also for taking on trips, as a GF safety net.
2447	5	i didn't realize that these pods actually brew a bigger (not watered down) cup o' joe.  i'm a big fan first thing in the morning, when i tend to prefer two cups of coffee.  this seems to be the perfect compromise!  i think it's 12oz vs the normal 8oz.
2448	1	My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.  Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because  it's good for the cats and they love it . Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to  fatten her up  with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.
2449	5	I am very happy with Amazon service including the speedy shipment. I am also very happy the product Amazon is carrying. This product is only available in selected specialty stores in the area. And tend to be expensive. Sometime they only carry small selection in store. You have to wait long time for a special order. Amazon is making the product available with a wide selection of variaty and affortable. Thanks.
2450	5	The dried cranberries (like the cherries) are great. I always think I have too many and give a bunch away to my friends, family, neighbors and co-workers. Everybody is very pleased to have them and I'm kind of a hero. :-)<br /><br />The cranberries have a great flavor and texture. I toss them in everything salads, oatmeal, cookies, chocolate, trail mix, muffins or just by themselves.
2451	1	What exactly is  an imitation blueberry anyway? I bought this thinking it was dried blueberries, but after tasting it, I  thought I'd better take a closer look at the box. If you enjoy real blueberries, you will know immediately that something is wrong. The box does say clearly it has  imitation blueberries  in it. It's nothing short of awful, with a fake blueberry extract throughout the pancake, so you can't even pick out the  blueberries  from the pancake.  No one in my family would eat these.
2452	5	LOVE 'em!  Easier to serve from a jar than those flat cans.<br />Buy some!<br />  ---------J. Lehman
2453	5	This is the best Dark roast coffee that I have found so far. I only wish that it was available as subscribe and save option so I didn't have to re-order it every Month.
2454	5	I found these cookies quite by accident after being recently diagnosed with IBS.  I'm always on the lookout for low fat foods that are flavorful. How a cookie that's low fat, low sodium and zero cholesterol could be so good is beyond me. I love these cookies!
2455	5	Great idea, however i just bought these at Whole foods for about $5 so i was surprised to see this price on amazon.
2456	4	This seasoning has excellent flavour and heat. The only thing is there is sometimes some grittiness which can be avoided by mixing it into a little warm water before adding to the pot.
2457	5	I bought a bag of the turkey and duck treats to use during obedience training for my German Shepherd puppy.  She loves these treats and really responds to them.  These treats have a strong smoky smell that makes them very appealing.  I had a hard time training my puppy the  come  command until I started using Wellness treats.  Now she runs right to me because the treat is worth it!  Because the treats are expensive, I break each into about 4 or 6 little pieces.
2458	3	I like the cherries much better but these were good in trailmix but again pricey.  I think the government needs to give healthy product producers the tax breaks so people can afford to eat healthy and tax the companies that make the crap food.  Sorry, just venting.
2459	5	I bought this gift for my 3 year old nephew who absolutely loves the wizard of oz.. this was the first present he opened and didnt open anything else! he played with this for over an hour filling all the characters! Awesome gift!
2460	5	I know this will seem weird to most people but I really, really like the flavor of buckwheat. This is why I tried this cereal when it was on sale at Whole Foods (not cheap at $3.50/box but still better than the current Amazon.com price).<br />Frankly, I expected to be disappointed by a very mild buckwheat flavor, but this was not the case. The flavor is bold, and this cereal is now by far my favorite. Unlike a previous reviewer, I could (and do) eat this cereal every morning--but, of course, it is because of my bizarre penchant for the unique nutty flavor of buckwheat. If, like me, you really like buckwheat, this is YOUR cereal. (Oh, and, yes, it is very crunchy and stands up nicely to sitting around in your choice of milk for a while, unlike many other cereals.)
2461	5	These lollipops are great - I put them out at my desk at work and people love the flavors and the fact that they are flavored naturally.  great product!
2462	1	These little sticks of chalk are not what I used to have... They literally taste like Pepto-Bismal...Which is fine, I suppose, if you really like Pepto Bismal.
2463	5	Bice Wholesalers stepped in and refunded my money for an error that I made.  They are quick, courteous and took care of my issue without question.  Thank you!
2464	5	This is a delicious snack for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike! we love them when we go hiking, camping, biking or just hangin' out and needing a good high protien snack!
2465	2	Like the other 2 reviewers, my son (13 months) is not picky! I actually call him my  champion , cause he has never refused any food...except this! The smell of garlic was the first thing I noticed when I opened the pouch, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. Yeah, nope! I did get him to eat it, cause like I said, he's a champ...but it took FOREVER!! Then I put him down for a nap, and when I went in to get him, his whole room REEKED of garlic! The garlic was so strong, even his poop smelled like garlic! Thats when I knew we wouldnt be trying that one again!<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because he did eventually eat the entire pouch, and we love all the other recipes...but this one needs some adjustments!
2466	5	Having never sampled this flavor, I took a chance and ordered a 2 pack because it sounded so delicious.  I'm happy to say I made the right choice.  It's an excellent combination of chocolate and raspberry, where one flavor does not overpower the other.  It's my new favorite K-cup, and I will definitely buy more when this supply runs out!
2467	5	Order arrived on time and in great condition (no squished box).  First time trying this flavor of their product, YUMMY!  Have lots of water on hand, spicy!
2468	5	I have a beautiful golden Bengal cat who loves Iams.  I have fed her Iams since she was 8 weeks old.  Bengals are known for their appetities and playing.  My Bengal will not eat any other kind of cat food.  I feel very, very secure knowing she is eating the best.
2469	2	I was really excited to try these out as salt & vinegar has always been my favorite flavor. I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice.
2470	5	We've tried other fruit-flavored xylitol gums, cuz my kids don't like mint....  This one wins the flavor prize.
2471	1	I was so hoping that the other reviews were wrong and these wouldn't taste burnt. But, allas they are a dark dark brown color and 95% of the 2 bags i opened were brunt and nasty. Amazon was GREAT though. They refunded the money and I will give them to the food shelf.
2472	5	My dog has never stopped loving these treats for over a year.<br /><br />Service was great and shipping was prompt.
2473	5	If you use this sweetener, you may have noticed that it is now rarely available at the big box grocery stores but is available on Amazon. In this case, the price was right, delivery was prompt and shipping did not double the cost.
2474	5	Great on chicken wings, steak (surprise) and pork.  Have to try on fish next.  Love this dry rub.  Be sure to purchase the 24oz size or you will be buying again after your first two BBQs.
2475	5	I find this cereal product of high quality and taste. I had previously found it at a local health food store and was delighted to find it on Amazon at a much better price per box. thanks, Drenn
2476	5	There are two kinds of tea: Twinings, and all others. Twinings English Breakfast Tea has a welcoming aroma and flavor that sets it apart from wannabee competitors.<br /><br />Amazon's price is amazing, which worked out to slightly less than 11 cents per tea bag. The next best price I've seen recently was closer to 15 cents at a DoD Commissary, with LA-area stores routinely in the 19-20 cent/bag range. My order was nicely packaged and arrived within 2 days of ordering. This is Extreme Value.
2477	3	As the description says: this is for single-serve  pod  type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee. Keep that in mind...<br /><br />Now, to the coffee: it was good in a 6-8oz brew, with the flavors being pretty much as described. However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less.
2478	5	I made these for a gluten-free friend after she broke her ankle. After she tasted them, she professed her undying love for me and these brownies. I tried them too - they were wonderful! Very rich and chocolatey without the chalky taste gluten-free baked goods have sometimes. I highly recommend this brownie mix!
2479	5	I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...
2480	5	My husband and I both really enjoy the taste of this coffee.  I tend to like a full robust flavor, and my husband likes his coffee on the milder side, but this coffee satisfies us both.  It is 'just right'!
2481	3	This tea taste good but the bags break super fast causing tea leafs to be in the tea even if the water is not super hot this still happens. Need better bags!
2482	5	Ordered this pasta from Amazon and it was received promptly.  I like thick spaghetti, but beware, this is really, really thick.  I really like it, but it's a little too much for my wife.
2483	4	The oats are thick, crunchy, have a nice texture with very few hull pieces, and make for good oatmeal. There isn't much more that can be said. This is the cornerstone of a healthy breakfast.
2484	5	This is a great product.  If you dislike plain water, as I do, you'll find this item makes drinking water a breeze.  It is also good as a sweetner for coffee or tea.  While I like Vanilla Creme best, all the flavors are excellent.  It is really just a question of preferred taste.  I also enjoyed chocolate raspberry and english toffee.
2485	5	PRO: Gluten free!<br /><br />PRO: Most delicious pancake mix I've ever used.<br /><br />CON: Bag is not resealable.<br /><br />FYI: Besides the mix, the ingredients needed are eggs, oil, and water.
2486	5	Most delicious dried mango I have ever eaten! It is sooo sweet and delicious that I read the bag several times to make sure there was no added sugar. Sundried, nothiing added- can't get any better than that!
2487	5	The wife eats all the black jelly beans so I bought enough for both of us.
2488	5	The item arrived in perfect shape and all ready for my children's stockings.  Thanks for the speedy service!
2489	5	I basically grew up eating fresh Caspian sturgeon and caviar, until it became scarce in 1980's.  Hence, I have first-hand knowledge of what the real stuff should look and taste like.<br /><br />This arrives neatly packaged in bubble/cardboard, in glass jars with metal lids, and label states it's a product of Island.  Shipping did not take long, only about 5 business days.<br /><br />The taste and smell is unbelievably the very same taste/smell of the real thing.  Texture is nice and pops, although quite a bit smaller than real stuff.  Overall, try the old Russian method of eating this:  Nice, firm slice of freshly baked white bread spread with butter - then thinly spread this caviar all over it.  This is the way we've always ate it, and the experience is unbeatable.  The worst thing you can do is put this on a dry, salty cracker.  Or, eat it in any other way for that matter.<br /><br />I ordered two jars at once and paid the same shipping, so it was $5 per jar.  I am planning to order a lot more, probably 5 jars at a time.  Supermarket sells real Osetra (sturgeon) caviar at $80 per 1.5 oz!!!!  American caviar at $45 for 3oz!!!  Come on guys, this is no rocket science - this stuff is the way to go.  From now on, I'm totally sold and a loyal customer!
2490	5	Arrived in just a few days.  I have a Soda Stream and do not care the Soda-Stream Syrups.  I found this Sarsaparilla Syrup while looking for alternatives.<br />Recipe for Sarsaparilla in the Soda Stream: Fill water up to the fill line of the Soda Stream bottle and carbonate the water as you would for any soda.  Using a measuring cup, remove 4 ounces of the carbonated water and discard. Measure 5 ounces of the Fee Brothers Sarsaparilla syrup, and slowly pour into the Soda Stream bottle. I always tilt the bottle so the water does not fizz up when the syrup hits.  Screw on the Soda Stream bottle cap and gently mix up.  I think the Sarsaparilla tastes best when refrigerated and served over ice!
2491	5	Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The melon flavor reviewed here has a very unique taste. Think honeydew more than watermelon, sweet and light with that distinctive Ramune lemon-lime backbone flavor holding everything together. Truly a treat.<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended. Pricing at an Asian market should run in the $7.99 to $8.99 range for a six-pack.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.
2492	5	I am definately hooked on this fudge and now that I am about to make my 3rd order, I am so grateful that you all ship to APO.  This is the highlight of my day when this package arrives here in Afghanistan.  Thanks again!
2493	5	Illy makes the best espresso roast coffee.  I don't usually buy ground coffee, but this is great for my rushed mornings.  Works perfect with a Bialetti stove top espresso/cappuccino maker.  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A8C0XW >Bialetti Mukka Express Cappuccino Maker, Polished Aluminum</a>
2494	5	Great truffle flavor!  Strong aroma, and good flavor.  Everything you are looking for in black truffle salt.  If you don't like truffles this isn't for you.  It's funky stuff!
2495	3	I must have somehow  missed  that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.
2496	5	These have minty chocolate in them, but it's not too minty, wich is good.  They're a lot like the Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies in reguard to flavor, but the texture is lighter and crisper.
2497	5	This is a great product to help with insomnia.  Really great.  Some do not like the smell or taste, but I actually love it.  Maybe it is an acquired test.  A+++ for this product, it is excellent.
2498	1	I used Similac with my first two children (one full time formula, second as a supplement). I intended on using this organic formulation with my third, until I did more research. Similac chooses to use cheaper quality ingredients i.e cane sugar instead of lactose in this formula. It's the  cheap  way of making infant milk, although the product isn't cheap. Babies love it because it's loaded with extra, actual sugar instead of milk lactose similar to what is in breastmilk. Sadly, this formula is one of those scams by companies trying to get a piece of the green hype. Check out other brands instead. Earth's Best offers a better organic option for your child.
2499	5	I also left a review on the beef base.<br /><br />It is a very clean chicken flavor.  It is very inexpensive when compared to purchasing cans/boxes of broth.  (I also used my Amazon Credit Card Points and Super Saver Shipping.)<br /><br />I will be using it in soups and more but today I made fried rice.<br /><br />I put a small amount in the water for the rice, with just a bit of soy sauce.<br /><br />Used just a bit in a small amount of the water I used to cook up the mixed veggies.  I added a clove of garlic and a little chopped onion.<br /><br />I poached chicken in a small amount of water with a little soy sauce.<br /><br />In a big pan with hot oil I added all the ingredients and stirred a couple minutes.  I then added 2 scrambled eggs.<br /><br />For something like this I never use measures, it is to taste.<br /><br />I made an extra big batch and froze it.  Yes, rice freezes as long as it is not reconstituted rice which I am not even sure what that is.<br /><br />Next time I make beef and brocolli with nuts using the beef paste.
2500	5	I was surprised by how much I loved this shampoo. It is, after all, just shampoo. That said, the lather is very rich and the smell is fantastic. Has a hint of a berry smell. My hair always feels great after use. I am switching my brand!
2501	4	Tastes good. After being sent the wrong flavor, they resent the correct one, so I'm pleased. Return policy is good also.
2502	5	My son has developmental delays, and these little puffs help with his fine motor skills. AND they taste good! I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save and get 6 cans at a time. It saves me from running to the store to get them every week. They are also cheaper from Amazon with this program. The sweet potato flavor is sweet, but not too sweet. We've also tried the banana which has a  real  taste to it, rather than an artificial one.
2503	3	This gum is too hard and the flavor is good but doesn't last long. I wanted to try it because it doesn't have any artificial sugar. Not sure if I would buy it again.
2504	5	My granddaughter bought my Keurig Brewer and it came with a huge box of various coffee's. I enjoyed them all, however im not the dark coffee lover. I do not like that sour, acid taste you get from some coffee as an after taste left in your mouth. This Nantucket Blend of Green Mountain is excellent and never leaves that undesirable after taste. I do like Neuman's Extra Bold, but its not my number one choice.  With this coffee you loose none of your flavor from adding cream. I just love it and its that one little extra I do for me....hope you enjoy.
2505	4	I recently adopted a kitten just under a year old. At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat.
2506	5	I'm a flight attendant, and this is one of my favorite meals to bring with me on trips.  Healthy, flavorful, and easy to prepare (just heat).  Excellent stuff.
2507	5	I love this stuff. At first, the taste left me with a funny face, but I got used to it and now crave it every morning. My aunt recommended it to me and she gives it to her kids for cold symptoms and allergies, and it works for them. I found that it helped clear up my face a bit, too. I can't promise it will do the same for you as various reviews can tell you, but I found my acne came down to a more controllable level, making it easier to maintain my few breakouts. The honey isn't a a solution for every cold, allergy, or acne breakout, but in my case, it certainly helps a lot.
2508	5	One of my little dogs was starting to get bad breath.  After about one month on Wellness, the bad breath is gone!  I guess the previous diet I had them on had a lot of non-digestible ingredients.  Whatever the reason, I'm happy :)
2509	4	I agree that this is agreat product.But I got it at King Arthur flour co.for $5.99 per pound.
2510	5	Wow, this is good!Great value for an aged Balsamic. Drizzled on beef after grilling brings out robust flavor, but not overpowering.  In comparison to the 30 year or 14 year, this is a good balanced value.
2511	5	I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )
2512	5	Just because I sent an order of these jelly beans<br />to my oldest son in Roswell, Georgia.  He travels<br />a lot and enjoys a snack while he is driving and<br />he loves licorice jelly beans.<br /><br />This would make a nice gift for any special person<br />in your life.
2513	1	The only good thing I can say about the Lemon Gluten Free cookies is that they really do have a good lemon flavor! The texture was like sand. In fact it was very much like a slab of wet sand with a good lemon flavor. Sorry to say, but I spent lots of money on this and am now stuck with what I consider inedible products.
2514	5	Koeze Colossal Cashews are most delicious  cashews I have ever tasted and they are HUGE.<br />They aren't kidding when they call them jumbo.  They  are so very flavorful.<br /> Order these and you won't be disappointed<br />(expect you'll wish you had ordered a larger size).
2515	5	I buy chicken livers for my cat. She has now learned to speak English persuasively in order to get these treats.(lol) They are economical and obviously well liked by my cat.
2516	1	These things are HORRIBLE!  They are very salty, have very little flavor and are just plain nasty.  Don't waste your money on these.... go buy some real cheese and have that instead!
2517	5	This is my favorite of all the Walden Farms salad dressings, and you really can't tell it's lo cal.  I buy it by the case!
2518	5	Nice taste. Very mild. Nice way to start the morning off! I love the large box that is very inexpensive. So much easier to buy a large box than getting small amount at the store.
2519	5	I love these pearls.  I can't find them in the local stores and they taste just like the pearls in the boba (bubble) drinks.  The instructions are a little off though -- probably a translation issue, since English is the second or third language on the package.  Simply boil these pearls for five minutes in water or whatever flavored water or juice you want and let them sit covered for 20 minutes.  I made pomegranate pearls last nite, that was really yummy!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lots of pearls for the money<br />Easy to cook<br />Great flavor<br /><br />Cons:<br />Instructions not entirely friendly for English speakers
2520	1	I'm absolutely in love with my Tanqueray & Tonics; I drink them at least once a week and was looking for a way to improve what seemed insurmountable with a better tonic water. Usually, I stick with Seagrams (and have even gone with Diet a few times). I purchased this case of Q Tonic thinking it would mix the low-calorie of diet tonic with the rich taste of non-diet tonic. I was wrong! After having numerous picky drinkers give Q tonic a taste, we've all come to the same conclusion: it tastes eerily similar to seltzer water. Have you ever been to a bar and ordered something with tonic only to find that they were out and substituted seltzer instead--it's no fun! Well, picture spending $45 dollars on a case of fancily bottled seltzer and mixing that with your favorite drink!<br /><br />So, in conclusion: if you like the fancy bottles and the lower calorie seltzer water tasting tonic, this is the tonic you want. If you enjoy the distinction of actual tonic versus seltzer, stay away from Q Tonic.
2521	5	I love this coconut water. It tastes great and is healthy. I mix 2 tablespoons of pure cherry concentrate in 6-8 ounces and get double benefits, and the more I drink it, the more I love it.
2522	5	My three dogs really love these treats.  They are made in the USA and reasonably priced.  One word of caution - I use these to stuff a  Waggle  bone and let my Dal go at it.  He loves it, but if he lays down with the Waggle on a light colored rug, the crumbs that fall out will discolor the rug if they get wet.  No big deal as the discoloration seems to wash out just fine.
2523	5	i love them and so does my aunt so i bought some and split them with her...i will be buying lots more
2524	5	I does take a little getting use to after years of eating processed garbage but it is well worth it. It's about time truly healthy real food snacks are available.
2525	5	This is a re-post of the review I left for the 5 oz bags ... Addictive and totally unexpected. I first tasted these at the Fancy Food Show in New York a couple of years ago. Was amazed to find them on Amazon - and bought immediately for our lunch clients. What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil, ending in a surprisingly smoky note.
2526	4	Our kittens will eat anything, even styrofoam & rubber bands if they can find it. but our older cats are very picky & spoiled. It used to be that we could only get them to eat Fancy Feast, then after they tried Fancy Feast Medlies, they wouldn't eat the regular Fancy Feast anymore. Now the only thing they'll eat is Natural Balance & Wellness, which are even more expencive, though they're not at all picky about cereal or treats. So we're spending about $80 a month on wet cat food, $100 if you include cereal & litter, & this is with a Petco discount.<br /><br />I'm not really pleased with the inclusion of vegetables though; our vet told us that cats cannot digest plant matter & that it only serves to make them poop more. Alos either Natural Balance or Wellness is giving our kittens random boughts of diarrhea.
2527	5	After having the conventional plastic packaged k cup brand coffees this was a very eco-friendly and satisfying alternative.  I have tried each of the Rogers family flavors and find them all aromatic and good tasting.  Only one downfall, as they cannot be stored in my countertop carousel.  This flavorful coffee is well worth the inconvenience of having to store the unused cups in an air tight container.  Who would think that such an economical coffee could taste so good.
2528	5	I have tried so many different coffees from Keurig.<br />This collection encompasses a full range of coffee selections.<br />From the milder Nantucket Blend to the strongest French Roast.<br />If you have a variety of coffee preferences in your home, as we do here, this collection has something for everyone.<br />If you want flavored coffee, this is not for you, but for a range of regular coffee, this is our household new favorite!
2529	4	Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.
2530	5	The cans arrived undamaged and the contents are delicious. This cream makes wonderful frozen pina colada's and I am glad I bought the case. It will just last the summer!
2531	5	My dogs just love them. They are very picky about their treats and they just love these.
2532	1	You are way better off ordering these directly from the website McCall Farms, much cheaper.  If you have already ordered these peanuts the website is actually on their label, very small below the nutrition facts.
2533	5	I love these fruit snacks and found it cheaper to buy them in bulk to pay a dollar for such a little one.
2534	5	After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.
2535	4	I won't comment on the price because that can change. We all do our best to find deals and bargains.<br /><br />This food is wonderful. I used to buy cheap, grocery store stuff and tried this on a whim. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />My dog is a little older and is missing some teeth. Since he is a shih tzu he also throws up from time to time after eating. (Do all shih tzus do this, mine has since birth) Anyway, this food seems to cut down on the incidents. The pieces are very small and easy for him to chew.<br /><br />It's good for him, a great size for my little dog, and I will continue to buy it.
2536	1	I've ordered white cheddar cheese powder (I understand, now even more than before, that this is seasoning, not just cheese powder) several times for use on popcorn, and it's even a bit salty for my taste, but I like it. I wish I'd looked at the ingredients on this seasoning, because had I known it had three times the sodium content of the powder powder I normally get, I never would have ordered it. But it was a bit less expensive, so I thought I'd try it. By the time I put enough of it on popcorn to really taste cheese, it's so salty I can't eat the popcorn. Amazon immediately refunded my money when I brought this to their attention.<br /><br />So I guess I'll stick with my usual favorite.
2537	4	I love these! They are so cheap, but so tasty! My husband thinks they are way too sweet, but I love them! They don't have a huge coffe flavor, so they are a bit sweeter than an actual cappuccino. Regardless, they are very tasty and at this price, who can complain? Their hot chocolate is pretty good too.
2538	2	I purchased this cat food after careful research on all the different wet cat food available.  I finally decided this was the best even though it was on the high side of expensive.  I never considered that ALL of my 4 adult cats and 3 kittens would refuse to touch it. Really???  I have never seen them do that before so I thought to try again on another day.  Nope not a fluke-- they steer clear of this food completely.  I will be donating the remaining 22 cans to the SPCA (where I adopted the three kittens from).  Wasted money?  Maybe, but hopefully the cats in the shelter will eat it.
2539	5	This is a great coffee for those that want a smooth, flavored k-cup. I add only a small amount of milk to my coffee because the flavoring is enough! :D
2540	5	showed up on time and at a price that was very competitive. I would buy from this vendor again without question.
2541	5	Deep Cleanse from Bija provides a strong cinnamon flavor while providing you with the most powerful detoxifying herbs such as burdock root, dandelion root, licorice root, fennel seed, nettle leaf, oatstraw herb and yellow dock root! Adding this tea to your diet will definitely help you to look and feel better!
2542	5	Whenever I use these instead of the regular garbanzo beans in salads and hummus, I get compliments.  They have a richer flavor than the others and they are great all by themselves - they make a very satisfying lunch or light dinner!
2543	5	I will definitely purchase these again!  If you like Cracker Jacks and you like Chocolate, you will love these.  They taste just like Cracker Jacks with a light chocolate drizzle.
2544	3	as far as gluten free products go - these aren't bad.  seems like nothing is really  good  so the best you can hope for is not terribly unpalatable.
2545	5	This item came very fast! And my French Bulldog ate this stuff even faster!Great product, great price, fast shipping. I recommend this to all dog lovers for a healthy dog treat!
2546	4	Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it.  I put a Kong liver snap treat (<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHNY6 >KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large</a>) in the Kong (<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8 >KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>) first, then  anchor  it with the liver paste.  I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog.  Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.<br /><br />She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted.  This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING.  Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz.........
2547	1	I enjoy the syrup - but hate the constant increases....just because they can?! Getting reeeally fed-up with the corporate greed in this country!
2548	5	I like Torani caramel syrup in combination with Coffee-mate vanilla chocolate creamer.  This pump lets me accurately and neatly measure the syrup into my coffee for consistent flavor, and prevents waste by spilling.
2549	5	I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.
2550	1	I was so immensly disappointed.  I was hoping to get the same tea that they serve in the chinese restaurants and kept being told that it was oolong tea.  I finally found it on Amazon and to my disappointment it did NOT taste the same!  Actually it was a bit bitter and now I have all of this tea I know it will take me forever to drink because of the flavor..  Was not happy..  :(
2551	3	I liked raviolis as a kid and thought I would enjoy the childhood flavors again. Chef Boyardee Raviolis taste pretty good just like I remember. Really filling too! Usually when a product is really filling I know it has lots of fat and these raviolis were no exception. 3.5 grams of saturate fat! I'm not accustom to eating that much fat and they made we feel a little nauseous shortly after eating them. Lighten it up Chef Boyardee!
2552	5	I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs. This food is a super high quality food for dogs as well as having some healing attributes that make it very healthy for seizures and liver issues. My Schipperke's are doing very well on this formula and no longer require Phenabarb or any seizure medication and the liver studies on their blood work are almost normal at 13 years of age after serious liver problems 8 years ago.<br /><br />Wellness tests All batches for problems prior to distribution. They did give a voluntary recall on the puppy formula even when it tested out with no contamination. I also feed the senior dog formula to my 100 pound German Shepherd dog as I believe it has given him wonderful joint health help as he ages.
2553	1	Southeast Asia coconuts<br />Where do their coconuts come from for this product?<br /> We work with small to medium sized cooperative farms in Southeast Asia. <br />Quote from FAQ's on  (...)  web site.
2554	5	This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!  Get some and you will see exactly what I mean.
2555	5	I enjoy ordering K cups from Amazon because I receive them quickly and get a good price.  I have had this type of coffee in the past and love it.  I would recommend this to everyone.
2556	5	I always use this stuff on my stir-fries ... and always do if given the choice!  It's sweet with a little bite to it and has a great consistency.  As I'm not a dieter, I don't have to use this product ... but I use it anyway!  Even my family can't tell the difference when I use it in recipes!
2557	3	I purchased this product online because I couldn't find it in the stores at that time (2 days later it was in the store also). It's good that comes quick, save a trip to the store, however, the price is so much higher than Walmart, Kroger, etc (50c per box more expensive, total 7$ more expensive than the stores)
2558	3	My dog loves it, she gets exited only from thinking she is going to get one. Her dentist is also happy with her teeth and it looks like this product delivers.<br />So why only 3 stars ? I'm not sure this product is good for the dog health. I heard some rummers abouth dogs who had problems with it and I always susspected the way it looks. Just doesnt look like something that can be good for the dog.<br />So what do I do ?<br />Eventhough my dog is medium size I give her the small ones and only few times a week. I hope it will not affect her health in the long run.<br /><br />BTW, if u ask my dog to rate, she will probably give it 6 stars (or bones), it is her favorite.
2559	4	I have a very, very, very, very, very hyper 4-yr old. He is particularly sensitive to artificial colors. Many of the  kid  drinks on the market are filled with hideously vibrant artificial colors. I needed an alternative for him.  The flavor isn't quite the same and the sweetness of this drink isn't the same type of sugary sweetness you find in the typical kid punch type drinks, but that's actually a good thing.  This tastes more like real cherry. My son loves this drink mix. I use it at less than half strength so the jar lasts even longer. The fact that it doesn't have sugar or artificial sweeteners is a plus. My son doesn't get that sugar high.  I also love to add this to water (although my favorite flavor is the strawberry while his is the cherry). This is definitely as good for adults as it is for the kids.
2560	5	I think this is probably as good as it gets for sugar free chocolate syrup.  It's still not as good as regular syrup, but I think I will buy this one from now on.<br /><br />When opening the bottle, it smells just like chocolate.. no funny odors.  The consistency is decent; could be a little thicker, but it's not watery like some sugar free syrup.<br /><br />And so.. the taste..  Well it is mildly sweet, and there isn't too much of an aftertaste.  The chocolate flavor is there, but not as strong as I'd like.  You can use more to make up for it.<br /><br />For me, the most important thing is there aren't any  funny  tastes, and the aftertaste is mild.
2561	4	This review is for the boneless ham. A little on the small size, but tasty. Be sure to thaw before baking or you will dry it out. Best eaten the day its made. I sliced some for the next morning and it definitely lost something. On the plus side if you've got a family, odds are there will be nothing left.
2562	4	I have ordered this assortment in the past and have always been pleased with the K Cups delivered.  I received my 24 count and not one duplicate flavor - each one an original.  I will order this assortment again.
2563	5	We purchased these vanilla beans to make vanilla extract for gifts.  The timing of shipping was very prompt.  They arrived only a few days after our order was placed, and we had enough to make two batches of extract, with a few left over.
2564	5	Green mountain Dark magic is bold and dark without being bitter. Thats why it is my morning wake up coffee.
2565	5	Probably the best tasting hot sauce I've tried.  Has a nice kick to it too, but not so hot it's unbearable.
2566	5	Great texture and balance of sweet to butter is just about right. Adults and kids both love them. Recommended
2567	5	Delicious loose earl grey tea.  I use it for making iced tea, my favorite.  Check out the Adagio IngenuiTEA brewer available here on Amazon for a great tea making setup.  My only wish is that Amazon stocked it in a bigger size.  I'm running out of ideas for things to do with all the dozens of little metal tea boxes i have around the house now.  Good for storing electronic cables, screws, poker chips, etc...<br /><br />Loose tea is much better than bagged tea... more room for the leaves to brew.
2568	5	I just received this wonderful Bonsai.  It looks great and was well wrapped to prevent breakage.  It looks as healthy as the picture displays.  I'm glad that this Bonsai was an  outdoor  plant and had great instructions (I am new to the Bonsai hobby).
2569	5	this is micheal keaton's funniest movie ever.he worked with tim burton in the 1st 2 batman movies.tim burton i'll admit is pretty freaky with his movies because they're all the same beetlejuice,batman returns,nightmare before christmas,and now willy wonka which i know will be wierd.but i give this movie 5 stars because its got some pretty good effects for the 80's.i just bought the second volume of the cartoon which is cool but i cant find the other ones
2570	5	I am not much of a baker but I made these to bring into the office. They were a great hit. For this mix, all you have to add is a little water and you end up with yummy, chewy, coconut macaroons. The flavor is good - not too sweet or fake coconut tasting. I followed the optional directions on the box to dip in melted chocolate and they turned out great. Highly recommend.
2571	5	Tthe best lime curd I have ever had. Tangy, flavorful, and creamy. I found it about a dollar cheaper in the grocery store. Still pretty expensive. 5 bucks for a small jar. A great little indulgence.
2572	5	This product when received became an instant household staple I share with many others.<br /><br />The unsalted  snack foods  offered through Amazon can be delivered in case-quantity then set out at social events to introduce others to healthier eating.<br /><br />And one can produce  dips  for selection at such social events by simply food-processing ordinary, or, ideally, organic, vegetables, also shipped through Amazon sellers or found locally.<br /><br />Experiment.  That's healthy to do.  Your own body is your own body.  Feed your own body carefully.<br /><br />Clint Williams<br />Oakland, Michigan USA
2573	4	I got these to eat healthier. They taste great with fat-free cheese or sugar-free jam.
2574	5	A lot of research was done before I found this site. Not only did they have the best price for saffron, but the quality of the saffron was excellent and was very fresh. If you enjoy cooking paella and spanish rice dishes, this is the only way to buy saffron...by the ounce (and fron this site)!
2575	4	My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.
2576	4	Stash probably has the best blend of affordable jasmine tea.  Mighty Leaf, Choice, and Numi are also good, but a bit higher price.
2577	1	...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging  peanuts . Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great  premium  brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!
2578	5	having always loved regular raisin brand, I had to try this new twist. The cinnamon make is taste so much better. The almonds, while I liked it, I would rather have just had it with the cinnamon.
2579	5	This is my favorite hot cereal. Cook as directed but let if sit for about 10 minutes before eating. They do not bill this as a 'diet' food but read the label, you will be surprised. This is wonderfully healthy! I just love, love, love this cereal!
2580	5	My hubby is the popcorn fanatic in this family. I found a bottle of this seasoning at a store 150 miles from here and brought it home.  He rolled his eyes at it, but about a month later tried it (tired of listening to my oooh's and aaaah's) and now it is his FAVORITE seasoning! You won't be disappointed!
2581	3	Honestly, I'm sure the tea works, don't really know. I have bronchiectasis and chronic asthma, yes... oh joy! So, I bought this, not really having much faith it'll work. But I guess it works, don't really know if it's this tea or my normal routine / slew of $550 a month of medications I take that's helping. But one thing I do know is that, I absolutely dislike the flavor, smell and aftertaste of this tea. It leaves a very odd aspertame (fake, cancerous sugar that used to be used as pesticide) on your tongue when you drink it. It's truly disgusting to me. Lots of good reviews on this tea and for the life of me, I can't figure out why as this tea tastes so nasty to me. To each his own! I guess if it works, it's all worth it.
2582	5	This is great oatmeal considering it is a package item. Tastes great and possibly even better, gluten free. That's very important as I have high sensitivities to gluten and wheat. We've tried all the flavors. They're all good but we do have a couple of favorites.
2583	5	I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times; it's a perfect refreshing cooler for summer.  With Amazon Subscribe and Save I never have to worry about running out.
2584	5	We cut back on our coffee consumption and only drink it in the AMs.  We wanted to have a flavorful pot for our daily cuppa so we asked our son (a quasi coffee expert).  He recommended 8 O'clock and specifically the French Roast.  We've found it to be superb.
2585	5	Yamamotoyama Green Tea was given to me by a friend when I was trying to ween myself off coffee and I've been drinking it ever since! It's got a slightly heavy, distinct flavor that's hard to describe, but as many other people say, it is extremely smooth. I generally have it with a little honey and it's great. I've also found that when I drink a cup after I eat it helps my (very fickle) stomach lol! Try it and you will most definitely be hooked.  ;)
2586	1	The package of sugar containers was wrapped in plastic, and most of the containers were broken, so sugar was spilled everywhere in the box because not only were the sugar containers broken, but the plastic wrap too! So I opened a box of sugar basically. Horrible packing job.
2587	4	This makes a nice cup of coffee that holds up well to cream.  It's dark but not bitter.  It tastes like good coffee.  I would buy this again.
2588	5	Whether for sore muscles or high blood pressure this stuff is easy to use and seems to be absorbed quickly by the body.  It really helps.
2589	5	I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels.
2590	4	This cream of mushroom soup has been a very good substiute for my boyfriend's favorite casserole dishes including green bean casserole.  It isn't as thick as the  normal  cream soups but it tastes very good.
2591	4	So far so good. My dog seems to love this things. They do stink when you open the box so beware. I don't know how well they preventing the plaque from building up on his teeth only time will tell. 4stars based on potential good it will do for my dog and the fact that he loves them. You do get alot to last you for 96 days b/c it only says to give one a day so I think that will be adequate time to fully evaluate. I'll update when that time comes but for now it's worth giving it a shot.
2592	3	There are only a few times that I drink Lapsang Souchong while I was in China, but that flavor never faded...I purchase this one based on others' review, but just find it's not the same flavor as in China. I can't say it's not good, it's just not what I used to have. For this one, you can smell that strong smoky flavor as soon as opening the package, however, from my previous experience, that smells remain very subtle until you drink the tea. Thus the smoky flavor here is too much that overwhelming the flavor of the black tea itself, which in my memory, should be mixed perfectly together. Or it can also be that what I had is loose leaf and this is tea bags.
2593	5	PURE, UNPASTEURIZED, UNFILTERED, ORGANIC, KOSHER, RAW HONEY<br />Love it, love it, love it.<br /><br />I rarely recommend buying something that's more expensive than any  regular  type, but organic is well worth it as far as I'm concerned. Any time you can afford organic I believe it's worth the extra money because it's all about your health, not just taste. Everything you eat affects your health. You either pay extra now for the good stuff, or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death.<br /><br />I get raw (unheated, never heat treated) honey from a friend now and then, she has her own hives, and Y.S. Organic honey is just as good if not better. Don't tell her, but I think this may be better than hers because her raw honey is not certified organic and kosher. Who knows where her bees have been. ;)<br /><br />I know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate, and I'm not sure what kind of honey this is (what kind of flowers) but the flavor is just right. Not too mild, not too strong, not too sweet. I know I sound like Goldie Locks, but it's just right.<br /><br />With honey bees rapidly disappearing from the world (scientists don't know why) I like the idea of organic hives - making sure chemicals are not spread around that may harm the bees as well as the people who eat their honey.<br /><br />One word of caution though, when you shop for this honey. If you don't read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic. Y.S. Bee Farms makes both organic and not organic, and they are both raw and unpasteurized. I uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles (see above). Organic is in glass jars, and more expensive. Non-organic is in plastic jars and a little less money. But if you don't look closely you may think the non-organic is organic because the name of the company is  Y.S. Organic Bee Farms , and that name is on all jars, organic or not. To make sure your honey, or any food item, is truly organic, make sure it has the certified organic seal, as this product does.<br /><br />~ ~ ~<br /><br />What you should know about raw honey vs. pasteurized honey:<br /><br />Raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees (naturally, that's what they do) that comes straight from the bee hive (through an extracting process in a controlled setting). Raw honey is unheated, pure, unpasteurized, and unprocessed. Raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase, an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads. Raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it, almost like yellow wax, when at cooler room temperatures. If the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup.<br /><br />Honey is an alkaline-forming food, which means raw honey contains ingredients similar to those found in fruits, which become alkaline in the digestive system. It doesn't ferment in the stomach and it can be used to counteract acid indigestion. When mixed with ginger and lemon juices, it also relieves nausea and supplies energy.<br /><br />Most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw. You can usually tell the difference by looking at it, when it's not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through, like a light colored thin syrup. This is because it has been processed and pasteurized (heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more, followed by rapid cooling) and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother, more appealing on the shelf, and easier to handle and package because it's not as thick as raw honey.<br /><br />Pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation. It also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that's why it looks  cleaner  and smoother. But, when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas, yeast and enzymes (that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system) are partially destroyed. For this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment.<br /><br />CAUTION:  Bee products may cause allergic reactions in some people. Honey is not recommended for children under two.
2594	5	If you like other flavored k-cup coffees, you will probably like this one.  This is one of my favorite k-cups.  I think it is a perfect balance of a lightly flavored coffee and superb aroma.  It has a very pleasant hazlenut aroma when it brews (stronger than some other flavors) and tastes like a great coffee with a light hazelnut taste.  This seems more like a medium roast than a light roast if you compare to other flavored coffees and I feel like it has a very nice coffee taste above all else.  I like medium coffees, so I think this one is great.  It isn't like drinking a shot of hazlenut flavoring or like drinking a strong starbucks coffee.  It is just a harmonious light flavor to a good medium coffee.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.
2595	2	I thought this was a good value.  Starbucks has a name, stores, and the price was good.  I should have saved my money and bought the equal amount of Dunkin Donuts brand whole beans cause it is so much better than this stuff.<br /><br />This coffee lacks even subtle character of Diner coffee.<br /><br />It is harsh on the pallet and coats your tongue.  French roast?  I never tasted anything this bad in France.  This is more akin to the coffee you may buy in India.
2596	5	great prices i order from here 2 times a month ..i trust amazon a lot and they have fast service and great service and these energy drinks are new..
2597	5	My wife and I have been a little frustrated with our Kuerig coffee maker because we want a big mug of bold taste and several coffees just come out weak!  Not this Double Black Diamond from Green Mountain! If you like bold flavor, you'll love this brew!
2598	5	I just tried the Spicy Amy's Chili. It was the best ever. I will try the other products as well. Keep up the good work. Your food is amazing.
2599	5	So much fiber!  Love it!  I had Kashi Go Lean for a while, plus a few other multi-grain cereal (even oatmeal at one point).. but none of them keep me full until lunch time.  This is about the only one that does it.  As a heads up, they sell normally at Target for $3.99.  That comes out to be cheaper than here I think.
2600	4	Always a favourite of mine in UK.  This drink mixes well with spiced rum.  It proved a hit with my US friends and is capable of crossing the pond in a single bound.....SUPER!  The Amazon product information would be improved with ingredients information as shown on the bottle.
2601	5	I am a huge fan of  foo foo  (flavored coffee) and this is by far by favorite.  Lots of flavor.  Not only does it taste wonderful...it makes your room smell really good!  I wish it was still offered as an  automatic send ...please bring it back!!
2602	5	Thank goodness they switched back to the old formula.  What were they thinking.  I stopped buying it a while back and my spouse bought some on accident.  I was about to throw it away, but I hate to waste food.  To my surprise it tasted good!  They call it  classic  now.  Some marketers ought to be fired over that one.
2603	5	I have been buying this food locally but began to have a hard time fInding it. I searched online and it was a little more cost effective. My pups seem to love this food.
2604	5	I'm Japanese and I think this is the best bagged green tea in the states. I'm VERY happy that I found this in Amazon because our Costco doesn't carry this anymore.
2605	3	I bought this product for chocolate milk.  I found it neither better, nor worse than any old store-brand chocolate syrup.  It's perfectly acceptable but not worth the huge online markup.  I think a lot of regional nostalgia is driving the raving 5 star reviews.
2606	5	I was impressed with the condition of these plants upon arrival. They were beautiful. No damage whatsoever. I will purchase this item, and other items from this seller again and again.
2607	5	I didn't think I would like any decaf other than Starbucks but I decided to give this a try since I liked their non-decaf. I was pleasantly surprised. Then Seattle's Best was no longer available in my area. Hooray for Amazon! They have it! Not only is this coffee very tasty but the price is right too. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a light breakfast coffee.
2608	5	I love these. I am very skeptical about healthy and tastes good in the same sentence but these chips fit the bill!
2609	5	Just what we were looking for. Makes for a quick and easy meal with noodles and fresh veggies. Great taste.
2610	5	I can't buy these too often - they are an addiction!  Absolutely wonderful with a companion scoop of ice cream, or just plain with glass of milk.  I love making them a part of gift baskets - for housewarming or hostess gifts.  Almost always get asked where I got them.
2611	1	So PG Tips Special Blend was an excellent bagged tea. So excellent that the think tank at PG Tips / Unilever decided to discontinue it. They claim this blend is the replacement. The Strong One is a worthless brew if you ask me. PG Tips Special Blend was an excellent tea this replacement is terrible (undrinkable). If anyone at PG Tips is listening please consider reintroducing Special Blend - remember what happened to the new Coke? If it isn't broke don't fix it.
2612	4	this big box of cookies, crackers was ok i was surprized to see only crackers in the box was cheeseits no other crackers andtheir was several diff.kinds of other cookies they were freash and just the right size for a snack.we liked the diff. kinds of cookies the kids liked them.
2613	5	Our dogs love very flavor of these treats. I like that they last so long! Our dogs all take turns throughout the week working on the treat bit by bit. Definitely a good value!
2614	5	With the Subscribe & Save discount, the price for this beats out all the supermarkets and discount supercenters I go to. As long as the price stays this low on Amazon, I'll continue to get it from here!
2615	4	The problem with most pretzels is that they are white-flour bombs.  Lots of carbohydrate and not much else (other than a ton of salt).  Consequently, I have been looking for a good whole-grain pretzel.  These are pretty good.  The multiple grains add a variety and depth of flavor not found in plain pretzels, and you sure don't miss the extra salt.  Although they have a crunch, they are not so hard that my wife won't eat them.  They have only three flaws.  First, they are slightly sweet.  Although it is a subtle sweetness (which I suppose some folks like), I could do without it.  Second, white flour remains the number one ingredient, notwithstanding the multiplicity of whole grains.  Third, although they are low fat, they are not fat-free.  I am not sure why the bakers find it necessary to add oil to a pretzel.  Despite these shortcomings, these are a good--and healthier--alternative to standard prtezels, and much, much healthier than most other salty snacks.
2616	1	I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received! AGREE. I ordered the Sea Salt&Vinger packs and am very disappointed. Ver weird Vinegary awful taste. The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross! I took one bite and had to throw the bag away. Agrre. Now I'm stuck with a bunch of 23 bags of chips that I'll never eat.
2617	5	These tasty treats are great alternatives to the gluten packed fruit snacks etc. They are all natural and organic. My daughter (2 1/2) loves them and I prefer she eats these over the sugar filled snacks
2618	4	We are vegan and so is our baby. When she turned about 14 months, I started giving her this vitamin, cutting it in half, since it's made for children 2 and up. She never had problems chewing it. I think she thinks it's candy...<br />I'm still nursing her and I give her the vitamin every other day or so, as a safety net, since she does eat a pretty good and complete diet.
2619	1	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164V0VW >Kraft Italian Salad Dressing, Fat Free, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 60)</a><br /><br />Big mistake, I am stuck with 59 packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings.  Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?  I will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them.
2620	1	Great coffee, BUT at 8.88 for 11 oz. this is almost twice as expensive as in any grocery store. I don't think we'll be ordering anytime soon.
2621	5	This is  hands down the best whole wheat pasta you can buy.  Costco no longer carries the whole wheat style and it is expensive here.  I now buy  bionature  here at Amazon and it is very good also.  Healthy and delicious.  Hope Amazon lists it in their subscribe and save program soon.
2622	5	My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.
2623	5	This is one of my favorite teas and I can drink it morning, noon or night-time -- with or without food.  It is caffeinated, so that may limit when others can drink it.  The taste is smooth and satisfying -- I drink it without sugar or milk.
2624	5	Product came very well packaged, small cooler pack to keep chocolates form melting, I live in miami and this was one of my concerns, the chocolates were delicious a real hit in the office, extra caffeine was needed, would recommend and buy again,
2625	5	I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.
2626	5	This tea is exactly what I was looking for in a morning tea.  Strong, well balanced flavor with no aftertaste.
2627	3	These bags of Canela are interesting.  Not reclosable so I put in a glass jar.  It is soft and fatter than the other cinnamon sticks I have used in the past.  It also has a very different smell than the Saigon Cinnamon.  It takes some getting used to but does grind and break easily and I like the flavor.  I am not sure about the value.  I have not compared it with the price of other like amounts.
2628	4	I've blended this with a darker full-caf Melitta coffee and LOVE the results.<br /><br />The fine grinding is a tad small for the french press I use, but the taste is wonderful.<br /><br />I was a little concerned at the darkness variation in the two when I decided to blend, but the outcome was fine.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have is the packaging. Cheap glue on the metal fold-down part causes it to fall off (true for both bags I received), so don't rely on that.<br /><br />Otherwise, a delicious coffee that is mellow in taste the way I choose to prepare it.
2629	5	The five stars are from Panda the Puppy.  This thing smells horrible, and looks disgusting, but the puppy loves it. He loves it so much that I can tolerate the horrible smell for him.  Panda loves treats, like most puppies, but this treat in particular gets his attention. It is working as a great training aid too.  He sits, he licks.  It is a treat that he is motivated to work for, and it makes training easier. We do have other treats that work, but this one has the benefit of a fast grab. I don't have to dig in a bag or really search for it.
2630	5	A nice flavored coffee in decaf.  Not many flavors in decaf.  A good bargin in k-cups.<br />It's a smooth cup of coffee.
2631	4	I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word  Bold  I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a  Bold  product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!
2632	3	I'm not sure what most of you pay for your sodas, but here they run around 85 cents a liter plus deposit of .05. When one adds the $25 for 60 liters of carbonation 25/60 (.42/L) and $6 for 12 L of flavor (.50/L) one is losing money with the home carbonation system. I do like the idea of making my own products though.
2633	5	I use to use the regular Lipton Onion soup mix for chip dip until I came across this a few years back.  This is far and away the best for dip.  The other was too salty and too strong.  However, the Golden Onion is far less salty and more subtle.  Lipton suggests using one packet for each pound of sour cream.  However, I buy a 3 lb of Daisy sour cream at Walmart and mix two packets (2.6 oz's) into the container and it makes the best dip.  I have literally caught guests dipping their fingers in it.  I hope they never quite offering it.  I like it best with big thick pretzels.  It's also delicous with vegies too.  My husband and I are active in the motorcycling community and and we like to entertain.  People literally look forward to our gatherings because they know we'll have the dip.  My husband tells our friends it's his  secret recipe .
2634	4	I got it because I was looking for a whole bean coffee that was a lighter roast. Some of the reviews mentioned that it wasn't a dark roast. Maybe its not but to my admittedly non expert tastes there was still too much of the dark roast bitterness.
2635	5	My family loves Caramel Crunch Chex Mix, so when I found it on Amazon at a great price, I bought it right away. This amount will last us a couple months.
2636	5	Be careful not to overcook this pasta; otherwise more carbohydrates will be released.<br /><br />Cook to the time recommended on the package and no more.  Check the Dreamfields website for more information under FAQs.<br /><br />As with all pasta one cooks the more it is cooked the faster the carbohydrates (and calories) are absorbed by the body.<br /><br />In other words, watch your pasta's cooking time, especially when it is time to stop cooking it.<br /><br />To reduce your carbohydrates and calories even more mix in some non-starchy vegtables with the pasta.  You can some up with some very great tasting combinations with a little  trial and error. 
2637	1	First of all, it's extremely obvious to me that the only person who gave this product  5 stars  is trying to sell this tea. Nothing about that review is accurate beyond what exactly you're getting in the box. The tea itself has virtually no flavor but it does have the aroma of flowers. (Think of that bar of decorative soap you saw sitting on the table at that garage sale)The  blossom  itself is rather kelp-like. It looks like a floating mass of sea weed with bits crumbling off. You'll find yourself pulling bits stiff colored leaves out of your mouth throughout the cup. I'm drinking a cup as I write this. I'll sum it up in a few words;<br /><br />Taste: Hot water (Added quarter table spoon of honey, I taste a lot of that now)<br />Aroma: Decorative Grandma soap no one would buy for a quarter<br />Visual: Amorphous green mass<br /><br />If you bought this as a gift, prepare to disappoint your loved one. Saaawweeee
2638	5	We want you to know that we are very pleased with the quality of service your company provides. We sincerely appreciate your responsiveness and the way you conduct business. We have recommended your company to others because of our satisfaction with your service & product. We look forward to doing business with you for years to come.
2639	3	Bought it for my husband and he really liked it. Not muck in the package for the price. Most likely won't buy it again.
2640	5	This whole grain rice mix is versatile and is an everyday staple at our house. Excellent quality and a good cooked result every time. We love it baked in the oven with chicken!
2641	5	This made the best kahlua pork for my son's luau party - tasted great. I will say, this is a lot of salt - be prepared to store it for a while. I have also used it in a salt grinder for smaller grain salt. Tastes different than Kosher or other salts. Nice product.
2642	5	Oh Glorious day when I found the best snack treat on Amazon.  Just like hot wings, except in pretzel form.  No longer have to wait for the store to get in stock, I can order online now.
2643	5	Bought this popcorn along with the Elite Popcorn maker.  Great taste, I like the fact that it has three separate pouches so you can vary the seasoning (I like mine salty so I use it all).  Can't be any easier to use, no measuring, popcorn & oil stay fresh because they are sealed.<br /><br />Came back to add my review and got some great tips.  Such as actually heating the oil first instead of dumping it all in at once.  Also liked the tips of adding the oil before turning on the popper (always worried about melting plastic or burning my hand) and pouring the popcorn/seasoning into a scoop to add to the popper.  Thanks to those who took the time to post the tips!
2644	2	I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated when it comes to tea, and I have never seen tea milled in this manner before.  There are large bits and chunks of leaves and stems.  The flavor of the tea is very grassy, and the tea looks like it is relatively raw.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I'd avoid this tea and get the organic pinhead green.  Better yet, visit Stash's website for teas that come from established tea estates.  I recommend the Ambootia tea estate's Darjeeling Green.
2645	5	I first purchased these crackers from Sam's. When I started looking for them locally I could not find them. So, of course I went to Amazon and found them. The brand is Austin and the taste and flavor is really good. Better than any others I have tried. So they are really worth the extra effort.
2646	1	These multigrain crackers are absolutely wonderful. I gave only one star, because of your (Amazons) price....it is twice more expensive than at Sam's Club ($7). So why are we going to buy these from this source. Amazon, I am a huge fan, and regular shopper, but this really disappoints me. I will be checking your prices more closely.
2647	3	This shampoo really cleans your hair- perhaps overly.  In the shower, after using this product, my hair feels stripped and straw-like.  I definitely put conditioner on every time I use this shampoo.  That said, afterwards (with the conditioner), my hair feels very light and clean.  I do not feel like there is any build-up in my hair.<br /><br />For me, I believe this shampoo is a bit strong.  However, I do not use any styling products such as mousse, or hairspray.  I think if I did, this would be a nice shampoo, as I am fairly confident it would strip all of that gunk from your hair.  Or if you have really oily hair, this might be a good shampoo to try.
2648	5	This is a very tasty soup!  Like their lobster bisque, it's flavor is somewhat muted but still has a unique deliciousness all it's own.  I love clams and lobsters so I may be prejudiced in favor of this soup!  I highly recommend it to everyone but beware that it's high in fat (18 gms/can).  The salt level is par for the course for canned soups.... 1280mg/can.  It doesn't say if it's Sea Salt or regular, bad salt.  And the cans are small so the price is actually quite high.  The ingredients list: premium clam juice, finely ground premium clams, cream, wheat flour, butter , tapioca starch, onion powder, salt and proprietary spice blend.....no artificial preservaties, MSG, or trans fats.  This is a truly nutritious, healthful meal.  Good saturated fats are required by the brain and nerves in order to function and repair properly so I accept the % of fat as good in this case.  I will be buying this soup again!
2649	5	I love the flavor of Maranatha.  It has a distinct almond flavor.  If you are looking for a peanut butter like flavor, go with Barney Butter.  However I like the almond taste of Maranatha almond butter.  If you aren't sure, try it a small jar at your supermarket first.  I read reviews that it tasted rancid, which is not the case.  Although if you expect this one taste just like plain peanut butter, you will be disappointed.
2650	1	We have ordered this coffee for years on Subscribe and Save.  There was a time when it was a good deal but those days are over.  The price has now climbed out of the  reasonable  range and I will be canceling my subscribe and save on this item.  It was under $20 for years now its climbed to over $26.
2651	5	This is one addictive snack ... and healthy to boot.  My kids love them as well.  I recommend both the original and the Caesar flavors.
2652	1	This tastes like mint-flavored frozen water, and I mean that in the worst way possible. How is this company in business? Stupidest impulse buy I've made in months.
2653	5	This is a perfect balance for those who do not like, or would prefer a change of pace from actual barbeque sauce. While I love it all, this hoisin sauce will get people that don't like tomato based barbeque to eat without arguing. It's all about the piquant flavor.
2654	5	I'm not usually a graham cracker/sweet snack kind of person, but these are absolutely delicious!  Why anyone would continue to buy food made with hydrogenated fats when snacks like these are available is beyond me.
2655	5	Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!
2656	5	I loved this green tea! I say where did it go, because it didn't take me long to drink all the cups! I guess I will have to order more, so good!
2657	5	Have been using these now for over three years.  The flavor quality is outstanding and the simplicity of use is great!  I have been on subscribe and save on this now for two years!  Never without a good cup of brew.
2658	4	This stuff is wonderful on days when you just don't feel like going all out on making dinner. Just trim the fat off your pork chops, and shake and bake! Shake and Bake seasonings supplies one plastic bag inside the spice bag for you to use. Just pour spices into the plastic bag, add chops, shake, and bake. Easy as one, two, three. Tastes great, and easy. Kids love it too!
2659	5	I purchased this product and used it for one month. I had lab work taken in February prior to starting the use of the coconut oil. Then I started using the coconut oil, in my food and on my skin. I used the whole 16 oz container in March. Then I had my labs redone in April 1st. My A1C in February was 9.7 the most recent A1C is now 7 which is almost normal. So even though I was also taking my medication, the addition of the coconut oil was the miracle in my book. I have signed up for subscribe and save and will be using the coconut oil with a shipment monthly. I was hesitant at what the results would be as I have tried other things, but it works. Used it on a skin rash as soon as it started and within two days it was gone. Try it for yourself.
2660	4	We just purchased a 4 month old Siberian kitten. She loves interactive toys, but we also wanted a break from having to hold everything. We purchased this and she loves it. It's too tall for her attached to the door, so we added some large rubber bands to the string and it reaches perfectly from the door now. She plays with it incessantly, and loves the sound it makes. This is a great addition to your cat toys, especially if you want them to have fun without you having to participate.
2661	5	At nearly a buck-fifty per, this choice is not cheap compared to the 1 liter store bought lesser quality alternatives (Schweppes, Hansen and Shasta). On the upside, at least I don't end up tossing out half a liter that ends up going flat since I can't realistically consume that much tonic. In the end, I really enjoy the taste and know that I am getting a much better/high quality mix for my Blue Safire. YUM...
2662	5	I only drink unsweetened decaf tea and this is a GREAT TEA! Not bitter, very smooth. When I got remarried the kids were not able to tell that they were drinking decaf...in fact they commented that I made they best tea they ever had!!  Have tried several teas before I found one I likes. This one is a keeper.  Will never drink another brand of decaf tea.
2663	5	NuNaturals Stevia is the only sweetener that I use in my beverages and cooking. I have tried other brands and this one is the best! It hasn't any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market.
2664	5	It is perfect for a healthy chocolate fix.<br />I'd love to find a variety pack.<br />Wonderful to find it in Amazon's subscription program.
2665	5	These cookies are really gooey and chocolaty, more scrumptious than any human being can withstand! They taste like super rich brownies with the extra quality of being gooey. At 150 calories per cookie, this bag contains enough food energy to blow most bank vault doors off their hinges, so be forewarned! Nabisco has gotten the ingredients right with this one also. As you may know from my other reviews, I am very hard on manufacturers who do not use acceptable ingredients. This has my seal of approval. So, if you are not concerned about counting calories, or if you are one of those rare individuals who actually CAN eat just one, then see if you can withstand the rapture of eating these.
2666	5	My dog can't get enough of these! they are the perfect treat for her as we just put her on a no-grain diet for health reasons. plus they have no other ingredients in them so you know exactly what you're getting.
2667	3	I would not give this a 1 star but I would not give it a 5 star either. I am thinking 2 1/2 is fair. The thing that bothered me the most was the color. I bought a 70 calorie K cup apple cider and the smell and color were both wonderful. This is more of a watered down coffee color and the taste is just ok..I am not sure if I will buy it again or not..for a 10 calorie hot drink I guess I really should not complain..
2668	4	I use this to keep my dog from running through my garden. I works very well for that, however,you must remember to cover it up when it is raining (or leave it in some sort of a shelter), or it will quit working. I actually think the manufacturer should do a better job of weatherproofing it, as the item is intended for outdoor use, isn't it? Still, I am purchasing another one.
2669	5	These are awesomely-delicious cookies.  Crispy and flavorful; it's hard to tell that they are gluten-free.  I highly recommend trying these if you are looking for a good gluten-free cookie.  Thanks, Pamela's!!
2670	5	I like this blend and the fact that it is organic and fair trade, but I want to make mention that this is not decaf coffee.  My husband drinks decaf and it is getting harder to find good decaf at the big box stores so I hopped on Amazon and searched on 'decaf kcup organic' and this item comes up.  As I was loading up our carousel I noticed how the label looks exactly like the ones on  my  level of the carousel (caffeinated)...yep, it is indeed NOT decaf.  And I certainly get it a lot cheaper at my local warehouse place. Lesson learned to read the description forward and back several times before adding to my cart.  Hopefully this review will save someone else from this mistake. I'm also going to try to report the discrepancy to Amazon if I can figure out the proper channel for doing so.
2671	5	These are our favorite bars - not too sweet and all natural. We order them by the bulk every time. The cranberries give them a bit of a tangy flavor which makes them just right. The almonds taste fresh and crunchy. Highly recommend them.
2672	5	During training of Kaylee, our 75 lb. German Shepherd, we found that she does not like anything (treats or food) in large chunks. She is just a  dainty  eater and even the smallest Milk Bones dog biscuits were too big for her liking. When my neice gave her a bag of Zukes Mini Naturals for her 1st birthday she went crazy for them! They are PERFECT for training and she responds wonderfully. I highly recommend these if your dog is a  dainty  eater (I've never had one before) and even if they will swallow a hot dog whole (like my last dog, a Lab) these Mini naturals will be loved.<br />Bob
2673	4	They were pretty good but I can't rave about them. I have had better, but they were good. Nothing else really to say, I bought them because they got so many great reviews, but they were just okay (average).
2674	4	I use the coconut oil not for cooking, but instead as a skin barrier with my infant. It's natural healing properties help her skin as well as heal my dry hands from washing them so often after diaper changes. I also use it in her diaper wipe solution! Smells great too!
2675	5	When I tried this cereal I was not anticipating how great the strawberries would taste!  They are REAL berries and taste so good I could eat them alone for a snack.  Freeze dried fruit makes a difference and they complement the cereal which is lightly sweetened and stays crunchy in milk.<br />When I am trying to maintain my weight or lose a few pounds this is a pleasurable healthy cereal that I prefer for calorie control and taste.
2676	5	This was my first order from Hirt's Gardens...I'm a believer!!<br />I'll be back.<br />You see folks,  what you see IS what you get  in the case of this beautiful bonsai. It is exactly as pictured; arrived safely packaged, no damage, and also a very healthy, robust bonsai. I'm having fun w/this.<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EBJSKC >Japanese Juniper Bonsai Starter Tree - 4  pot</a><br /><br />Thanks Hirts!!
2677	1	The food deserves 5 stars, but the seller (1800PetMeds) deserves zero stars, if that could be assigned. My dog has allergies, but does well on this brand of non-grain dog food. I thought it would be smart to order through Amazon, since it is difficult to find in stores, but that was a mistake. It has been 14 days since I ordered, and the product has not yet arrive. Nine days after the order, it had not even shipped. And while it was shipped via Fedex, the Fedex tracking says the order will take about 6 to 7 days to deliver. The seller must have asked for special slow delivery... Never again will I buy from this seller.
2678	5	I have thus far sampled three of Izze's All Natural Sparkling Juices : Apple, Clementine, and Grapefruit.  All of them feature their natural fruit flavor and lack of added sugar.  In each case, the result was much like having real fruit in liquid form and the natural juices had more than enough sweetness on their own to offset any desire for a  sweet fix .<br /><br />Oddly enough, the sparkling water altered the drink differently in each of the three cases.  I'm not sure if this indicates a difference in the water or the interaction with the different juices.  In the case of the clementine, it was very noticable - almost reaching orange soft drink status.  For the apple, it was more like sparkling cider.  It was barely noticable in the case of the grapefruit juiice.<br /><br />This might make the clementine more ideal for youngsters because of its affinity to Sunkist (although, in my opinion, far tastier and, one assumes, healthier) and the others more suitable for adult palates.  In any case, this mix of fruit juice flavor and  fizz  make it a good choice for hot summer days.
2679	3	As a former St*rbucks drinker, I find I'm always looking for coffee that's  just a little stronger . Jet Fuel fills that need nicely. I can finally drink a good strong cup of coffee without going broke.<br />EDIT 5/6/10<br />I have returned to edit this review after trying Green Mountain's REVV. I am dropping this review to 3 stars because REVV is just so much better.<br />I found jet fuel to be a little bitter. The first time I drank it I went a little heavy on the half & half and didn't notice it. Over time the bitterness becomes quite distinct.<br />I have found that I much prefer REVV for the caffeine kick it provides while still being incredibly smooth.
2680	5	This rice is good and very nutritious. It doesn't swell or fluff like white rice or parboiled rice. A cup of this is a lot for one person and could last 5-7 days. That is good if you have plans to eat rice for a whole week. Don't be fooled by it's size. This rice has a lot of fiber and other nutrition so it fills you quickly. Only about four scoops of a regular size spoon (a size up from soup size) is enough. I added a little bit of concentrated coconut cream to it and ate it with baked chicken; vegetable aren't needed. I went to the toilet often after eating this for three days. If you eat too much of it it may cause you to have pasty, constipated-like stool. This rice goes perfect with poultry (chicken, turkey, duck, goose, quail, etc...)Coconut cream was optional for me and I'm glad I tried it; however, a little sprinkle of salt will go a long way.
2681	5	All three of my cats are wild about the Chicken Pot Pie variety of Petite Cuisine.  It's real chicken in a clear broth, and it actually looks like something you'd serve yourself.  All the ingredients are  real  -- no meat by-products, wheat gluten, preservatives, dyes.  There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this.
2682	5	Bought to use for marathon training and the race, this is a good flavor that does the trick re energizing
2683	4	I always keep a few of these on hand. On days when I am traveling and my husband is in charge of getting the kids off to school or when we are just running late, we can grab these out of the cupboard and lunch is ready to go. My kids love them and I know that they are still getting a healthy lunch.
2684	5	I am addicted to this drink. However, I now add about a tablespoon of vanilla milk (or milkshake) to it and it is then just what it used to be! I agree, this is much easier to find now. Walmart carries it, but I haven't seen it in the regular supermarkets yet. Still, it's much cheaper there!
2685	5	I tried the unsweetened soybutter about 3 years ago.  I gagged!  Then a year after that, my young son was diagnosed with peanut allergy.  So, we have lots of this in our house.  I just bought the unsweetened version for myself, everyone else in the family likes the sweet ones.  I put about a tablespoon with jam on bread and you have the perfect peanut butter replacement.  I do not notice the lack of sugar.  I also have the Clown Gysin soy butter too.  It has a good flavor as well.  I think they put more oil in theirs since that version has more fat in it than the IM Healthy.  That is what makes the Clown Gysin version more peanut buttery sweetened than the IM Healthy.  Right now this is my favorite.
2686	5	I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).<br /><br />Now, I am going to say that I am 100% Carnivore!! And I am a absoulte jerky fanatic as I've had it made out of Beef, Deer, Rabbit, Fish, Bison, Buffalo, and even Turkey Jerky!<br /><br />But I can honestly say, this was fantastic! It had a nice stringy texture, like actual meat. Was flavored nicely, a little mosit, and it left me wanting more!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought only one as I think I could have eaten several :)<br /><br />Also, love the fact its only 81 Calories, with 1g of Fat but still has 10g's of Protein!!
2687	5	These chew sticks are just the right size for small to medium size dogs.  Ours went to the baby pomeranians and they were an instant hit.  It helps to know that you are providing them with a low calorie snack (especially for those who have more sedentary pets, not a problem here).  These are substantial for their size measuring in at approximately 5 inches by 1/2 inch.  They are also gluten free and full of soluble fiber.  Now, I haven't heard any of our pups complaining about needing to be on a gluten free diet or needing more fiber, but certainly it can't hurt.  All in all, a healthier alternative to some of the other brands out there.
2688	4	The KIND Plus cranberry almond bars are healthy for you and absolutely delicious.  I think they are better if you refrigerate them prior to consuming.  Great product.
2689	5	My dogs LOVE bully sticks and somehow think bully springs are even better! These arrived quickly and the dogs seem to think each and every one is great. (Sometimes dogs will have a favorite out of identical toys or chews, as dog owners know. In the case of these springs, there's never one that's left out or chosen last.)
2690	5	my family loves this pasta and we can only get it at one store not super convenient, plus it's way more expensive there than buying in bulk from amazon!
2691	4	No bitterness.  A strong, full-bodied, cup but does not taste like ashes.  Smooth, very drinkable.  If you like bold, dark coffee, this will please.
2692	5	My dog has been loving these chews for years! I give him one everyday and it has done a great job at keeping plaque and tartar build up at bay.
2693	5	This came quickly, and the product is very good, you have to use canning salt in making pickles, and it is hard to find this in Miami.
2694	5	Consider a purchase.  I love to cook with this.  Adds a special flavor to any recipe.  We use it when we make a Rue for our Gumbo and is especially good when frying up onions.
2695	5	Not as good as fresh ground, but this is the best K-Cup I've had.  Kona is definitely a treat, though I may grind my own and make my own K-Cup in future.<br /><br />If you don't like Kona, I wouldn't spend the money.  There are lots of blends out there that work.<br /><br />Service and shipping were very acceptable.
2696	1	This is one of the most disgusting Hamburger Helper Meals. The glaze was so sweet, it reminded me of lemon cookies. The pasta wasn't good either. NO flavor what so ever of lemon and herb chicken. Overly sweet and lemony grossness is more like it. What a waste of $2.50 and not to mention my expensive chicken breasts.
2697	4	These are super cute! I have no problem with these though I warn you that there's only Red and Pink hearts that were included in this jar. I didn't mind much cause I actually didn't want white. But if you were expecting or needing white, you might want to purchase from another seller instead of Amazon as the one I received was only in Red and Pink.
2698	2	I'm not sure why it took about two hours in the oven to get these brownies to finally finish cooking.  I used a pyrex baking bowl, at the correct temperature about 8x8 and they just seemed to stay drippy in the center.  I did used a greek style yogurt, not sure if that matters. Does anyone have any tips or know what I did wrong?<br /><br />The aroma and flavor is fantastic. You'll never miss the fat, but watch the calorie count - it's still pretty high. Don't fool yourself into eating the whole pan.<br /><br />I later tried much cheaper Duncan Hines and substituted pineapple (puree'd) for oil.  While not at tasty as 'No pudge' brand, it baked on schedule and tasted nice. Substituting pineapple seemed to give it a slightly more cake-like texture.
2699	5	I have been searching for a stevia based soft drink for several years now, as I have been a diet cola addict my whole life and knew I needed to get off of the artificial sweetners. I was SO happy to find Zevia at a local market- tried the cola & lemon/lime and had to have more! My local store only sold individual cans( not even 6 packs....go figure) and I let them know straight away that they were the only store in town selling Zevia and they were making a BIG mistake! So I bought TWO cases here(the 1st case arrived damaged, cans busted and a few empties)but since then they have arrived in perfect condition with much better packing. Very happy and a lifer, for sure!
2700	5	For me, the most important thing is that I know what my dog is eating. I will not buy any dog food/treat not made in the USA or Canada. This severely limits my options.  Thank goodness for smaller labels like Cloud Star.  I only wish that other pet food companies would take a hint and stop using Chinese ingredients and start making a better quality product (on a side note, Newman's own is a good organic brand that makes good treats).<br /><br />Anyway, my little buddy has pancreatitis, so he cant have high fat/low quality food.  I used to feed him those chicken jerky strips, but after the pet food recall I check all the labels and have not been able to find anything that isn't made in China or  irradiated for safety. <br /><br />These treats are %5 (min), which is pretty low.  Aside from knowing that these treats are made in the USA, as are all of the ingredients too, the best part about these treats is that they really are soft and chewy.  I can break one up into about 10 pieces super quickly and my dog thinks that he is now getting 10 treats instead of one.  Either way he adores these treats.  I'm glad I've found something that is well priced, quality, good for training, and made in the USA!<br /><br />Here are the ingredients (not bad considering this is a treat!)<br />Chicken, unbleached wheat flour, tapioca starch, maple syrup, glycerin, rice flour, wheat gluten, gelatin, natural flavor, sea salt, garlic powder, natural smoke flavor, phosphoric acid, sorbic acid, mixed tocopherols (natural preservative).
2701	4	Ordered two of these to rid clutter off my counter.  Fairly easy installation; just remember to check direction of the pulldown and closeness to any contact walls, husband forgot to do this twice and had to change afterwards.  Not easy to do but he managed.  Received lots of compliments from visiting family and friends plus wanting to know where to purchase one too. Enjoy not having clutter on counter and this does the job. Only gave 4 stars as the directions were a little too simplistic.
2702	5	Great product, great taste, can't be beat EXCEPT THE PRICE: it was $10.00 cheaper today at Sam's Club, including tax. Enough said.
2703	5	I'm quite happy with this  generic  gelatin.  I don't see much difference in this and the  name-brand .  When it comes to the price difference, you just can't beat it.
2704	2	Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy.
2705	5	This has become my favorite coffeee.  It is strong and bold without being bitter. I even make a second cup with the same puck and it is still good.
2706	5	These are the best! Nice crunch and nice flavors a little sweet, salty and crunchy. One bag equals one serving of vegies, not a bad way to get your vegies. I will continue to order these for sure. Price is good here on Amazon.
2707	5	I purchased a bag of this mix from a local store, but don't remember which store - so was very pleased that I could order from Amazon.  I used the recipe the first time I made pancakes and thought the mixture too thick.  Thereafter, I thinned it with a little water and it was just right.  Delicious with a little butter and maple syrup!!!!!
2708	3	This cracker was good but not exactly what I was hoping it would be. I was looking for something more healthy than the typical cracker which was why I bought it. The cracker by itself would be a good snack on its own, but I think the flax seed may make it a bit oily so when I paired it with cheese it didn't really work.
2709	5	It's hard to believe that something this good, is so unbelievably good for you as well! Love Crunch has created a perfect union of taste with health. They combined rolled oats, flax seeds, coconut, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, dried strawberries, dried raspberries and chunks of dark chocolate into an organic snack that will keep you and your heart healthy and happy.  All berries keep your artery and vein walls strong and flexible. Dark chocolate does the same. Oats keep your body really strong. My father's ancestors lived on a flax farm and lived to 107, so I know for a fact that flax keeps your cholesterol super low and your heart super healthy. The benefits you will get from this super snack are unbelievable- and the taste is beyond delicious! You will love this cholesterol free, low sodium, low calorie snack, but the benefits from eating this treat will love you even more!
2710	4	I love this with my tea. I use a lot of sugar 4 tea (no matter the flavor) and this is one of the perfect fixes to regular granulated sugar.
2711	5	Like many of the other reviewers I tried many premium KIBBLE for my two mini dachshunds, and this has been by far the best.  The kibble is tiny and perfect for the small breed.  The ingredients are Deboned Turkey, Chicken Meal, Salmon Meal, Oatmeal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground Barley, Rye Flour, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a natural source of Vitamin E), Menhaden Fish Meal, Tomato Pomace, Natural Chicken Flavor, Pea Fiber, Tomatoes, Salmon Oil, Ground Flaxseed, Carrots, Spinach, Sweet Potatoes, Apples, Blueberries, Potassium Chloride, Minerals [Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Proteinate, Ferrous Sulfate, Copper Proteinate, Copper Sulfate, Manganese Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Sodium Selenite], Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin E Supplement, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Vitamin A Supplement, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B-12 Supplement], Choline Chloride, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative), Chicory Root Extract, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Chondroitin Sulfate, Dried Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation products.
2712	3	World Kitchens Brown Sugar Jerky met all expectations.  I believe I have purchased this brand from a Wal-Mart, so I was not expecting the best.  I believe it is one of the cheapest beef jerky options and brown sugar flavoring appears to make it even cheaper.  BUT I still enjoyed the beef jerky!
2713	5	If you are looking for a chocolate that is as mysterious as it is delicious, I can highly recommend the Dagoba Chai chocolate bars. The delicate snap, warm melting milk chai-flavored chocolate and crunchy crystallized ginger makes this a highly memorable experience. The spicy chai flavor is completely unique and makes this chocolate a little more exotic.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
2714	5	At first I had a hard time removing these lids from small cans such as Fancy Feast.  The solution is to just add hot water to a bowl and set the can in the bowl.  This takes the chill off the cat food and also makes the lid easier to remove.  (The cats don't like cold food and they don't like the microwave method!!)
2715	5	I am a big fitness guru and my diet never allows for sugar. With that said, I never miss it because of Truvia! I used splenda for years, but after a while didn't feel it was safe to use of such extended periods of time. Therefore, I turned to Truvia as it is supposed to be the safest non-caloric sweetener the market has to offer :) Great taste unlike other Stevia products like PurVia(gross!).
2716	5	That is my new favourite k-cup. I've tried about 20 flavours of k-cups thus far and this one is TOPS for me.  It's what I'm looking for in a coffee:  complete and full body, ABSOLUTE flavour (your taste buds don't have to dig in to find it, it's there). I think it's perfect for any time of the day - morning, after lunch, after dinner. This is the one.<br /><br /> My financial advisor came over recently and I asked him if he'd like a cup of the Van Houtte Honduras. He liked it a lot. Next time he came over, I asked him if he'd like something to drink and he asked for  that coffee you gave me last time . Yeah, it's that good.
2717	5	This graviola tea was phenomenal. The taste was delicious and fresh, unlike the stale pre-bagged graviola tea I've tried before.<br /><br />Bag seems to seal well, and has kept tea fresh since I've bought it.
2718	2	Perhaps it's the additional ingredients (organic maltodextrin, organic corn starch, organic sunflower lecithin), but this stuff tastes really awful.  I have an 8 month old, and added less water to make it thicker.  All that really accomplished was to make the powder less dilute & the pungent flavor even stronger.  My child wouldn't eat this until I mixed it in with some other food.  I'll use what I have left to add to other food for the nutritional value that the powders offer, but I was really surprised & disappointed in this product.  How do you mess up something so simple as sweet potatoes?  Great idea, poor execution & way too expensive for this product.
2719	5	My husband was introduced to Ginger Snappish Tea in the grocery store.<br />He has cancer and is not suppose to have caffine. He loves his coffee.<br />He thought the tea tasted so good, he can do without the caffine.<br />Better for him and his cancer is stable at this time.
2720	5	We got these cookies at a local health food store and our little girl LOVES them.  We have other gluten, wheat, dairy, casein, egg free cookies but if she has her choice she asks for  the ones with creme in 'em.   They are very good!
2721	5	I brought this pack of bottles after trying out the Torani vanilla flavor from my local grocer. They carried only 3 flavors and I just knew I'd get a caramel one off amazon.<br />Buying the bottles off of here is a massive savings. I brought a tiny bottle for the same price as one of these 25oz guys!<br /><br />Please don't think that this syrup tastes like caramel topping. It's CLEAR!! And it's meant to flavor drinks. That being said, I love this stuff! I make a large latte for myself a few times a week and put a shot of this stuff in there and it tastes better than local franchises!<br /><br />I love that it's all natural and it doesn't have too much sugar. I'm using this stuff instead of sugar to sweeten and flavor my lattes from now on.
2722	4	unit is very good and does it job but i should have gotten the 36 count one.<br />in all it is very good.
2723	4	I purchased these coffee bags for use at work since we no longer receive free coffee from our compmany, and I don't want to deal with a coffee maker.  I don't drink coffee very often but when I want to, these coffee bags come in handy.
2724	1	Plant was received in poor condition.  Lost many leaves and am still working on keeping it alive and restoring to look as photo.  In future I will not purchase live plants from outside of area.  Recommend buying at local stores instead of shipping!
2725	1	Kikkoman mirin is probably what's called mirin-fu chomiryo (literally mirin-like seasoning). It's certainly not hon mirin (true mirin). If you look at the ingredients list, you'll see a big give away: Rice, Water, **Corn Syrup**, Alcohol, Salt. I'm not even sure this is made with rice wine. It's got rice and (a very little) alcohol in it, but it's sweetened with corn syrup. That's not mirin.<br /><br />Real mirin is sweetened by rice that has been subjected to the Aspergillus oryzae fungus, which breaks down the rice starches into sugar. It's what's used in the production of sake. Mirin uses the same fungus to produce the unfermented sugars that sweeten this essential Japanese cooking wine.<br /><br />If you're looking for the real thing, go to an Asian market and check the labels. Anything with sugar or corn syrup in it isn't authentic. Eden Foods also makes a widely available and very good mirin made from organic brown rice, rice koji (Aspergillus oryzae), pure water and sea salt.<br /><br />(The salt in mirin sold in the US is not authentic either, it's added to calssify the wine as cooking wine, thereby avoiding alcohol taxes).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, read the labels and opt for authenticity. You won't regret it.
2726	5	O.M.G. I am OBSESSED with Pomegranate Bai! It is so refreshing and a great low-cal product to refuel the antioxidants! It is a great drink to get me through my 3-hour classes each night! It is locally-based so I get really excited to see it in other places! I can't get enough of Bai!
2727	5	If you don't want all of the  extras  this is the better choice. You can add whatever you like, such as, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, sugar, etc.
2728	5	This was delicious. I was so pleasantly surprised by the texture...just like regular pita. It does not have complex flavor so it goes well with many other things like hummus and falafel. I highly recommend this and their other bread products which are also very good.
2729	5	The ingredients in this seems to be better then  Fancy Feast  which is mostly fat. I have one finicky cat and one who will eat anything. Both love it. It is a good every other day [half way healthy] treat for them.
2730	5	My dogs love these!  They get extremely excited when they know they're about to get one.  Two of the three dogs we have are four years old and their teeth are really clean.  My older six year old still has some buildup but these do help her go a little longer between cleanings.
2731	5	Simply THE BEST.  NOT hard - GREAT FLAVOR ( the ORIGINAL ) - like eating POPCORN - ya can't STOP !!!!  HELP  !!!
2732	5	This stuff is great.  The quality of the chocolate is excellent.  I have purchased this same chocolate from others on the net, but when you get the ones with German labels (e.g. not intended to be marketed in the US), there is no expiration date on the bars.  As a result I have received very old chocolate (with white haze) from others.  Not here!  These ones are in English and labeled with an expiry date.  When purchased directly from Amazon, I have always received chocolates in excellent condition and several months away from their expiry.
2733	5	I love this salad dressing. I can usually find it at my local Albertson's.  I usually have heartburn after using most salad dressings but not with this Seven Seas! I always keep an exta bottle in my pantry so I don't ever run out.<br /><br />I plan on ordering this multi pack.
2734	1	A short background on the eating habits of my two cats, one is super finicky and the other cat will eat just about anything. When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food. They refused to eat any of it. I like the premise behind the food, all natural and grain-free, but I am going to have to go back to the prior food my cats like. Hopefully my local animal shelter can make use of the food for their cats, if they even eat it.
2735	5	I'm sorry to say I passed up this New York-style ground coffee in the grocery aisle time and again, mistaking it for all those other cans that wreak havoc on your stomach. But when the price of Folger's started skyrocketing, my boyfriend caved and tried out a can of Chock Full O' Nuts.<br /><br />Who knew it'd become an addiction? Since he and I both prefer our brew on the strong side, it works pretty well using three level scoops plus one somewhat-heaping scoop to four carafe cups of water. The ratio seems to work well in both our brands of automatic coffee makers, whether we use a paper or gold cone filter. You might want to try it daily for about a week, tweaking the ratio, before making up your mind.<br /><br />It's a good deal if you can find it on sale, although it's still more than brands like Maxwell House.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee snob, but in my book, this beats Starbucks, Caribou Coffee, Folger's, Dunkin' Donuts, even Tim Horton's--at least for an everyday coffee. We both buy the classic, which seems to have a rich, deep sort of taste that's so good to wake up to.<br /><br />Here in Michigan we've been able to buy it in the Meijer grocery chain and occasionally at Rite Aid pharmacy. Unfortunately it's getting harder to find--my guess is that people confuse the retro-looking can (which I personally like) with other cheapie coffees. It may not be gourmet but this brand o' caffeine has become my habit o' choice.
2736	1	I should start off by saying that I have never understood the appeal of artificial chocolate flavoring.  Even when I was a kid and a total junk food junkie, the things that were artificially flavored chocolate always tasted strange.<br /><br />Fast forward to my life as an adult and I find that neither has the technology behind artificial chocolate flavoring improved, nor my opinion of it. It still has a subtle (and sometimes, not-so-subtle) metallic taste and an obvious artificial one. So do many artificial flavorings, but most seem to replicate the real thing about 75-80% of the time. Not so with artificial chocolate.<br /><br />So then, it will come as no surprise that this K-Cup variety is equally disappointing. Imagine the most mass-produced chocolate doughnut with a laundry list of ingredients (and unpronounceable ones at that) and one pretty much has the taste of this coffee flavor---at best.  It's not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that's not saying much.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it's  like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut  or  tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee . No, and no!  It's also a far cry from  cafe mocha , as well.  Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience.<br /><br />It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all.  If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst.<br /><br />I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer's [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor.  I kept hoping it would get better, but such was not the case. It was all I could do to finish the cup of coffee and not throw it out.
2737	3	It is very tiny for the price ....I think if was a case of 50 I would have been happy.
2738	1	I had these cookies in a restaurant. Loved them so I got the name and ordered them. Not the same quality is terrible. They had a funny taste and they were a waste of money.
2739	5	If you've ever priced dog treats...especially the  bully sticks , you'll be shocked at what a great deal this is. I've ordered these 5 or 6 times now, and there is always a different mix, but you are sure to get tons of snack size bully sticks (well, for my labs they are snacks), little pepperoni sticks (good for older dogs...they're softer), chicken and beef jerky, and other pieces of animal that have been stretched and dried into your puppies favorite snacks.<br /><br />My dogs and all the neighborhood dogs give this five stars and two paws up...way up!
2740	4	This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.
2741	5	Well worth the 10-11 dollars. id buy it again no problem. the package came quick and the mini gummi bears came in clutch for about a month
2742	5	Ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic! I can't digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat! I would order them again they are that delicious! Looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers.
2743	5	This product is very good. Out of everything cappuccino french vanilla is the only thing hot that i drink. I bought this not knowing what it would taste like and my husband and i love it. We even add a creamer to it even though its great without it. Its hard to find the right kind and brand but this one was perfect.
2744	1	This is a waste of perfectly good coffee beans.They are roasted light-medium and is very bitter...undrinkable.African coffee should be full-city/dark roast.I do know coffee.I have roasted my own and at first made the mistake of not roasting it enough.The result tasted like this.I would not have bought this for myself.I bought it for a friend and am now going to have to eat the $32 I paid for it,not to mention looking like an idiot.I am not happy.Coffee bean direct will not in any way rectify this,nor will Amazon.I am a prime member
2745	5	I am not a fan of food that is hot just for hot's sake: if it's spicy it also has to be delicious, to have a purpose for the heat.<br /><br />I found this sauce adds a nice touch that even Tabasco doesn't offer, it has a nice sweetness to it as well as a punch of heat. The heat isn't overwhelming or unbearable, it's just a pleasant spicy addition to food.
2746	4	If you like hazelnut then you will love this flavor.  Does not taste artificial to me at all.  I use the 7-8 ounce setting and I add vanilla creamer which turns it into vanilla nut.  Yummy!  It is a light roast but full of hazelnut flavor.
2747	5	This is a super popular flavor with my little one. I can put the pouch in my bag and take it with me on the go. My daughter enjoys the independence of holding it herself and drinking it like a smoothie.  I recommend it to all my mom friends.
2748	5	These bars are a simple and quick way to get some fruit into your daily diet. The ingredients consist of 1 Apple and 1 Pear, and  That's It.  The bars are small and will definitely not work as a meal supplement, but are great for an add-on to lunch or breakfast, or a small snack between meals. The only downside to the bars (and it is very minor unless you are picky) is that they are dark brown in color, but I would expect that when you mash fruits together and turn it into a bar.<br /><br />Overall, these bars taste great, and I would definitely recommend them to others.<br /><br />Other great flavors include:<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056AL5IU >That's It. Apple + Cherry, 12 Pack Natural Fruit Bars</a><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056AL68Y >That's It. Apple + Apricot, 12 Pack Natural Fruit Bars</a>
2749	5	Before you blast the seller, read the description.  This price is NOT for one bottle, it's for 6!!
2750	5	This is a good tasty juice. It contains acai berries that are known for the antioxidant abilities. I drink it every morning, it nicely stabilize my metabolism. I like this flavor the most, it's less sour than the original flavor.
2751	4	This product is promptly delivered in exactly the condition one might expect. It is the same product one might buy at the store. While it may be more convenient to have it delivered, it is a lot cheaper to buy it at the store which is why I gave it 4 stars.
2752	2	As a serious coffee drinker, I should have read the other reviews. My coffee preferences are Bold and Dark blends. I like a strong cup of coffee and this was very watery to me. I brewed it on the smallest cup size and still thought it was weak.<br />it smells amazing. But if you like a good strong cup of coffee do not buy this. My roommate who prefers lighter coffee, really liked this one. She can keep the extras, im going for that dark Roast cup of coffee.<br />And if you arent sure if you are a DARK or a LIGHT roast person, if you prefer your morning cuppa at Starbucks- then you prefer a dark roast. If you prefer a cup from Dunkin or krispy, you like the lighter roasts- so this cinnamon roll would satisfy you.
2753	2	I purchased this product because the pods looked like they were made in a more earth friendly way. There's no hard plastic cup involved. We break down our cups after use. We compost the coffee and recycle the foil tops. The plastic cups end up in the garbage.<br />This product arrives in several heavy plastic bags for freshness. The filter pods are synthetic so they can't be composted and the tops seem to be made of plastic, not foil. The only thing I can keep out of the garbage is the coffee itself.<br />The coffee tastes good.
2754	4	I have six cats and am very picky about what I feed my cats. It doesn't help that I have to give one cat herbal supplements and another extra food since he gets run off from the food dish. It can be very challenging to say the least when the other three are just trying to snarf down everything they can get.<br /><br />I am adamant about a grain free diet but also have to find something that everyone will eat. This is hard because not everyone wants to eat the same thing. My oldest cat doesn't even like canned food. If he gets special treats, its sardines only so he was out when I tried this food. The other boy doesn't like the ground up texture of many canned foods. He only eats stuff that has really pieces of food and gravy. He turned his nose up and walked away. The other four all ran to the plate and cleaned it off every time I put it down. Four out of six cats ate it.<br /><br />The sad thing I find with this food is it talks about all the healthy veggies and fruits in it but from looking at it, the only vegetable I see are carrots. What does encourage me is a cat blog I follow, The Conscious Cat, recommends this as one of her top grain free foods to feed your cat. She is also very picky about what she feeds her cats, and I trust her word.<br /><br />Now, having said all of that, I feel that this is one of the better canned cat foods on the market. Personally, I wouldn't really buy much of it since I don't feed the four cats this that often, just often enough to distract them while I am trying to feed the one that got run off from the food dish. If you buy this, expect to pay a little less than forty dollars for 24 3-ounce cans (as of 10/4/12). That's a little steep for me, but I do feel that the food is worth it for your cats if you plan on feeding them a wet diet.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.
2755	4	My first try of the Namaste brand and we added three teaspoon of ginger to make the ginger bread!  I think we could add more ground ginger as it was not that strong in the finished product.  It was delicious when it came straight out the oven,, fluffy light and sweet.  A litltle too sweet for me, I hope they could  provide a spice cake with no sugar so that I can add my own!  Was not disappointed and will try the other mixes!
2756	5	Used it last night grilling Tilapia  - fantastic results and buying the online 2 pack works out to just a fraction per use of what you'll pay if you buy it at the local grocery.
2757	5	This product works very well. it makes the wine taste smoother and  less bitter .  we did a taste test and there was an absolute difference.  i would recommend this to anyone.  Going to buy a few more as gifts. great for the wine enthusiasts.  considering buying the aerator for the white wine - not sure if it is needed tho.
2758	5	We purchased this assorted box to include with mugs we sent out for the holidays. Almost all the mugs broke (thank you to the local post office), but the tea was a hit!
2759	5	I like a fairly bold cup-o-joe and am completely satisfied with this blend in our machine.  I even brew it for the largest cup (12oz) and it tastes wonderful.  Other blends were too weak for me, but this one hits the spot!
2760	5	This is a delightful cookie with a great taste and low saturated fat.  Anyone with a sugar-restricted diet would enjoy this and other Murray Sugar-Free cookies (especially the chocolate creme's).  These only have around 3 grams of carbohydrates a piece!!
2761	1	When I purchased this product I thought I was buying Ruby Red Grapefruit juice.  Instead this is a mixture of white grape juice, apple juice, red grapefruit juice, pectin, acorbic acid and  other natural flavors .  The result is a sweetish, cloying drink with only the faintest hint of grapefruit and a vaguely unpleasant aftertaste.  To label this product Ruby Red Grapefruit juice isa complete misnomer.Since this product is unreturnable, I'm now stuck with 24 bottles of mixed juices which I hope I can give away or donate to a food pantry.
2762	5	great tuna!  it's the only tuna I buy.  It's the only tuna we eat.  Packed in olive oil, it's healthy and tastes terrific!
2763	5	These mints are great !!!!  I am addicted to them big time. If I hadn't read the ingredients I would have to assume there was crack in them.
2764	4	I have a teacup chihuahua and most treats are as big as she is. This one is perfect for her tiny little mouth and she loves them!
2765	3	The coffee is excellent, but the packaging was inadequate and it arrived damaged.  I tried to get a replacement and failed. It was frustrating.
2766	5	For almost nine years I've followed an eating plan called Eat For Your Type. Foods are classified by beneficial, neutral and avoid. Durham wheat, whole wheat, tomatoes and other goodies are no-no's for me and let me tell you trying to find pasta that that don't have those ingredients is no easy deal. I found Eddie's pasta and it was perfect!!! However, it's not easy to find. How excited I was to find I can order it here! It is a great pasta. The colors add so much the prepared dish. I love it!!!
2767	3	I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good.
2768	5	We have tried several kinds of gluten free bread for my celiac son who is three years old.  This has been the best overall in texture and taste.  It smells wonderful when its baking too.  We use a bread machine on the lightest crust at rapid bake, if the crust gets too brown the bread dries out too quick.  Keep in the fridge after the second day as it will mold after about 4-5 days, but will last alot longer in the fridge.
2769	5	I like to mix a packet of this in a bottle of water and put it in the freezer before I mow the lawn. It is so refreshing when I am done and way better than soda. Also great during bike rides. I am a big fan of individual water-flavoring packets in general and Crystal Light raspberry lemonade is definitely in my top 3 favorite flavors.
2770	5	Best maple syrup I have had.  Im not a pro and bought some at cosco and threw out what was remaining when this arrived.  I literally have been putting it into a tablespoon and eating it.  This product is  out of this world.   I hope the producers dont change a thing.
2771	5	My grandkids love this gummy fruit snack - I love that it is all natural and a healthy snack that they can enjoy.
2772	5	Yum Yum what a delicious treat, and specially with walnuts which are so good for you, fill with omega-3 or 6 good for your arteries. i love them
2773	1	I bought this coffee based on all the good reviews and really wanted to like it, but I found it practically flavorless. It does have some chocolate notes, but what's missing is the coffee notes! I was hoping for rich coffee flavor and caramel sweetness, but it's bland in that department. I brew it in a Moka pot and drink my coffee with milk and sugar, so maybe this coffee would be more suitable to other brewing methods.
2774	2	I didn't wanted to buy anything that was made with rawhide but a friend gave my pup a Dingo and he loved it. So I forced myself and brought my first bag of Dingo Dental Bones a month ago. Stitch loved it! I loved it too because he actually spent a good 45 minutes~2 hours on a Dingo Dental Bone. I didn't really like the red dye in the chicken meat but it wasn't overwhelming. If you actually crack a piece of the chicken off you can still see some non-dyed chicken.<br /><br />So I ordered a second bag of Dingo, just the original red package. The red dye was so strong that the whole piece of chicken was blood red and it even DYED the rawhide pinkish red!! It's kind of ridiculous to dye something the dog can smell! It's not necessary as long it tastes delicious.<br /><br />Anyhow I am on the search for something else, hopefully a better alternative other than Dingos.<br /><br />At least it wasn't made in China.
2775	5	After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but  popped ,  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!
2776	5	I bought this from amazon because it is a great price.  Both of my dogs eat Cesar Cuisine for dinner.  Buying it from amazon means fast shipping and it arrives packaged great.  I have no complaints at all.  This dog food is the best for my dogs.  They love it and cannot wait for dinner to come each night.
2777	3	OK for pureeing in desserts, or crumbling in stuffing, for example.  Not at all acceptable if you want a roasted chestnut snack. For that only fresh roasted will do.<br />But good value for the price, the jarred chestnuts from France are just too pricey.  I don't like that they're from China, wish the company could find a European source.  Probably won't buy again, unless country of origin changes.<br /><br /> BTW, I found these at local supermarket during the holidays, if you want just one package.
2778	4	I enjoyed this cereal.  I will probably get it again.<br /><br />I thought it tasted good and the texture was excellent.  It never got soggy in milk- although I didn't test this to any extreme.  The taste of honey wasn't prominent, but there was a  nut  flavor that I enjoyed.<br /><br />My son and grandson also enjoyed it- as evidenced by the fact that they just about emptied the box during their weekend visit.<br /><br />Now, that said, it's nothing really special- just a sweetened corn flake style cereal.  It's rather sweet- too sweet for my wife (as I'm writing this she just said that all breakfast cereals belong on the candy isle), but probably about the same as  frosted flakes. <br /><br />The ingredients bear this out, with the first three ingredients being  milled corn, sugar, peanuts  followed by  honey  and a bunch of various things they put in cereal- including high fructose corn syrup and salt.<br /><br />So, its not a health food store type product. If you're looking for a American style, sweetened cereal to enjoy, I suggest that you give this stuff a try.
2779	4	Hi, bought the Camano Island Coffee and since it's delivery have been enjoying it daily. Friends and family are enjoying it as well. Although my 85 year old father asked,  if the well had been acting up lately  when he first started drinking the Brazil Dark roast.<br />I'm looking forward to trying other products by the Camano Island Coffee Roasters group.
2780	5	I was so happy to have found these cookies.  They are free of gluten, dairy, eggs, soy and corn and even refined sugar, not something very easy to find.  The lemon flavor is delicious and it makes me feel like I'm having a sinful treat, even though it's not.
2781	5	I've tried so many different Jasmine teas and this one is my favorite. There are some I just do not like. This brand has a wonderful flavor. I have been drinking this for about 5 years now, it is a good deal if you buy this from Amazon on auto ship. You can't beat the price.
2782	5	We love this popcorn! It is yummy. I bought this for my husband as he loves Kettle Korn. Easy to fix just pop into the microwave for a few minutes. Sometimes we mix it with our regular pop corn to give it a little more flavor.
2783	2	This is not good for losing weight. Has high fructose corn syrup aka sugar and quite a bit.
2784	5	Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews on the t-bag version of this item (<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR14WO >Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a>), many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.) But for godssake, try the small size before buying 1 lb of it!<br /><br />When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)<br /><br />Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there was more pu-erh itself than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces). When I peak inside the bag I really see more pieces of this and that than tea (and chocolate + orange should never cost $43/pound; this is what it comes down to). This works better for re-steepings than the t-bags, but it doesn't go as far as most cooked pu-erhs.<br /><br />In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals  eeew . I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor just wasn't there.<br /><br />But I found a way to make this perfect: I mix it with regular pu-erh! <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I >Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> or a Camel's Breath tuo cha works beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the super yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!!
2785	5	I just recently purchased these cookies and after I ate one I had to eat like 10 more! I felt like they were the best mint cookies I've ever had!  We recently got some girl scout cookies (I don't care for the mint kind) but I ate a couple.  They were okay, but I decided to buy these grasshopper cookies for my youth group.  Literally couldn't stop eating them!  They were so awesome!  Loved them!
2786	5	I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.
2787	1	Although this product accomplished the mission of getting my cat to take his pill, the side effect of the horrible diarrhea he got from these was definitely not worth it. He does have a sensitive tummy, so if your cat does as well, I'd skip these or you might end up with problem bigger than trying to get your cat to take a pill.
2788	5	This is a wonderful tea, hot or cold. The ginger and the tumeric flavors blend together. On occasion I drink this to sooth my stomach, otherwise it is good for any occasion. I often add lemon. The strength of this tea works for double steeping.
2789	1	Amazon, are you kidding me? This week at my local grocery store the 24 pack cube is $6.99. It has been on sale for $4.99 before too.
2790	5	We have cereal in the office for breakfast. This is very economical and gives us the pick me up to start the day without sugar. Compared to other cereals, it's a great value for the money.
2791	5	This is one of my favorite Keurig cup flavors, I first tried it at a Co-workers house and I had to get some!
2792	5	I love the taste of it. It gives the coffee a bit of spank! The seller is great too!<br />I hope the manufacturer wont discontinue making it, as they did with the caramel flavor which was my favorite one!
2793	4	This is definitely better than any national retail root beer.  I have had some better, but this is very good.
2794	5	When I first got a taste of this, I was hooked! It comes in a very convenient package and the coffee itself is so NOT instant-tasting. It smells just like it's freshly brewed when mixing and drinking that my co-workers can smell my coffee as soon as they enter my work area. One colleague of mine swears it tastes even better than what she gets in store!
2795	5	Oatmeal is a tough one for people who are gluten-free out of medical necessity. Technically oats are naturally gluten-free. However, oats are a rotation crop with wheat, barley and rye particularly in the United States; your mileage may vary in other countries, making it even more confusing! What a  rotation crop  means is the verboten grains planted in other years pop up in the field with the oats, thus cross-contaminating both in the field and within the harvesting & processing. Gluten-free oats are grown like organic oats, requiring the field to be unused for four years prior to planting, and then processed on specific equipment only for the gluten-free oats.<br /><br />Up until recently, the only option was Bob's Red Mill gluten-free oats. Don't get me wrong -- their oats are great, especially for baking into recipes, but it is complicated and time-consuming to make oatmeal as a dish on its own the old-fashioned way. I've found they rarely come out the way I want them for that purpose. Additionally, they only come in plain.<br /><br />Enter Glutenfreeda with flavored instant oatmeal. Let me repeat that: flavored instant oatmeal. And it's delicious! It comes in several flavors: apple cinnamon, maple raisin, banana maple, natural (plain), strawberry & brown sugar, cranberry cinnamon, and a variety pack containing the first three listed flavors. All of them contain (extremely healthy) flax except for plain. Like any  normal  instant oatmeal, this product can be prepared with piping hot water from a kettle or in a microwave. Easy peasy!<br /><br />I buy this variety pack almost exclusively; I prefer the apple cinnamon & maple raisin flavors and my toddler daughter prefers the banana maple, so it works very well for us. Like most if not all gluten-free packaged foods, it's not cheap but it is so worth it for the pleasure of having instant oatmeal and being able to easily give it to my child.  We both love this instant oatmeal!
2796	5	The tea helped me tremendously with getting a more restful sleep.  I do however, think you should take it when you know you have more time to sleep in.
2797	5	I was very pleased with how quickly these arrived and they are delicious. I'm always on the lookout for vegetarian/vegan snacks and while these aren't the most nutritious snack they are a fun indulgence.
2798	5	Great price for great tasting shelf stable refreshment.  This is tasty chocolate milk in an easily stored  form. When purchased as a Prime user the price was competitive with store cost.
2799	5	Are these really gluten free, because they sure don't taste like it!  There are a few other cookies being marketed as  gluten free  or  diet  but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.  Frankly, even given the choice between these and something like a Pillsbury or Toll House oven-baked cookie, I'd take Lucy's cookies in a heartbeat.  No guilt, no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds, no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist, sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously, Lucy, you need to make them deeper.)  And the inspiring story behind the creation of Lucy's cookies will make you feel that much better, knowing that you're supporting a homegrown business, rather than a huge multi-national.  I can't recommend these enough.
2800	5	As a general statement I do not like Ramen Noodles; however, this is one of my favorite quick and easy meal.<br />I can't find them in the grocery stores any more so I buy these cases on Amazon. It's a great price!
2801	5	My name is Duncan, and I'm a mommy's boy, and she and Dad love me so much that they give me one of these every day after supper.  They taste great and clean my teeth at the same time.  All my friends love them, too! They buy them from Amazon because the price is good.  I'm going to have them get on the automatic sending list, so I'll never run out!
2802	5	This is the one flavor that my 1 year olds will always eat - no matter what food phase they are in. Now that they are on  solid  solid foods I use it as a topping on other vegtables or pasta.
2803	5	This product is definitely a hit with my two finicky cats.  One is 9 years old, the other is 2 years old.  I was trying to find a natural, yet affordable wet cat food for my boys because I noticed that their feces was carrying a potent odor.  I read many sites which suggested natural food, which is better for their digestive system and ultimately fecal odor (as I use natural cat litter without perfumes or deorderizers).  This product has definitely helped me to achieve my goal.  While the litter box is not odor free, the odor has significantly reduced.  The food is super moist and has a good portion of watery natural juice (not gravy), which they like to sop up before eating the food itself.  This is good, as my older boy doesn't like to drink much water.<br /><br />I also notice that my boys do not get as hungry after eating this food.  With my old, highly commercialized brand, they would each eat 3 portions per day.  With this new food, they stay full for most of the day, only needing 2 portions per day, which is even more savings in my book!  Definitely a plus!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  It's a great deal when purchased with Subscribe and Save.  I say, at least give it a try.  If you don't want to commit to a full case, see if any pet stores like PetSmart of Petco have single cans so that you can try it out with your cat(s).  You may also want to try a few flavors to see which are their favs.  If it's a hit, make sure to Subscribe and Save on Amazon!  I haven't found anyone to beat their prices!<br /><br />Good luck!
2804	5	After reading the 'yuk' reviews, I was concerned it would not be palatable.  I made a shake with the same ingredients I use with vanilla flavored whey protein: start with 1/2 C unsweetened original Living Harvest Hempmilk, 4 TBS Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein, 1 C frozen strawberries (or more as they will thicken the shake), 1/4 small avacado (for healthy fat MUFAs!) It blended up thick and creamy just like the whey protein, and tasted absolutely delicious (a healthy taste, anyway). Some complained about it being gritty, but I didn't notice it as being a negative factor.  It is not that gritty. I was very pleased and this is definately going to replace the whey protein with it, as I am trying to lose weight and thought maybe the dairy is not helping me in that direction.  I'll have to wait and see if it is more effective in weight loss than the whey.  As far as storage, I used three 1 qt mason jars, vacuum sealing two that I won't be using right away and refrigerating all three.  I do make a shake everyday for breakfast after my workouts and it keeps me satisfied for 3-4 hrs.  I will definately be buying this product again! Also, some reviewers complained about the packaging, mine arrived in perfect vacuumed sealed condition.
2805	2	Even though there were only 30, I bought this mix because of the stellar reviews.  I hate to be the one who gives only two stars but, it is what it is.  I've been on a quest to find a great belgian waffle mix that tastes as good as scratch or close to it.  Well, this isn't it and not even close.  Cracker Barrel Mix or Log Cabin's New All Natural Mix makes much better pancakes.  I tried one 9oz box for waffles and one for pancakes.  The rest will be given away to the needy.  Don't get me wrong.  It was OK.  It provided nourishment but, if not for the maple syrup it wouldn't have had much taste.  It looked good though.  Nice and creamy.  I realize I'm looking for a belgian waffle mix and have tried a few of those such as Krusteaz.  Still not making it.  So far it's been from scratch that pleases me the most.  I guess it's the yeast.  I realize that I may be expecting too much from a mix.  Today we seem to want instant gratification with everything.  I may not find it for belgian waffles.  I also realize people's taste are different.  Obviously mine are different from the majority of reviewers of this mix.  For those of you readers that are trying to decide what to buy, good luck on your quest too.  And, if there's any out there that can help in my quest, please reply to this opinion.  Thanks
2806	1	I just cannot believe that Omaha Steaks has been irradiating their burgers since February 2000.<br />Here is their link of proof:<br />[...]
2807	2	I was hoping to find a good granola bar sans HFCS and Hydrogenated oils; Annie's usually makes such great stuff, so this seemed a real no-brainer.  Plus, chocolate, you can't go wrong!<br /><br />However... my daughter won't even eat these.  The oats seem raw, there isn't much sweetness, and they're somehow hard and chewy in a bad way.  They're just kind of weird.  I tried one and couldn't even finish it.<br /><br />Sorry, Annie's!  I still love you!
2808	5	I've been a tea-lover for 30 plus years. some teas are too bitter, or strong, but this tea is so smooth and silky, even without adding a sweetener. I would'nt want to ever live without it!
2809	5	The smell of this tea is wonderful. It smells like fresh mango juice. I would describe it as a very clean and refreshing smell, which is how I feel about most matchas. I will also say that I had no issues with clumps. I have been very careful to check the temperature of my water before adding it to the tea, and so far have not had any bitter disasters. The mango matcha has a grassy sweetness that definitely keeps the mango taste. The actual flavour isn't as strong as the smell, but I think that it would be overpowering if it was. I love this both hot and iced, which a slight edge going to the iced version. I haven't tried it yet in a smoothie, but I am thinking it would be fantastic. I did try adding a bit to some yogurt, and it was almost perfect - this was the only time I had clumps, but I also wasn't very patient trying to mix it all together. I would definitely purchase this again, and can't wait to try more from Red Leaf Teas.
2810	3	This is a good tasting product, but way too sweet to drink all the time.  Green Mountain Hot Coco  is better.<br /><br />7/22/08 Update:  Have to downgrade this product, The sweetness is just too much.  I have stoped<br /> using it.
2811	3	but not great (IMHO).  Not quite as strong / robust as I like my coffee.  I do like Tully's - French Roast in particular.  I have friends who like their coffee a little less robust so this will be good for their visits.
2812	5	Desie, our Yorkshire Terrier loves her spot of Iams Vet Formula on her kibbles every morning. We like it because her intestines stay happy.
2813	5	I still like Trader Joe's sweet potato chips, but TJ's pale in comparison to Glories. Maybe the 2 bad reviewers got a bad batch? I got 12 delicious bags of bite sized chips with a normal amount of oil. (I add a bit of salt - no problem for me.)<br /><br />I actually signed up for Glories auto-delivery. Guess I'm addicted.
2814	5	Ahmad vanilla black tea has a smooth taste.  I found that I missed it when I went back to regular tea blends.  I didn't think I would like the vanilla flavor since I tend not to like the cinnamon teas, fruity teas, etc.  Perhaps the vanilla makes the tea less bitter.  I drink it black.  Being in tea bags rather than loose tea makes it easier to have at work.  This is one of those  try it, you'll like it  things.
2815	5	This food is for my 8 year old German Shepherd who has a sensitive stomach & skin allergies in the past.<br />We've tried just about every natural, organic and holistic food in the past with some luck in finding foods that don't upset her stomach or make her sick.<br />The very first days of her eating this food I mixed it in with her old one and there was no stomach upset. She loves this food and licks the bowl when it's empty. Immediately there was an improvement in her energy level *she already is a hyper dog, but now she's even more lively & vibrant*, her coat has started to get softer & shinier and less scratching.<br />I've found a better price somewhere else, but wanted to share with everyone how much we love this food & will continue to purchase in the future for my dog.<br />The ingredients are natural and the company is here in the states. That alone makes a huge difference in choosing the right dog food in my opinion. I also wanted to point out that these are smaller bites so a dog of most any size except the toy or miniature would be able to chew these, even older dogs.
2816	4	I was following a diet where no sugar was allowed.  I tried this product and it has a good taste with out sugar.  I also used to put some other mint flavor herb tea mixed with this to get my own flavor.  Worth trying.
2817	5	A high quality product which is super easy to prepare, and can be used like a pasta. Brown rice is a great source for carbohydrates. Cholesterol free, gluten free and fat free, soak for one minute and the vermicelli is ready for cooking - pan frying or adding to soup. I use vermicelli along with shredded bbq pork or shrimp and mushrooms as fillings for summer rolls too.<br /><br />Also try their brown rice spaghetti. Perfect if you're looking for gluten-free pasta.
2818	5	I use Bob's Red Mill Dry Milk Powder for one thing - yogurt!  It does take some work to get the powder mixed in with the milk I'm using to make yogurt - a stick blender can make it a snap.  My yogurt comes out smooth, thick & creamy without any need to strain.<br /><br />It's also nice to know that if I ever needed milk and was out - I can always mix some up fresh!
2819	5	I could eat almost anything Velveeta, and this new item is no exception. Adding chicken really brings out the flavor. It may not be a high-brow entree, but it's a very good one if you're looking for a quick and tasty dinner with the family.
2820	5	I really enjoyed this cereal.Being a big lover of raisin bran cereal I was concerned that the cinnamon would be too overpowering and mess up my classic bowl of Kellogg's Raisin Bran. But no, they did and excellent job of keeping the cinnamon nice and light as a compliment to the cereal and added in some little cinnamon roll flavored pieces that gave it just a nice flavor that blended in well. I really enjoyed it and would buy more in the future. If you like both raisin bran cereal and cinnamon I believe you will find this one to your liking. Yummy :o)
2821	2	After being warned by another review that reported their shipment was missing items, I took a chance anyway, because my daughter really wanted a venus fly trap.  I figured that 2 out of 3 plants arriving wasn't bad for the price I was willing to pay, since they were so highly desired.  2 out of three plants arrived, as others had warned.  Who knows what happened to the third plant?  Because my daughter was thrilled with the two that did arrive, I'll leave this review to warn others, but will not pursue it with the company.  The Scarlet belle pitcher plant did not arrive.
2822	4	Wanted to try a new tea, so selected Cinnamon Vanilla.  It is good, though will have to get used to the flavor.
2823	3	My dog loves these, and they used to be great but the last batch we got were limp and stale. When I try to break them, they bend instead of snap like they usually do. And when finally after a lot of fighting, I could get it to break (really more by having to rip them), the result was a big crumbly mess. Usually I would go through a jar of these rather quickly. Needless to say, this last jar I bought has been sitting here for a few months, because it's such a pain in the butt to deal with. He still loves them, but I don't feel like having to clean up a mess every time he has some, and I also don't like the thought of giving my dog something that's not fresh. Makes me skeptical to purchase again, because they aren't cheap and Amazon does not let you return food items. So now, instead I just stick to the Plato Chicken Strip Cookies that come in the bag. He loves those too. They are highly palatable, and I love the fact that plato's treats have very few, clean simple ingredients since my dog has had allergy issues in the past. The sticks were just a nice change from the regular old crunchy cookie that most snacks are (the shape and texture and all) but oh well, too bad!
2824	4	I originally purchased these in my local grocery store and loved them, then searched for the items on Amazon where I was able to purchase a larger quantity for a great price.<br /><br />The Via iced coffee isn't quite as good as if went to Starbucks and purchased it directly from them, and it comes already sweetened, so you don't have the option to customize your drink with Splenda, etc. However, if you're looking for a quick iced coffee it's a great find. I have a Keurig and to make iced coffee, even with the iced coffee pods - I either have to drink my coffee ice cold and watered down or slightly warm. You don't have to worry about that with the Starbucks via, it's a powder, so you can have ice cold coffee without having it get too watery.
2825	5	Was skeptical at first. You know how many of those TV special products just don't live up to the hype. This one does.<br /><br />Easy to use. Makes a great and secure pod. Gives you the chance to use your favoriote brand or blend of coffee in this easy form.
2826	3	this product is easy to fix and tastes really good if you eat it the same day.  it seems to dry out easily if kept longer, even if refrigerated.
2827	5	I love Tazo Decaf Chai with almond milk. It tastes just like Starbucks except way less expensive since a 32 oz container will last a long time. :) This is my  go to drink  in the fall/winter and now that I am pregnant it is a nice treat without the caffeine. LOVE, LOVE this stuff!
2828	5	The Vinturi Deluxe Aerator Set was a present we bought for our daughter.<br />She is very pleased with it and it looks good on her counter with the stand and all. (It was on her Christmas list.)<br /><br />We have a plain Vinturi without the stand and use it regularly to decant wines. We seldom think to open a bottle before we want to drink it, so this  opens  the wine and brings out its best flavors and nose instant gratification style.<br /><br />The stand would be a little handier to use and provides a good place to keep the Vinturi.
2829	5	I love all of the HappyBaby pouches because of their fresh taste and healthy ingredients. My toddlers love feeding themselves with these. I also mix it in their yogurt and even make smoothies for myself. This is one of my favorite flavors to use because of the health benefits of blueberries and beets (plus my little ones love the taste!) HappyBaby makes it so easy to introduce my kids to a wide variety of fruits and veggies.
2830	5	Taste just like they say, silky smooth! The higher PH has so many benefits, from the transportation of nutrients to the cell, the removal of waste products and toxins from the body and most recently the studies linking sodium bicarbonate, which is the second listed ingredient in the water, with the ability to kill cancer cells.
2831	3	Product arrived quickly but was smaller than it looked as pictured on the web site.
2832	5	It's a bar of curry sauce mix - not just a spice, a full sauce mix that when mixed with water will thicken up into a delicious curry sauce. It's so easy to use. I like to add it to beef stew for a nice variation. But you could pretty much add it to anything and it would make it taste good. High sodium content though.
2833	5	If you are looking for a good flavored coffee, not too strong yet not too weak, this is it.  Great price on Amazon and well worth the money for all of you coffee lovers.
2834	5	My husband is the main coffee drinker in my family, though I have a weakness for Vanilla coffee.  This coffee smells delicious and has a nice, smooth taste.  There is no detectable  bad  aftertaste that you sometimes get with vanilla flavoring.  The coffee is not bitter (I often find that Starbucks coffee is too bitter for me).  Nor is it too sweet.
2835	5	My vodka tonics have never been so refreshing.  I wish I would have ordered two cases now as my husband and I are going through far too much.
2836	5	We purchased this brand and packaging of pistachio nuts, in the shell, at a local grocer.  However, they stopped carrying them and when I found them on Amazon, I purchased a contained right away.  We are on the second container now and enjoying them very much.  You have to be careful not to eat too many cause they are high in calories.
2837	4	Shar chocolate has are great taste, it don't break in pieces when bit into. The only thing is that it is hight in sodium, so take care. I take it with me when I know it is going to be a long day.
2838	4	This is a healthy, tasty and filling snack.  I feel better having my husband and I snack on these rather than peanuts or highly salted nuts.  We love salt - but we don't really miss them with this mix.  I make small containers up for us to take with us to work - fills you up in a pinch so you don't hit the vending machine.<br /><br />Price is high - but the type of nuts in this mix are expensive ones.  You won't find a single peanut in the mix!
2839	1	This product has excellent reviews (Except mine of course) and was going to purchase it until I read the ingredients...Did any of these people read them????? I don't think so. Sure it's high in protein, sure it's low calorie. But did anyone realize it has MSG????????? Now, I am not going to lecture you about how bad it is for you. I am sure you are capable of doing your own research (Or at the very least you should if you are into eating healthy). My advice is DO NOT BUY this product if you care about your health. In fact do not buy anything that contains MSG. It's poison for your body.
2840	5	I've seen some people compare this to soya sauce, I would say it's savoury sort of like soya sauce but I can't say it tastes anything like soya sauce. Delicious and nutritious when spread thinly on toast. There's a Marmite cookbook on Amazon that gives you many ideas for cooking with Marmite. It also has some funny and entertaining info and comments from famous people. In short, you either love or hate Marmite, there's no in between. If you liked it as a child you will always love it, I suppose it's harder for people introduced to the taste later in life to take a liking to it.
2841	1	Tastes great, but 64 percent of the calories are from fat! Yikes! This is a highly processed product. It's not  health food  or healthy for you, don't let them kid you.
2842	5	This hot mexican spiced ground chocolate is a great defroster for the winter blast weather.  I love sipping this hot chocolate while watching the snow flakes falling.
2843	4	This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.
2844	5	Despite the other reviews, I have been taking these pills for a month now and have had no problem with aftertaste or odor. They are a little large - but easy to go down.<br /><br />Because of the research of coconut oil with Alzheimers [...]  I will be taking these for the rest of my life! They were recommended by my doctor and I would recommend these to anyone that has the Alzheimer's disease in their family!
2845	5	A very lemony and delicious Lemon curd. The texture is not particularly smooth or creamy as some, more dense and geletin like. A little goes a long way, so for the value it is packed with flavor! Dickinson's products are always excellent, and I will buy this one again.
2846	5	I found this product at World Market, but they only carried it for a short time.  I looked on Amazon & found it.  I ordered 6 jars to start.  My husband and I love to spice up our sandwiches with this product.  It makes everything taste good!
2847	5	This is my 'go to' tea out of all the tea brands and flavors I have tried. I average two of these tea bags at my office every day. I particularly like the fresh blend in Stash brand and I think this particular brand makes superior mint tea over other fancy tea brands. My husband and I each have a box in our separate offices and a box at home at all times. Yes, it really is that good- just try it and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />On a related note- we have tried the Moroccan Mint bags and the Premium Peppermint is much better.
2848	4	I got this coffee first as a sample with my Gagia espresso machine a few years back.  I was extremely pleased by the taste, aroma and freshness of the coffee.  I've tried many different coffee's over the years, but this one seems to impress the most when people come over and I make them a latte with it.  it's a little pricey, you can get it at Whole Foods as well.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend it and would like to hear if anyone has found a similar type coffee that i can try. you won't be disappointed.
2849	5	A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.
2850	5	I first started using Sumac when I found some in a Persian food store in North Vancouver, many years ago. Having recently run out of a supply that lasted me many years, I tried this brand from Amazon, which seemed to combine good value and reasonable quantity.<br /><br />When I tasted it, I was surprised at the freshness. The bottles are all sealed under the cap, so this helps. But the Sumac was so tasty, I could eat it straight from the bottle. It has a great lemony zing to it.
2851	2	These bars taste fine but there is a problem with the condition of the product sent. The back of the bars are stuck (perhaps melted?) to the plastic wrapper and can only be removed by scraping off small, individual pieces. I ordered these Cranberry Almond bars along with the Kind Apricot Almond and Mango Macadamia Nut bars.  The other flavors came from a different seller and arrived in great condition, even though they were sent in the same shipment as the defective box.  I won't bother with the hassle of attempting to return them, especially since I ate one of the bars before I realized there was a problem with the entire box.  A real waste of money.
2852	2	I absolutely love my Sodastream because I drink a lot of sparkling water and this has saved me a fortune! Recently I thought it would be great to have some of the soda flavorings around for guests, mixed drinks, etc. However, I have not been thrilled with diet flavors I have tried so far. Of the three I have tried (diet tonic, diet ginger ale, and diet root beer), I think the diet root beer is the best, but is not even close to any of the name brand diet root beers.  Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.
2853	5	Some people mentioned a Different Taste, and the inclusion of Stevia. This is a natural plant based Sweetener, and doesn't effect the taste for me at all. This container seems fresher than the last one I ordered and the power flows and Mixes better.<br />I have done 5 Runs with the new Cytomax, and no cramping in my legs. really helps with recovery as well. easier to sleep after a long run when I hydrate with cytomax compared with Plain Water.
2854	3	My body really doesn't react well to chocolate, so I was excited when I heard about this from The Raw Food World.  I've used it in cookies, coconut milk ice cream, and tea.  It isn't powerful enough in larger recipes (like ice cream and cookies) even if I use entire droppersful so I've had to put in chocolate stevia and carob as well.  I do like it in peppermint tea along with chocolate stevia, very yummy.
2855	1	This product arrived promptly and was well packaged. Sadly I'll not be using it for what I wanted it for. I was seeking shimmery gold to put in jams and on cakes for Christmas. this has zero shimmer and isn't glitter sized either, resembling more slightly large flakes of yellow. Even under sunlight and up to a lit bulb you cannot detect any shimmer whatsoever. Yellow flakes aren't what I expected at all and the pic is not representative of the product.
2856	5	Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.
2857	5	I could just sit and smell the aroma from the top of an unopened container. Perfect little extra to make a good dish, great. One thing: I did expect Nuggets. It is a finer grate than I would consider a nugget.<br /><br />Very good product!
2858	4	My son wanted to try it and I wanted to see how good it was because of the shelf life.  Very long shelf life.  Regardless, it was pretty good.  Not to sweet and the raisins weren't overpowering.  It weighs a lot and is heavy bread but it is good.  I liked it and the only issue I had was pushing it out of the can.  Took a little more force then I expected.  Other then that it is good stuff.
2859	5	this is an all around product. i carry some with me all the time. i live in an apartment complex with 206 units. i'm the only one,that all the dogs and cats great with ( i think ) a smile.  crazy huh?  my three cats love it too.  just great.  jim
2860	5	I have tried many health food bars. None of them are as delicious and rich tasting than these! Power Crunch Bars are the best health food bars  and I will never go back to the grocery store bars.
2861	2	Yes, people will like Pamela's gluten free bread mix.  I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix.  9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)!  This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.  I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes.  I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable.  Just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up.<br /><br />:-)
2862	5	These Creme Filled Wafer bars taste absolutely amazing!!!  They do not have any of the chalky taste of most high protein bars and it is very light and crispy, compared to any other bar on the market. I have a very busy lifestyle with work, the gym, surfing, mountain biking, etc, so bars and protein drinks are a staple.  I have tried many bars and this one is my favorite.  I used to love zone bars because they were crispy and not as  Dense  as most protein bars, but then I discovered these bars and I will never go back.  These bars are the perfect snack when you need protein fast. I take no xplode before I workout so I can't eat anything 2 hours prior to my workout. My workout are usually 1 to 2 hours long and not eating for 4 hours can really put a strain on your goals of bulking up.  I take a power crunch bar with me to the gym and eat it during my workout. Its light enough where it doesn't reduce the pump I get from the no xplode and it's just enough to get the protein you need to build muscle.
2863	5	Why buy coffee in a store?  What's the point.  You can get it here so much cheaper, pay not shipping, never run out.... I'm in coffee heaven.
2864	5	This is the best cat food on the market, as far as I'm concerned.  All three of my cats gobble it up every day, week after week, month after month.  It's pure white meat chicken breast, shredded, in broth.  The vet recommended it for all of my cats, who have different medical issues.  They love it.  Unfortunately the price has gone up twice since I started buying it. It used to be $32/case, then it went to $35/case, now it's at $37/case.  That's a 15% increase over the past six months.  However, shipping is free, and I order 4 or 5 cases at a time.  They arrive promptly, and I never run out.
2865	3	Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty does what it claims - my hair felt fuller after washing - but because it has sulfates as a leading ingredient, it is not perhaps for color-treated hair. Color aside, it has a pleasant scent, lathers well, and washes out without leaving a greasy feel as some nourishing shampoos do. If color detriment was not involved, I would not hesitate to use it again.
2866	5	i read they book maniac Magee with my class and my fith grade teacher mrs.beske when she brought them in my whole class freaked with happy i love the book and the fod YUM!
2867	5	Altoids Curiously Strong Mint®, Cinnamon flavor is THE BEST mouth tingling mint around.  I can only hope they stock it everywhere so I'll never run out of them!<br /><br />J.R.
2868	3	This nutmeg is Indonesian.  I'm not sure if that is what the problem is, but the Carribean nutmeg is different.  Indonesian nutmeg is lighter in color and lighter in flavor.  It's okay, but the Carribean nutmeg is richer in color, scent, and flavor.  And it's crispier.  That's important, because the softer Indonesian nutmeg doesn't work in my shaver.  It's probably fine in any grinder, but not in my little shaver.  The gripping spikes slip in the soft nut and you have to constantly fiddle with the nut to get shavings.  If you don't know what a nutmeg shaver is, return your coffee maker for a refund and stick with Starbucks.  I wound up with this product, probably for the same reason as a lot of you; it's the cheapest one.  Well, you get what you pay for.  It works, nothing wrong with it, but there are better quality products out there, and if you use a shaver, you really must pick one of the other options.
2869	5	These gluten-free brownies match up with Ghiardhelli's Triple Chunk Brownie Mix.  I add chocolate chips to give them a little twist.  My whole family enjoys these.  This is the best gluten-free dessert I've found.
2870	5	This coffee is BOLD.  If you want a kick in the pants then this coffee is for you.  At the same time though it only leaves a very mild bitter aftertaste.  I would have expected it to be more bitter than it is but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't.  I would definitely recommend this coffee for people who like a bold taste but without the bitterness.
2871	2	We had earlier purchased Organic spelt flour from Whole Foods and that was amazing. This packages seem to have plain flour mixed in - absolutely fine and creates reddish chapatis
2872	1	My cats wouldn't eat them even without pills in them. I have one cat who is fussy so this wasn't a surprise, but I have another cat who will eat anything on the floor, including non-food items, but would not touch these  treats. 
2873	3	Dogs like whats on them, after that it seems they are just another chew after they lick all the good stuff off of it. These run large in size ie;medium size if you have a Lab. Next time I get these for my amer.cocker and bos. terrier they will be small chews. One more thing,,,you will either like the smell of these or you wont, I like it and my wife hates it.
2874	5	Just add fresh fruit for an instant breakfast without the mess of cooking or cleaning up! Great item for busy lifestyles.
2875	5	My favorite of the True *** products, I was very happy to find it in quantity to get the price down to what I felt comfortable paying per pack.
2876	5	The product arrive on time and in good shape.  Could not ask for more.  The product is not readily available where I live so this turned out to be a great deal.
2877	5	We had been looking for Ferrara Espresso  coffee and found it at your page.Shopping for this product was real easy and quick through your system and additionally provided us with a chance to view other items we may want to get in the future.The coffee arrived quickly and we have been enjoying it since.Needless to say we will order through Amazon should we need this or similar products...thanks for the good service.Dr De( Retired Doc )
2878	5	Not only are they a great side dish, I use it to make soups too.. very tasty
2879	5	Insanely delicious.  Texture and taste are phenomenal, they are incredibly satisfying (and don't leave you feeling mildly nauseous like actual junk food) and the ingredients are just marvelous.  Mmmm mmm.
2880	5	My family LOVED the Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries, Chocolate Flavor.  They had the organic whole grain goodness, with the taste of a delicious treat.
2881	4	This is the chocolate version of the normal PB2. While this product, like the original PB2, is mostly devoid of the healthy fats found in natural peanut butter, this product is a GREAT way to get that peanut butter flavor into baked goods, drinks, and so on without the added calories and fat!
2882	4	I have a dog that is a Jack Russell Terrier that will eat anything and her weight shows it... So it really isn't saying much that she likes these treats. On the plus side, they are low-calorie and it takes her longer to eat one of the Zoe sticks than it does to eat one of her nightly Dentastix (the two products look very similar) but I suppose the Zoe sticks are denser and a bit tougher to chew through and so last longer.  If they are low-calorie and she'll eat it, I consider it a good product!
2883	5	My husband and I have tried more than 20 different types of K-Cups and I am pretty picky about my coffee. If I am paying this much for a cup of coffee it BETTER taste good. Imagine my dissapointment(since I have tried approx 19 others before now)cup after cup, with bland, boring, tastless and often downright nasty coffee.<br /><br />You know, if you have a Keurig that the larger quantity you buy, the less you pay. So you either buy a large quantity of something nasty or you pay even more for something that will take FOREVER to get through. We have the carousel and this last time I bought 4 different types of K cups. One of them was  Black Tiger  by Coffee People. Now I have to tell my husband that he has to drink three others to each Black Tiger to get rid of the others. I will put only three black tigers on each side and until we drink the others we can't have our 'favorite'. If you like strong coffee then this is  The One .<br /><br />TAKE IT FROM ME,  THIS COFFEE IS THE BEST I HAVE HAD SO FAR. TRUE COFFEE TASTE. I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY JET FUEL, ANYONE WANT TO TRADE SOME FLAVORS?? LOL
2884	4	Delicious popcorn assortment.<br />We bought our first batch from a cup scout and thought it was great. Had to have more. So ordered here and loved it but cheez, costly with shipping.<br />Sent some to my folks for xmas and they loved it too.
2885	5	This is the best sugar out there...I carry a little baggie with some for coffee where ever I go...I have tried many different sugars and this one works in every thing...cooking...coffee...tea...really every thing...I wish it wasn't so hard to find...really glad Amazon.com has started carrying it.
2886	2	I just bought my 2nd box from Costco and decided to compare prices on Amazon.  Thanks for showing reviews...I will not purchase this again since it is made in China!
2887	5	I love hazelnut coffee and have tried many brands - Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is very good. I love being able to buy it in bulk for such a great price.
2888	5	Good quality vanilla beans. The vanilla beans were packaged and sealed well. It was delivered much faster than expect! I was very pleased with this purchase.
2889	5	I am SOOO impressed with the quality, and taste of this product.  I expected some of the dry, tasteless dessicated coconut that I have experienced in the past.  This is delicious as is - I could eat it by the spoonful.  It is great for making macaroons, coconut milk and any recipe calling for coconut.  So sweet and tender - amazing!
2890	1	Description says 45 total whole leaf pouches but I only received 15.  Extremely disappointed and I feel completely ripped off.
2891	5	Buy this product with the upfront understanding that you may become hooked.<br />Who knew I would love this product so much. I've tried the hot Via but was not hooked till this product. I do not like strong coffee so I mix half the tube with 12 oz water(directions say 8oz) fill my 24oz cup with ice so coffee is about an inch from the top, then top off with soy or almond milk. Yum I could have one every day. I may have to try it according to pkg directions but at any rate, I am a happy customer.
2892	2	Artemis is a very high quality food ingredient wise, and since my dog is moving over seas with us I wanted to get her on a food available in both countries.<br /><br />Artemis was very nice and sent samples of the Fresh Mix Adult and Fresh Mix Maximal dog, and my dog loved it so we bought 2 30lb bags from amazon.<br /><br />She ate a little bit of it initially and then totally refused to eat it. She picked out the old dog food from the Artemis, and only ate her dog food when she was starving. She hasn't even eaten half a bag, and the second bag wasn't treated any differently.<br /><br />Two months later she still hates it and has lost weight so I gave up and bought her Canidae, which she loves and eats no problem at all. She is not a picky dog, but she just hated the Artemis - it gave her horrible gas all the time and she had diarrhea several times.<br /><br />Changing her food she is back to being a happy little porker.<br /><br />I don't know if it was a bad batch or what since she liked the sample packs, but it definitely didn't work for her at all.
2893	3	my kids love these but I paid $22.24 for 24 bags on Amazon.  I just came back from Costco where I only paid $12.99 for 20 bags! A whole lot cheaper at costco!!!
2894	5	Ideal for small dogs.  Easy to chew & can be easily torn into small pieces for a delicious, all-natural training-treat.  Mini dachsie LOVES them.
2895	5	2 cups is the perfect size to yield 1 quart of hazelnut milk the way I make it. The nuts are smaller so I suppose that makes them filberts ... but 2-cups is 2 cups. The two I have used have been fresh and tasty so when we get down to 1 left, I'll order more.<br /><br />My recipe<br />2- cups hazelnuts<br />4-5 organic dates<br />4-5 cups of water (how thick do you like it whole or skim consistency)<br /><br />Blend on soup setting (not to where it's hot, just totally emulsified. Then strain through nut milk bag. Refrigerate and enjoy. Use left over  cheese  to make hazelnut cheese...our son loves it.<br /><br />Update (7/1/2011): I have since move to using Amazon's Subscribe and Save option and get a shipment of these once a month. Also we no longer use dates int he milk, just the nuts and 34oz of water.
2896	5	My  husband and I grew up in the Northeast and we ate this soup and we both love it.  Then we found out we could get it from Amazon and so now we order it and we love it.
2897	4	Kind Clusters makes a great cereal but I enjoy eating it right out of the bag any time of day. Tastes great and bonus - it's good for me. I can't beat the value either. Any way you look at it, the product gets a 5-star review from me. <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IW4WFO >Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds,11 ounce bag  (Pack of 3)</a>
2898	2	My daughter loves the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK4F5A >Kinnikinnick Gluten Free Animal Crackers</a> so I thought she'd love these chocolate ones (she's a chocoholic).  But she hated them.  And when I tasted them, I could see why.  Compared to the Kinnikinnick, they were much grainier and a less favorable overall texture.  I can't recommend them.
2899	5	Maggie went nuts over these Instinct Raw Boost Bites, and she is a very finicky cat. Liddy was mildly interested, with a nibble here and a nibble there, and Frankie is just peculiar; she will only eat her dull kibble food. The list of ingredients on the box of these freeze dried treats looks mighty fine, with everything from chicken to ground flaxseeds and broccoli. Each treat is a 1 ½ inch round, with the slight consistency and look of a shortbread cookie, and has a fairly decent smell for the human nose. You can easily break them into 4 or more pieces for your cat.<br /><br />These round treats are for both dogs and cats, and are estimated as 1 or 2 for every 20 lbs. of weight. At the rate Maggie would like to eat these, she'd have to let out the buttons in her fur jacket. It's nice though that I've found something she likes, and that it's such a healthy treat. Thank you Nature's Variety for making a treat made of good, natural food for our fussy fur friends. Packaging is good, with a clear resealable bag inside the cardboard display box.
2900	5	Soothing and light; it's perfect to drink after a hard day or before bed. I buy this tea in bulk.
2901	2	I have used these bags before, but we don't bother with them anymore. Many of the bags in the boxes we had purchased had rips along one side. Also, as others have mentioned these bags are on the small side so if you have a larger dog with larger poops... be warned that you may need to use more than one bag.
2902	3	Its  a great idea and works as intended, unfortunetly even a small bit gives one of my dogs really bad runs. YIKES.  I might try a different flavor and see if it does not cause the same problem.
2903	5	I've had several of the EXPENSIVE fancy coffee makers. They usually die after about a year. My aunt left me her old PRESTO Percolater {about 30 yrs old} when she died.  It has continued to make excellent coffee to this very day. I had trouble finding the filters 'til I tried Amazon.  Now I can continue to have my coffee daily. I feel I'm still having a cup with my aunt Dee every day. Thank you for continuing a beloved memory.
2904	2	If you make your own baby food and have been avoiding added sugar and salt - this snack is not for your baby.  It is un-naturally sweet!  Make your own... It will be nicer on your pocketbook and you can control the amount of sugar!!
2905	5	This is the best iced tea and so easy to make, in 10 minutes you will be drinking the tastiest and most refreshing drink.  Fill a 2 cup glass measuring cup with water,  microwave for 4 minutes,  place the tea bag in the water.  Let sit in microwave for 5 minutes,  remove tea bag,  squeeze bag slightly to remove all the tea goodness,  but don't squeeze it to much, because the bag will split.  Fill a rubbermaid pitcher or a glass tea jar with the spout with 14 cups cold water,  pour in the brewed tea concentrate.  Its ready to drink,  I fill a red solo cup with ice pour tea over,  drink and repeat,  so refreshingly tasty. Store in the fridge to keep it nice and cold.  I also take it to work with me everyday, I pour it into a lifeline stainless steel bottle with a handful of ice,  drink it all day and when I run out I just fill the bottle with water.  So much cheaper then buying something to drink everyday when I'm at work. Its a great deal and its all natural drink.
2906	5	I got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn, wheat, potatoes, flax, fish, and pork.  I had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn't allergic to.  I'm so glad I found this food.  He is finally eating and starting to put on some weight.  It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it for such a good product.
2907	5	My sheltie was starting to snub rawhide bones, even the flavored ones, and I was trying to find a chew she'd like as she can always use something to clean her teeth. I'd seen the Dingo bones before, but the bright red chicken jerky turned me off. Well, now I was willing to try anything. I first gave her a Dingo Dyno Stix, and watched her devour it over the course of a half hour. She meticulously pulled it apart and ate it until she'd gotten every last bit of chicken jerky. Only part of the innermost bit of rawhide remained. Success!<br /><br />So, she'd had a couple Dyno Stix, so to mix it up I gave her a Dingo Ringo.  More success!  She loved the ring shape, and it took her about 45 minutes to get all the chicken jerky out, so it was a bit more difficult for her to get the jerky than it was in the Dyno Stix.  However, once she'd gotten all the jerky out of the Ringo, more rawhide remained behind that she didn't eat.  I tossed it in the trash.  Despite more rawhide left behind, my dog still had a great time chewing on the Ringo, and I'll continue to buy them.  Also, they're a good single serving size for my sheltie.  However, if you have an 80 lb lab, these are probably too small, posing a choking hazard for a dog who likes to  gulp .<br /><br />For those wondering how big my dog is, she's a 30 lb sheltie, to give you a better idea of how long it might take your dog to eat a Dingo Ringo.
2908	4	I love the Antica Italia Aglio, Olio E Peperoncino pasta sauce! While it is delicious on pasta, at our house we love to add it to sandwiches like a condiment.  It adds a terrific zing and turns a turkey and cheese sandwich into a gourmet treat!
2909	1	Tasted way too sweet with a terrible after taste.  I would not recommend this product if you are looking for a more traditional apple cider flavor.
2910	5	This size is perfect for the kids, and also for the adults.  Although, sometimes I am caught eating more than one bag!  Great to put in the lunch box, or just for snacking.  Love the cute little miniature bears, and small packaging.  The plastic tub is great for keeping the little bags organized.  We do the subscribe and save on this product and couldn't be happier.
2911	5	Our 6 year old cat has been eating this food exclusively since we transitioned him from the Science Diet kitten food he was eating at the shelter before we got him.  We simply leave food out for him at all times, and this food makes up 99% of his diet (outside of a few bites of bacon here and there).  Once he reached adulthood, his weight has not varied more than a few ounces either way from a very healthy (for his overall size) 10lbs.  Our vet says that the long-term maintenance of a healthy weight is one of the surest signs of a good diet in adult cats.  He has a VERY healthy and shiny looking coat, is very energetic, and has very few gastrointestinal issues.  Plus, you get the added bonus of all the good the Newman's Own Foundation does.  Couldn't be happier!!
2912	5	My kids BEG for Cheesy Enchilada. I used to be able to find it at a local store, but now I can't find it locally at all!  Thank you amazon!<br /><br />I make it per package directions, and add a can of rinsed black beans to the simmer time.<br />I serve it with flour tortillas, sourcream, shredded cheese, salsa and sometimes sliced avocados.<br /><br />It's always a hit at our house.  We make it 1-2 times a month!
2913	5	I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon. It is low in sugar and low on glycemic index. Has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer. Makes great cocktails too if it isn't relaxing enough for you straight up! Fast delivery and great product!
2914	5	I've tried them all, literally.  I came across this drink completely by accident while I was at Whole Foods.  Looked at all of the healthy, organic ingredients and told myself this looks awesome but it must taste like chalk.  Too impressed with ingredient and nutritional profile, I bought one anyway.  Chilled it , drank it the next morning after my morning workout and I was AMAZED!!  Taste, consistency, and most importantly the way I felt after was incredible.<br /><br />They use complex carbs from brown rice for a slower releasing , long lasting energy source that I actually felt (no crash from sugary drinks).  They use organic whey!!, yes organic whey! protein which is almost impossible to find anywhere and the best available kind.  All the antioxidants and vitamins are a huge plus especially if you work out as much I do.  I'm a triathlete and orthopedic surgeon so I like to review everything extremely carefully before consuming.  This drink is an 11/10 in every category!  Keep up the good work guys and I'm looking forward to another flavor because I drink 2-3 a day.
2915	5	I use 3 ounces of this in my Peanut Butter Fudge.<br />The Fudge comes out so smooth and creamy and has the flavor of Reese's peanut butter cups.
2916	2	I love the Bakery on Main granola but the Granola Bar was a BIG disappointment!  I didn't mind the fact that it was super chewy but the taste is just...off.  I will continue to by the granola but NOT the granola bars.
2917	5	Thank you for making these delicious snacks available to me.<br />They are NOT carried by any of the local food m arkets, here, in Birmingham,Al and I have referred my friends who also want to buy them to Amazon. Hope it works out for all of you.<br />Thanks you,<br />Hazel Pizette
2918	5	these lego look alike's are terrific and very tasty.  the candy is very hard but delicious and no sticky mess.  i had 4 colors, blue, red, pink and green; it would be nice to have all colors as shown.  we used the lego look alike blocks to decorate the star wars cake as well as building and eating.  they were a terrific hit!  thank you.  i would have rated 10 stars if they were available.
2919	4	I have tried a number of different DeCaf K-Cups.  Most are pretty weak and rather insipid.  The Tully's Extra Bold French Roast is an exception with pretty good flavor.  Would I like it a little more bold - yes, but they are probably limited in how much coffee they can put in the container simply by the small container size.<br />Neil Bell
2920	5	These dried cherries are absolutely wonderful.  Wonder on oatmeal, on cereal, in cookies or anything else where raisens would do.  These cherries are better!
2921	5	This is a great gift for a hard to buy for kid. The kids love to open it up and start tasting.
2922	5	This stuff tastes great.  It's my favorite flavor of the three I tried.<br /><br />The sucralose (slenda) and acesulfame k sweeteners do a good job with the fruity flavoring.  Compared to diet coke or any number of artificially sweetened beverages, I think this is the best I've ever tried.  I did not have any problem with aftertaste, which has bothered me with other drinks.<br /><br />The bottle itself (egg sized, btw) is well designed and hard to accidentally dispense.  It couldn't be easier to mix a drink with this.  I fill the glass halfway with water, give it a squirt, and then finish filling the glass.  It mixes so much more easily than powder.  It also leaves no powdery residue, making this much more convenient for cleaning (such as with bottles or canteens).  It also masks flavors quite effectively, such as if you're camping and have purified some water with charcoal.<br /><br />These little suckers are a bargain compared to other beverages, and probably healthier than most alternatives, too.
2923	3	I've heard about how good Oolong tea is for you and I heard this was a good brand so I tried it.  It tastes fine -- not grassy like green tea and not bitter like some black teas -- but I was WAY to sensitive to the amount of caffeine in it.  It kept me awake and buzzing for hours.  If you are used to caffeine, it probably won't affect you too much, but if you're like me, you should get something decaffeinated.
2924	5	I am finishing the set of tea flowers I got and will order more.  Some of the little buds didn't have any real color to them but their taste is really divine.  It is one of those things you do when you listen to Asian music and are in a peaceful state.  Each bud makes about six cups.
2925	1	These chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it (especially at the bottom of the bag. Even if they are trans fat free, they need to be a lot less greasy.
2926	4	I really hate full size fava beans, but these little fellows are really great.  I use them in Moroccan soups, and in various salads and substitute them for garbanzo beans (which we can't eat) to make hummus, falafel, etc.<br /><br />I would serve them more often but they are not my husband's favorite bean and I appreciate that Amazon has packs of only 6 cans because even though they cost more per can that amount is more suitable for the amount of the beans that we use.  I've used Cedar brand before. However, I saw on line that the Canada Food Packaging company is having their foods canned in China now and Cedar brand is from Canada. See their web site:<br />[...]<br /><br />'Nuff said about that!  This is the first time I've used the Ziyad brand, and they are fine.
2927	3	I've tried wulong tea and green tea for weight loss and it does seem like wulong is better.  I've also tried different wulong teas and this one was ok.  The flavor was just average and I didn't feel like it had much potency (the water was a bit pale, not vibrant brite like this one <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081ALNL6 >3 Boxes of Wu-Long (Oolong) Premium Slimming Tea - All Natural Diet Oolong Tea , 100% Pure and the Original</a>.  I did find a reasearch report online that does say wulong is better than green tea for weight loss so I would definitely recommend wulong.  I consistantly drink it every day and it helps to make me feel full when I drink it before a meal.  I also read that it has great antioxident affects like anti-aging and good skin.
2928	5	I bought this granola the other day and just added it to a smoothie. I was experimenting and wow! It tastes like breakfast in a glass! Here's my recipe: 1/2 cup mixed berry organic juice, 1/2 cup organic soymilk, 1 banana, 1/2 cup Nature's Path Hemp Granola Cereal. Blend in blender and you got breakfast or snack you can take with you.
2929	5	The quality on the bones I have been buying have been going down hill. I decided to try these and love them. We cut them in half for a great dog treat. They last much longer than the bones we have been purchasing. I will keep buying these for my dogs. I hope the quality stays the same. Keep up the good product..and the price is right..
2930	5	These treats are my very picky Boston Terriers favorite.<br /> She is also finicky about dog food. So I crumble these<br />treats over her food and she is very happy.<br />The freeze dried chicken liver crumble easily, the beef<br />are not so easy.  Anyway, these treats are perfect and<br />healthy. I usually order two containers at a time and they<br />arrive in about 5 days.
2931	5	This is a new product here in the States and I must say I'm amazed.  Not just pleasantly surprised but actually amazed. I'm a professional cyclist and have tried nearly every hydration / nutrition product out there for cycling and bike racing.  From rides ranging from 1hr - 5hr Orbana has left me feeling the freshest and most  bonk-free  I can remember. I find I can sustain a higher threshold, for longer and recover faster after an effort. Nice job Orbana - thanks for sharing the secret- I'm onboard! 
2932	5	This ginger is very tasty on its own, with sushi, and with any seafood. I signed up for the Subscribe and Save program for this item, which gives 15% off the price and allows you to choose how often you want to receive the product (no obligation, no shipping charges.) Initially, I indicated 6 months, but my daughter and I ran out of it in a little more than a month, so I changed the order to be delivered every month. In addition, there is a promotion until March 31, 2010, which allows you to save an additional 10% (bringing it to 25% off) if you use the promo code ROLAND77
2933	5	We are all addicted to Cheesey Bunnies! From ages 1 to 37, our family of four is in love! Our very picky 1 & 6 year olds can't stop eating them! Way better than Cheese Nips or Cheez-its!
2934	5	I RECENTLY HAD THE CHANCE TO TASTE IT AND I COULD NOT WAIT TO BUY MORE. I LOVE IT, MY KIDS DO AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT I INTRODUCED THEM TO IT LOVED IT TOO. I WOULD LOVE TO TASTE SOME OTHER PRODUCTS FROM CALBEE.
2935	5	The box shocked me. Not sure if I read the amount I ordered but I have enough for the next 10 years.. Thanks.
2936	1	This is just from my experience with my two toy dogs.  I bought this after searching the web for something more economical than Pill Pockets, with which I had great success.  Both my dogs refused to even lick this after a brief sniff and one of them eats anything.<br /><br />I gave the tub away to someone else to try with their larger dogs.<br /><br />YMMV Hope it works for you if you take a chance and buy it.
2937	4	My family likes these soba noodles - they show up on our menu for Saturday lunch without fail. I make sure not to overcook them and dunk them in ice water as soon as they have boiled, to prevent them from turning soft or slimy.<br />However, I have not sampled any other brand of soba noodles nor have I been able to determine how much buckwheat flour (as percentage of total flour) these noodles contain. So I am not able to provide a more objective review.
2938	5	I love caviar, but can only have it once in a great while because of the expense.  My brother gave me a jar of this Season's brand capelin caviar from the cold waters of Iceland... and it was fantastic.  Some of the best caviar I've ever had and I've had some pretty expensive caviar.  When I discovered the price!  Well, I won't have to do without caviar any more.  The eggs are very small, firm, black, and just the right amount of saltiness.  Delicious.  I highly recommend this brand for anyone who loves caviar and enjoys that clean snap of fresh roe.  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDJZEM >Season Black Capelin Caviar from Iceland, 3.5-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 4)</a>
2939	5	I haven't been able to find these anywhere around where I live, so I hadn't had them in years! But they are just as amazing as I remember!
2940	5	This is a great chocolate bar. sugar free and low carb and great taste. not too bitter and creamy tasting
2941	3	When I was growing up, we ate a fair amount of Spam.  Every so often, I revisit those days, by purchasing some Spam and trying to enjoy it. And I think of the old Monty Python segment focusing on Spam. . . .<br /><br />It's not so easy for me to enjoy! Plain Spam, even cooked, doesn't do it for me.  I start out with good intentions of eating it as part of a meal and normally throw quite a bit of it out. So, this time around, I tried something different--a fried Spam sandwich.<br /><br />I cut up and fried some shallots, slathered a couple pieces of bread with Dijon mustard and catsup, and melted some American cheese over the Spam.  And it worked! This time, I successfully fixed something that didn't feature the Spam taste.  The result was an enjoyable sandwich.<br /><br />So, instead of throwing out all the Spam (as has happened in the past), I'm going to use my imagination this time in preparing this for a meal. In the past, this would have rated 1 to 2 stars; this time around, I'll give it three.
2942	1	Cookies were not shipped, or stored, in good conditions. They arrived with chocolate coating deteriorating and the individual cookies stuck together.  There also was no product expiration date so it was not possible to tell if the product was simply out of date.  I would not buy again.
2943	5	Growing up in Pennsylvania, we had lots of wild elderberries. What we didn't sell in a Farmers' Market, Mom made into jelly. I have not been able to find it in stores, so <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5MD8O >Elderberry Jelly: 3 jars Mrs Millers Homemade</a> is perfect. I look forward to having toast and jelly in the morning or for a snack.
2944	5	WE RUN A CATERING AND EVENTS COMPANY AND USE THESE MOSTY FOR CHILDRENS PARTIES...THEY ARE EASY TO SERVE AND THE CHILDREN LOVE THE BOYARDEE PRODUCTS. WE CANT GET THEM FROM ANY SUPPLIER FOR WHAT AMAZON SELLS THEM FOR IN THE SUBSCRIBE&SAVE PROGRAM...AND THEY TASTE GOOD AS WELL.
2945	5	After trying GU gel (which made me gag), I decided to try these beans. The watermelon flavor was awesome, no fake taste like the gels that I've tried. They go down as easy as regular jellybeans. Do drink with water though to prevent stomach upset (it tells you that on the box). I haven't had any problems with them at all, as long as I drink water. They give me the most energy of any I've tried, plus caffeine -- which I really need before a run (as I don't usually drink my daily coffee before running). I would definitely buy these again!
2946	1	My cats will generally eat this but the last two times the cans came bug infested. It appeared that the cans were damaged as swarms of little black bugs came with the food and I threw both sets out. Why, do you ask, did I buy a second time? I wanted to give the company the benefit of the doubt but the second time the same thing happened, after sitting in pantry, when I went to grab a can there were small black bugs inside the plastic wrap covering the cans.
2947	3	THESE TREATS ARE MORE FOR A LARGER DOG AS THEY ARE VERY HARD AND THICK.  THE GIRLS (my maltese) LIKE THEM EXCEPT WAY TOO BIG AND HARD TO CHEW FOR THEM..
2948	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MSONC0 >Peach Oolong Loose Leaf Tea</a>What a delicious tea!  Its quite flavorful, without being overbearing.  It's my go-to tea! I highly recommend it for everyone.
2949	5	I've tried nearly all the fancy brands at Wholefoods and Trader Joe's and even boutique bag-your-own varieties and this is the best organic granola. And when they say low fat they mean it! One gram of fat per serving and all the flavor and crunch you could want. As far as the chew, I like more than I've found in any granola so I'm used to adding my own dried fruit. That said, the cranberries here are plump and chewy unlike the dehydrated berries I come across everywhere else. Obviously, I can't say enough...
2950	4	It occurred to me that sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. I didn't feel like a nut when I sat down to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, but my wife did and so we started undressing the beast.<br /><br />I undid the top of the plastic wrap, she unscrewed the cap, and then I finished the job by peeling off the airtight barrier that sealed the top of the container.<br /><br />And that's when it happened.<br /><br />My wife grabbed the first almond and popped it in her mouth. I could actually hear the crunch of her first bite. She's tough to please and especially cynical about packaged foods that try to appear  new and different. <br /><br />Her eyes lit up.  Whoa, this is good. <br /><br />I grabbed an almond. She was right.<br /><br />She reached for another, and then two or three more. I popped about five in my mouth and went for the full chew. Then she did the same.<br /><br />When we came up for air, we talked about how surprised we were. The almonds were dry roasted and really crunchy. We expected something closer to soggy, like almonds sometimes get. The cocoa coating gave just the slightest hint of dark chocolate, and the sweetness didn't come through until we ate more than one at a time.<br /><br />Maybe best of all was that there was no discernible salty taste.<br /><br />My wife said,  I think they have a winner here.  I took another handful before I decided I agreed.<br /><br />In the end, it's just a nut. But, boy, what a nut.
2951	5	I love this trail mix. I keep it by my bed :). It's got nuts and raisens AND M&Ms for sweetness. These are exactly what I used to buy in the grocery store.
2952	3	I was going to buy this drink because of the good reviews. But after reading the ingredients I saw carrageenan is listed. I thought carrageenan was not a healthy food additive? Any comments?
2953	5	After trying about 10 different k-cups with my new Keurig, this is one of my top 2 or 3.  Definitely strong enough for a nice mug of coffee on the 7.25 oz setting, but not too dark or bitter.  I'm disappointed that its apparently not available directly from Amazon any more.  I see some reviewers got it with Subscribe & Save, which is not currently showing up. :(
2954	5	Joseph's makes an entire line of sugar-free cookies that are just 2 carbs per cookie (about 1 1/2  in diameter).  My personal favorites on the different flavors are Lemon, Oatmeal and Almond.  All three of these are delicious, especially as a dessert while watching carbs - there is nothing in their taste that even hints at  artificial sweetener .  Other flavors are Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter (sort of bland), Pecan Shortbread (more along the line of a Pecan Sandie rather than an actual shortbread).  The cookies are delicious, but because of the size, low-carb dieters will need to have good self-discipline in order to keep the actual carb count down when eating them.
2955	4	I purchased the Plato Duck Strips for my 12 1/2 year old Golden Retriever.  They are chewy, but not hard, for her old worn down teeth and low in calories as she is less active now due to arthritis.  I was very pleased to find them available at a good price through Amazon.  Thank you.
2956	3	I got this just to try it out. I think it is ok, but head & shoulders men active sport works a whole lot better. I use (h&s) it mostly cause it feels like it gets my hair & scalp clean. The clear brand does a fair job, but I will just use up what I have & use h&s from now on.
2957	5	I feed several Savannah Cats, all of which can be very picky eaters. Everyone wants something different and if I change anything about their diet they get upset stomachs.<br /><br />I bought Wellness food trying to get them all to eat the same thing. I was simply amazed. As I gave it to them one by one they loved it. Even my 2 biggest picky eaters ate it right up. I watched closely for any upset stomachs and nothing. They all accepted the food with no issues.<br /><br />I was a little worried at first as to how much they ate as it could be expensive, but within a few days they leveled themselves out. I am just thrilled with the food and their reactions. I will promote this food to all my new homes. The food smells good enough to eat. Hum, wonder how my husband would like to try a new dish tonight :)
2958	5	Having never owned a Keurig coffee maker before, I had no idea what brand or flavor of K-cup to try.  This was an enjoyable way to discover what I liked the best.
2959	5	I tried them all, as did my kids. Let me tell you, I love, love, LOVE these chips! More importantly, my picky  I don't like beans  toddlers LOVE these chips. These chips are PACKED with flavor and they are a snack I can feel good about giving to my kids. I honestly cannot pick a favorite, because I truly liked them all. (The Chipolte BBQ are a bit too spicy for tiny tastebuds, though.) While I don't suffer from a gluten intolerance, I have a co-worker who does. She was over the moon for these chips because they are so flavorful!<br />Dr. Oz recently touted the benefits of beans, particularly for those of us that have reached...ahem...40. Incorporating beans into your diet is super easy with Beanitos! Now, I know what you are all thinking...BEANS = GAS! Not so with these chips. The company uses a  natural, proprietary process that eliminates the common side effects some people associate with eating beans.  So, feel free to snack FREELY and around ANYONE!! :)<br /><br />If you are a chip lover, but are worried about the calories, fat and preservatives found in most chips, I highly encourage you to try Beanitos! You will not be disappointed. These are a great mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack to keep your diet on track!<br />See my full review at www.amysuesplace.com
2960	5	Halo is a top of the line dog food.  I have been feeding my little pup this product for most of her life and she not only looks healthy, but also has the energy of a dog half her age.....she is 10.
2961	5	Bought these as a gift; the person reported that their cats really liked them. This tub is cheaper than the mini containers at the pet store.
2962	5	I purchased this based on a story I read about its nutritional qualities. I haven't used it a lot yet, but for the times I have, I have been really impressed. It is a very light and doesn't burn or smoke easily.<br /><br />For those that want to get away from vegetable oil or one that seems to be more versatile, I would certainly recommend trying this one.
2963	4	As a flavored coffee, I would give this five stars. Since I don't really like any flavored coffees, I deducted a star. But if you have tried flavored coffees in the past, you will probably give this five stars. It was less disturbing to me than any other flavored coffee I have tried, thus the four stars. Other flavored coffees would get no more than three stars from me.
2964	5	I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!
2965	5	I've tried both the Peanut Butter flavor and the new Dental paste. My dog loves them both. The best part is that the Dental paste really has helped her breath. Thank God, because it was getting pretty bad! Definitely a great and helpful treat on occasion for my dog.
2966	1	I received a 1.45 oz package of these drops to evaluate. Not exactly enough to cause a sugar high.  That's nine drops, three for your  daily requirement . All I can attest to is the taste which is alright if you like cheap candy. The first ingredient is sugar, the second is corn syrup. I don't know if it's true but I've read that B12 is most effective by injection or sub-lingual.(dissolving the little pills under your tongue).<br /><br />In my opinion you'd be better advised to buy a trusted brand of mufti-vitamins and a bag of caramels if that's what you crave. If you don't like taking pills you could try the  gummy   candy type vitamins.
2967	1	This stuff is terrible, I order the one pack which should be includes 6 boxes, but I only received one. don't buy anything from this tiger tiger, terrible experience!<br />by the way, I saw this kind of thing happened on other customers, but I didn't pay attention to it. because I think it is just radom mistake, but now I changed my mind. Don't buy it!!!
2968	5	Thanks to my dentist, I know how great this gum is.  I make sure it is<br />always available in the cars and in the house.
2969	5	The first time I ate it, I didn't realize that the beans sunk to the very bottom, so when I was almost done all I had left were a bunch of beans.  From then on I made sure to stir it up occasionally and really enjoyed the mixture of vegetables.
2970	4	Just what I needed. Just wish I didn't have to buy in large bulk. But at least I will never run out!
2971	5	When I was a kid, you could go into a drugstore and sit and get fountain cokes and floats.  Aboslutely one of my favorite memories as a child, was to get a bag of my pepitos (it was about $.25 for bag--and my sister and I got a quarter each) and they were fresh roasted.  Then we would go see a movie--the theater was on the other side of the drugstore.  Yes, over the years I have tried others types and brands only to be very disappointed.  THESE ARE PERFECT!  As the other review said, not too salty, just absolutely right.  My husband as already confiscated 2 of the 4 bags from me--he loves them too--so I am having to order more!! LOVE THEM!!
2972	5	I have never seen pickled jalapeno nacho sliced peppers as large as these rings of spicy goodness.<br /><br />The pickle brine is just right, not too tangy not too hot, just right.<br /><br />After having these premium sliced jalapenos I do not think I will ever buy the cheap cans from the 99 cent store ever again.
2973	5	I had Gastric bypass a little over a year ago and ever since have been having a really hard time finding a protein drink that agreed with me. Either they tasted completely awful or they made me sick to my stomach. After reading the reviews on Amazon for Click, I ordered the Click Vanilla Latte flavor and crossed by fingers that it would live up to the good reviews. I am here today to say this drink is awesome! There is no heavy protein flavor and it doesn't make me feel sick after drinking it. I would recommend this product to everyone who loves the flavor of a good latte!
2974	1	I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.
2975	5	Well, the ingredients list is a little questionable to me personally.<br />However, after comparing to most other brands, such as Nylabone, Pegetables etc, they all seem the same.<br />This is economically priced so it does not break the bank.<br />My dog loves and goes crazy for it, and I haven't heard of any problems/recalls with this product.<br /><br />So overall, it's great I guess.
2976	1	The Taste of this Chocolate almost made me pack up my Keurig and take it Back to the store! I purchased this Hot Cocoa out of excitement when I brought my Mr. Coffee Keurig on sale for Black Friday.  I am an avid hot cocoa drinker and this by far is the worst tasting chocolate in my opinion. It was watery and had an awful artificial sweetener aftertaste. Granted the first time I did not shake the K-cup as directed so I gave it a second try after shaking. Surprisingly it didn't do a d@mn thing to help the taste! On the bright side if you long for a watered down artificial sweetener as an after taste in a drink then this is the K-cup for you.
2977	4	Although a lot of the feedback was mixed on this cider, I was pleasantly suprised. I do however use 2 K-cups on the small cup setting to make a cup because I like the stronger flavor. Will definately buy again.
2978	2	I was looking forward to try cranberry apple flavor but when I received my samples the boxes contained blueberry and mixed berry flavors instead of cranberry apple and tangerine orange. Quite disappointing.
2979	5	This is the best popcorn ever.  I wish all stores sold it but so far I have found it only on Amazon and some Wal Mart stores.  I would rather buy it from Amazon of course.  It tastes great and is also just the right amount to watch a movie at home or to share with a partner.
2980	5	Both the Bold Jalapeno and the Wasabi Soy almonds have taste great and make a good snack or party treat.
2981	1	I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.
2982	1	I was excited to try this coffee; a low-acid organic whole bean in my favorite roast. I was very disappointed; beans were dull with lots of broken pieces and it smelled awful. Taste was even worse than the appearance, very stale with an almost chemical overtone. I threw away $40 worth of coffee beans because no one here would drink it. Thank goodness amazon.com took care of me, their customer service was great as usual.
2983	5	Ever wonder why the French enjoy dipping their fries in mayo? Simply put, because mayonnaise in France is more flavorful than its American counterparts.<br /><br />Amora Mayonnaise de Dijon is unctuous and flavorful, great for sandwiches, salads, meats, and of course, dipping your fries. Bland American mayonnaise simply cannot compete.
2984	5	Pleased with product. Cornstarch and Wondra for thickening left lots of lumps in gravy which took alot of time to blend out with my emulsion blender. Ultratex as thickening agent made for a nice silky gravy. Whatever you are trying to thicken, best result was when liquid was cooled off or cold.
2985	1	I always try to taste any food I give my child before i give it to him. Well after tasting this Juicy pear and garden greens gourmet baby food, I would not wish this upon any child. It tastes horribly bad and I cannot even see giving this away.
2986	5	Not sweet at all.  a little bit bitter but it does the job done when I mix with Protein shake.  works well.
2987	5	I absolutely love Caffe D'Vita Amaretto Cappuccino. I am also very thankful to Amazon for offering it at such a great price.  I save so much money purchasing this item through Amazon compared to what is charged at my local grocery store. This specific product isn't even available in my area. Thank you Amazon and you have a loyal customer.
2988	2	Would not recomend this food, my 3 chihuahuas,an 1 greyhound eat this food free feed, an have lost excessive weight. They eat & eat an still loose weight. My dogs are very healthy have been to vet, vet said its the food. I changed their diet an after only 1 wk have gained all the weight back they lost.
2989	5	Wonderful taste, better price than the store and fast shipping.  Will definitely order again. Nice mild flavor. Why go out for coffee when I can have this at home.
2990	2	My son did not like this very much. It was hard being diagnosed just before 12 years old when he hit puberty it set in. We really enjoy the corn pasta. It holds up better and better flavor!
2991	5	We eat a lot of wild ride and use in soups as well.  This is true MN Wild Rice that has great flavor, taste and very good for you.
2992	5	My senior kitty is able to digest this quality cat food.  Other brands were an issue in terms of an upset stomach and vomiting.  It is well worth the incremental cost for the peace of mind it brings.  Highly recommend!
2993	1	this item arrived stale.  it was virtually uneatable.  i believe it was in stock for several months before it was sent out.  i would not recommend this item under any conditions.
2994	5	I use many types of salt in my cooking but it wasn't until I tried this sel du Guerande that I realized I'd been missing the boat.  This is simply the best.  It has a clean taste of the ocean without the  dirtyness  other salts can impart.  Use it as a condiment, sprinkled on after cooking.
2995	4	This is pretty delicious but I feel a little spicy. So if you are NOT good at this kind of spicy food, you may get some fire in your mouth. :)
2996	5	This was a great product for a great price.  It beats toasting the sesame seeds and grinding them up to make humus.
2997	5	First tried this when I saw it at the local Whole Foods.  And if they could keep it in stock, I wouldn't have to shell out to Amazon for it, but I can't help it! It might have crack in it for all I know because I am ADDICTED.
2998	3	I bought the 3 My Kaps with the brush. Yes, it does leak<br />and it will leave grounds in the coffee. But they are<br />worth getting only if you wish to reuse the prefilled<br />kcups. I will go back to using my solofill cup which<br />works fine except it is a little hard to get the grounds<br />out of the bottom. I also have the Keurig My Kcup that<br />come with my Keurig. It works great but if you happen<br />to want to use a prefilled kcup it is rather hard to<br />remove. It does brew the coffee well though. If I could<br />do it over I would simply order another solofill or the<br />the Ecobrew cup that seems to be the rage right now.<br />Give the caps a 3 because they do not work as well as the<br />other ground cups.
2999	1	Amazon only sent 1 package, and my order was for a pack of 12. This was for Easter presents, and Amazon screwed me out of my purchase.
3000	4	The good news is that this is a very high quality Korintje cinnamon which is great for baking (especially when you are too lazy for grate your own- which I often am).  The other good news, the price and quality are much better than the stuff at your supermarket.<br /><br />The bad news- the pack of three is quite a bit of cinnamon.  While not a lifetime supply, in normal use this should last a very long time.  Still, this spice has been perfect in my muffins and scones and I won't need more cinnamon anytime soon.  Recommended.
3001	5	I have a 15 year old cat. He has been a finicky eater all his life but has gotten a lot worse in the last few years. When I could get him to eat, he would eat a few bites then quit and never touch the food until I put out fresh food. Then the same routine.<br /><br />When I received the Tuna Too Cool I didn't expect him to eat it, boy was I surprised. I gave him 1/4 of the can first and he ate it all then licked the bowl clean. I had NEVER seen him do that before. I gave him another 1/4 can and he did the same thing. I didn't want to give him too much at one time so I put the rest of the can in the refrigerator and I waited 3-4 hours. He laid down next to the bowl the whole time. Then I gave him the rest of the can and he ate it all and licked the bowl clean.<br /><br />I'll be ordering this again and trying the other flavors from Best Feline Friend. It will be my cats only food in the future.
3002	1	Worst product I have gotten in long time. Would rate it as no star if I could.  Simply did not catch a single fly or bug of any sort.  Went to the hardware store and bought the old-fashioned spiral fly paper which was very effective.  Had an unuasual influx of flys in the house this fall and needed to do something.
3003	5	I've been having a love afair with Mary Jane's forever. I used to buy them at the newstand's in a number buildings in which I worked in New York for year's and year's and year's. I retired to southern California and alas I was unable to find them anymore so I bought them on line through Amazon. They are delectable molases candies filled with delicious peanut butter. Absolutely delicious.<br /><br />R Mullen<br />Pasadena, CA
3004	5	This honey is of great quality!<br /><br />It comes from the  Pays Basque  region of Southwest France in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain.<br /><br />I have traveled many times in this region and have tasted a lot of food specialties in the many open air markets that you can find in almost every small towns in France.<br /><br />You can really taste the many flowers used by the honey bees. It has a very hearty taste, great to eat on hot toast for breakfast. I will buy more!<br /><br />Enjoy!
3005	5	This pizza crust is easy to make and has a good taste.  If you prefer a softer type crust, you do not need to bake the crust before adding sauce and toppings.  Instead, after letting it rest for 15-30 minutes, add your sauce and toppings and bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  Turns out great and both my husband and I think it tastes better this way, a little less chewy.
3006	5	Wonderful store bought breakfast food. cheaper at Amazon than my local grocery, even when the latter has it on sale. Stays fresh. What's not to like?
3007	5	Our dog loves this food, mixed with a bit of dry food.  The price is definitely right and he gobbles it up- a win win!
3008	5	These are a must if your pet needs medication.  This price seemed a little high, but they are worth it.
3009	5	I have been using these bags for many years.  Me and the wife enjoy a pot of coffee and sometimes make that on the weekend, but we have different schedules and just want a quick cup (or two) in the morning or afternoon.  MY wife likes instant but I cannot stand the taste of it myself.  These bags are a great alternative!<br /><br />- Tastes like brewed coffee<br />- $0.20 a cup with subscribe and save<br />- Fast and convenient. Stick mug with bag and water in microwave for 90 seconds<br />  and dunk a few times when done.  Some people stick them in a small coffee pot,<br />  but I don't need a coffee maker to clean and on the counter, and nuking is faster.<br />- Like flavor and strength more than the Maxwell House<br />- I take them camping or traveling<br />- They stay fresh for a long time with the individual sealed pouches.  Standard<br />  coffee starts to lose freshness once you cut open the big bag.<br /><br />To save room on the wasted space in the box during storage, you can dump them in a gallon ziplock bag and throw the box away.
3010	5	I have to say I was afraid to try it because of the experience I had with the Grove Square coffee.  But WOW what a difference in product.  This is much better than the Green Mountain Cider and it is sugar free.  The price is right also!
3011	3	We bought the one cup thinking it was the perfect thing to brew coffee for my in-laws and herbal tea and apple cider for the rest of us.  But after brewing a few cups of coffee, it makes everything taste like coffee.  Mechanically it is working fine after two months.
3012	2	Decaf is so hard to do right. These pods are just so-so. When I really want a cappuccino in the afternoon I use one because caffeine after noon doesn't work for me.
3013	5	These have a lot less sugar than other brands, but still a lot of chocolate flavor.  I'd eat plain almonds every now and then but they left my mouth dry.  These are addictive, and I eat them every day.  They make a great, healthy snack.
3014	4	I made this in a regular coffee maker made for pods.<br />I thought it was find - it reminded me most of a breakfast blend.  It was very smooth with what seemed like a normal dose of caffeine.  It's not at all bitter - unfortunately, around here, we LIKE bitter in our beer and coffee, so I probably would not buy it again.  If, however, you like something like Maxwell House Breakfast Blend with a mild flavor, but a bit more caffeine, you'll probably really like it.<br />I love that it is fair trade.  I had to use scissors to open the packets.
3015	5	My breastmilk supply is low, and I tried this supplement, and my milk supply doubled after a few days intake. It works for me with no side effect at all, but I have read some reviews that it does not work for every woman. Everyone reacts differently, hope this helps you too.
3016	5	These licorice vines are very close to the real thing.  Really satisfies your craving for licorice.  I keep a package at home and one in my desk at work.
3017	5	Can't go wrong with Fancy Feast Canned Cat Food.  It's what my cat's prefer and what they get......a variety.  From Amazon...free shipping subscription - a great deal!
3018	5	I'm so glad I stumbled upon this product.  It is delicious ~ just like my favorite pad thai from a restaurant where we used to live!  Its a good size portion for one person.  And its super easy and convenient!  Finally only 300 calories!  Not bad for a meal.  I love it!
3019	5	Whoever invented this product is brilliant. Both my dog and cat love the taste. It makes giving them pills easy and fun. Because it's moist I suggest putting in the refrigerator after opening.
3020	1	This is way too expensive for sour cabbage!  I can go to a grocery store (like the ones with a food center) and get their brand for a fraction of the price!  Why would you charge this much for sauerkraut?  That is ridiculous n this economy!  Love the kraut will not pay that price.  Get the price reduced and put it on prime.  THEN I will buy it!
3021	4	I bought these for my baby after standing in the snack aisle for 20 minutes reading labels. They seemed to have the most real ingredients despite the addition of  evaporated cane juice . When I first got them, she was about 7 months old and had just started solids. I broke them into small bite sized pieces (which was very messy) and she didn't seem to go for them much. Now, she's 10 months and we have started introducing a couple snacks after naps and desperate for a little variety, I broke these out again. I still break the pieces up because we like to  donate  to the dog and I really don't want to waste them. So, I break them into about 6 pieces and she has enough to hold and can bite off little pieces or suck on the end until it's small enough to pop into her mouth. In regards to the other parents talking about choking hazards, I'm not sure how that would happen unless the crumbs got caught in their throat. Or, if the baby took a huge bite and tried to swallow it whole. I would recommend introducing these in small bites until the child is used to the texture.
3022	5	*****<br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits:  Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities. <br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of  Kombucha-Pure , grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
3023	4	I measured out what I would need ( and of course a bit more) for a 14 day trip, of Bustelo instant espresso. Used it just with boiling water or hot milk and water - and it was great. I found the taste as good and maybe better than Via which I have used as a travel comfort often, as I visit poorer countries where Nescafe (not high on my list for taste) is seen as an expensive luxury and espresso is rare.<br /><br />I now think Via is just all marketing and packaging.
3024	5	We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think...and then all of the flavors hit!<br />Yum! They are a bit spicy, but nothing overpowering. Just lots of crunchy, sweet, spicy goodness. They aren't sold everywhere though, I'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live.
3025	5	While on a family camping trip with Josh our 8yr old Golden, we ran out of dog food. Stopped at a Wegman's market in Erie PA to shop for a quality food. Settled on the Harmony Farm's chicken. Josh liked it right away.<br />We've been mixing it with his normal food (Canidae).<br />He's very healthy and playful, his coat is shiny. He's a happy pup.
3026	5	My coffee arrived in a very timely manner. It also came with a cookie, of which I thought was a special touch. I've really never before drank decaf coffee, but I have found myself wanting coffee while watching evening tv. I was pleasantly surprised with the wonderful smooth taste of this  DECAF  coffee. And I was still able to get a good night's sleep.<br />  Kudos to all involved. This was a really good cup of coffee. And, I will purchase it again.
3027	5	Excellent, high quality product. In particular a great way to get your finicky kitty to consume more liquids, as the gravy seems irresistible even for the most picky of eaters.
3028	5	Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food my cats will eat. Obviously many cats feel the same way since the grocery stores are usually out of this selection.  There are many other flavors available; but like I said, Tuna Entree is THE ONLY wet cat food for my babies, Comanche and Lakota.  Thank you so much.
3029	5	My 19 month old daughter loves these things. I love them because they are not messy (my daughter eats them right from the pouch) and you can easily send them to daycare or throw them in a diaper bag. I fall back on these pouches to get some veggies in when she doesn't want to eat what ever other veg I offer her. The ingredient list is simple and short. I feel pretty good about giving these to her, as opposed to other convenience foods.
3030	1	I regret I didn't read these reviews before I purchased the product at Lowe's. The portion of the sprayer that connected to the hose separated during use. I reconnected the hose connection to the rest of the unit, but quickly experienced another failure. It's surprising that the manufacturer allowed this defective product to be distributed so widely.
3031	3	Bubbly, effervescent drink mix. Pour SLOWLY into water! Will overflow. Like pouring pop-rocks into water. Tastes a lot like vitamins that are in these.<br /><br />They are OK. Some of  the flavor comes through, but mostly tastes like vitamins masked by flavors - not a great meld.<br /><br />If you need vitamins, take the separately, unless you like the tastes of vitamins. Acidic, punchy taste. Doesn't set well with an upset stomach.<br /><br />Not my favorite tastes, but OK. A lot like Tang with a punchy, vitamin flavor.
3032	5	Can't find it in stores any more and it works great for me. I can have a glass of tea any time with out having to heat water. It's fast and about 10 cents a glass as comparied to $2 at a local establishment.
3033	5	I sent this to my sister at college, one last so long that I figured she could give some away to her friends.  Perfect because she doesn't have a kitchen or anything so she can turn her water into something sweet with flavor fast and easy.  This is my favorite flavor and hers out of the ones we've tried so far, but they are all good.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I do detect a hint of fake sweetener which I hate, but I guess that's how it goes.<br /><br />It does last FOREVER, so if you want to try several flavors might be better to go to Target and get one of each.
3034	4	The creamers themselves are fine, but I expected to receive them in the dispenser pack.  Instead, there's just a big cardboard box and they're all loose in there.  I'll have to come up with another container to keep them in on the counter.  I realize this was my assumption, but I wish it had been more clearly stated.
3035	5	The cough suppressant in this product is from menthol (10 mg per cup), which adds a noticeable, cooling medicinal taste to this tea; yet, the taste of this tea is so spicy and aromatic that it isn't  medicinal ...like a cough drop.<br /><br />I've enjoyed this lots of times without cold symptoms.  The aroma is healing too, so it's a tea that you inhale the steam from and feel the clearing of nasal passage.  This formula for cough relief is genuinely  traditional  as the brand name says, and comes from a European (Swiss) recipe/manufactured in Germany, and has a fascinating history described on the box.  It's my opinion this tea is tasty without anything added.  Recommended.<br /><br />FYI on the other ingredients, making for the great taste, but ineffective to your cough: meadowsweet flower, wild thyme, licorice root, plantain leaf, Echinacea, elder flower, oil of peppermint.
3036	5	This is so good in smoothies and as a fruit dip. So much better than eating all the fat and sugar in regular peanut butter. I should have ordered two jars.
3037	3	I don't know the validity of the 9.5 PH claim because I don't have any PH strips.  I do know it doesn't taste any silkier or smoother than any other bottled water.  For good taste, I prefer <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4 >FIJI Natural Artesian Water</a>.
3038	1	After subscribing to one of the premium coffee clubs for years, my husband and I decided it was time for a change. We went online and read all the wonderful reviews for this product. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We found this coffee close to undrinkable. No robust coffee taste. No aroma. The grind was large and looked like something had been mixed in with the coffee to  stretch  it out. The taste was offensive - sickly sweet. We used the suggested amount which resulted in glorified brown water. Used more next time and it did not brew stronger. Because we had to use so much, one 12-ounce bag lasted 4 days. We are 2 people who drink 2 mugs of coffee a day each, so even the good price didn't pan out. I don't know what standard all the other reviewers use, but when I drink coffee, I expect it to taste like coffee, not bark.
3039	5	This is the best, most affordable decaf Earl Grey looseleaf tea I have been able to find (and I have put a lot of effort into sampling a variety of products). It is an incredibly aromatic start to the morning-have to stick my nose in it every day. Plus, their decaf uses the CO2 process which avoids harmful additives; as a result, the leaves are broken down into smaller bits, but this doesn't bother me because I think it brings out the bergamot aroma. A routine comfort for me!
3040	5	No gluten, low-carb, few calories, very little fat, and tasty!  What more could you ask for? I'm a diabetic so I have to watch the carbs and found the corn thins.  They are perfect for me.
3041	5	I make bone broth nearly every week and NOW Food Beef Gelatin has become a staple in that process. The resulting broth is amazingly rich. Price is right too.
3042	4	Great cookies. But BEWARE. If you buy them from the warehouse (at reduced rate), the expiration dates may only be 30 days away. Pretty short for six boxes of cookies. I bought cookies through the regular site and the expiration date was 6 months away.
3043	4	If you've bought the new formula of Hill's Science Diet dog food, you may have noticed an extreme fragrance.  It is unpleasant to humans, but the dogs seem to like it (if you get my drift--think,  base of a fire hydrant ).  This is unnecessary because the dogs liked it before and it had a tolerable dog food odor for humans to smell.  The new stuff is odiferous in a disgusting way.  I don't want that fragrance in my house, let alone the kitchen, which is where the dogs eat.<br /><br />This new stuff is probably the same as the old stuff only now you get less of it and it costs more.  Sigh.  So you pay more for less food, but at least it isn't stinky.  The dogs like it just as much as they did before.<br /><br />I hope Amazon will begin to carry this product in the large size.  We have two  mature  labs, so we will always need a supply of this food.  The local pet store isn't open 24 hours and doesn't always have what we want.<br /><br />This would be a terrific item for  Subscribe and Save .
3044	1	There IS a difference! I was under the impression this was a chocolate flavored coffee with raspberry undertones. It's the opposite. I hate the raspberry flavor because it makes it taste like cough medicine. I tried mixing it a hot chocolate mix but it didn't work. That raspberry flavor is very overpowering. Also, it's only one star because I have a tendency to like medium roasts but this is less than a light roast. Watery raspberry coffee truffles with a suggestion of chocolate is a more accurate description. They smell good, though.
3045	2	Been buying greenies for years.  Decide to try the senior version but it made my dog sick.  I don't know if its to soft or what but it seemed to get stuck in his throat that he'd eat some grass to throw it up.  Bummed since I bought a tub.
3046	4	I really only needed the funnel/pitcher, but it was easy and neat to make funnel cakes. I had been using a kitchen funnel, which made a big mess no matter how careful I was. I didn't use the ring because I made the funnel cakes in a small deep fryer. The mix was fine, but I prefer my own recipe. If I could have just bought the funnel/pitcher, that would have been fine and saved me some money, but I'm not disappointed.
3047	4	I'm big on beverages and am always trying something new. I got the 6-flavor pack, and although it would be best to review each of the products separately, I've been drinking them over a multi-week period and wouldn't be able to remember enough of the details.<br /><br />With the exception of Rhubarb (which is exceptionally tangy), all the beverages are very lightly flavored. The issue though is that you can taste the acidity of carbonation since there's not enough flavor to counteract the acid taste. However, I did get used to the carbonation taste and have found myself concentrating on the actual flavor of the beverage.<br /><br />After drinking most of the bottles (still have about 2-3 left), I'm actually beginning to crave them. It's really nice to have a super light soda on hand (about 50 calorites per bottle and fillingness to match). I'm not so sure I'll be buying more because of the expense once shipping is added (I reserve $2+ a bottle beverages for 5-stars beverages), but Dry Soda is a great beverage to have on hand. I love grabbing one of them after I've already had my 'soda of the day'.
3048	3	I am not sure these are that different than any generic root beer barrels you might buy.  They taste fine, have a nice flavor and are as good as the rest.  But don't fool yourself into thinking these are  original  or made by Dad's.  Probably the exact same maker of the generic root beer barrels has licensed the Dad's name and puts a label on these -- and they cost 25-50% more than the others.
3049	3	The biggest riddle regarding this new Skittles product... Who even notices the color of individual Skittles? I don't know about anyone else, but when I eat Skittles, I do so in a barely-conscious, sugar-fueled daze, usually while staring at a computer screen or the television. Rarely do I even look down as I'm shoveling Skittles into my mouth two or three at a time. So while these new Skittles Riddles taste the same as the Skittles you know and love, the idea of making them mismatched colors is idiotic.
3050	5	Used to feed my cat Natural Balance pouches exclusively, cat loved them, but these have higher protein (10% vs 8%) and what looks like better ingredients. My cat won't eat patte' style cat food, only sliced like this. He loves it - gets very excited and snarfs it down - and has no stomach trouble with them at all. Priced pretty reasonably (as 'premium' wet food goes), cat loves it - ingredients are really good - and Wellness is a solid company. Good stuff.
3051	4	Nice new blend. I am starting to like this one. A change of pace, not bitter or too strong but still has a lot of flavor. Try a box or two and see. I have it on the subscription program with Amazon and it works well.
3052	5	Seems France knows what to do with butter (beurre).  If you've ever sampled the delicious butter made in the north, in Brittany and Normandy, you know what I'm saying.  The French are masters of using butter in cooking.  So, in turn, the French know butter cookies.  These are French butter cookies, and it's quite a treat finding them on Amazon. Vive Le Petit Beurre!
3053	3	It's coconut flavored, either you'll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion.
3054	5	These pouches are a godsend. I keep a stockpile in the pantry and in the car. Even on days when my two-year-old is feeling particularly picky, he will eat these up without blinking an eye. I love that they are made with organic ingredients with TWO green vegetables -- peas and green beans -- in one pouch, not to mention the pear for fruit. I also like that the salba is included in these pouches for the omega 3s and extra fiber. I had never heard of salba before, but it is a very nutritious grain that I'm glad to have in my son's diet. These pouches are dairy-free, nut-free and gluten-free too, so I never had to worry about them affecting my son's food sensitivities, although he has now outgrown most of them. All in all a great product and the flavor is a winner, even with my picky son!
3055	5	My puppy is teething and LOVES the nylabone. She gnawed on that since the day I brought her home, and over 2 months she finally wore it down to a level where I had to throw it away, for fear she might try to eat/swallow it. She also loved the edible bone in the pack, which I gave to her in two parts over different days, since she's quite small. I haven't introduced the white bone to her yet, she loved the nylabone so much she didn't even pay attention to the other.
3056	5	The Mexican, Madagascar and Tahitian varieties of this are perfect for exactly what they are described.  After trying this for the first time a couple years ago, we don't even look at other brands.  And, the vendor delivers as promised.
3057	2	Barbara's animal cookies used to taste good.  I think they have tried to make them more  healthy  which has resulted in a tasteless, boring cookie.
3058	5	The ingredients say oolong, jasmine and green teas but I always think there is a bit of sesame mixed in there, too.
3059	5	I was overjoyed to locate these, since I love to bake with cherries!  I had read that tart cherries are in very short supply, this season.  Since most people prefer to purchase ready-made pie filling (which I detest, since these products are far too sweet), most supermarkets no longer stock plain tart cherries (even in plentiful growing seasons)!  For those of you who've never made cherry-topped cheesecake from scratch, I recommend that you do so--go easier with the sugar than is typical with most cherry pie filling/topping recipes made from scratch.  Properly made topping should taste LESS SWEET than the cheesecake it glorifies!
3060	1	I have purchased whole bean coffee for over 24 years.  When I opened the first bag I was greeted with a burnt smell.  This the worst dark roast that I have ever purchased!  I will cancel my standing order.  Horrible taste.
3061	4	I got a bamboo good luck bonsai from Gina's over a year and it is still going strong! They are high quality products that will last forever with the most basic of care. I will be purchasing more in the future.<br /><br />Thanks Gina's!
3062	4	I regard this as a good starter for something more.  By itself, it makes good brownies, with a regular consistency that's neither cake-like nor brittle.  But there's nothing distinguished about the product.  Indeed, if you make it according to the package directions, it runs a bit dry (add about a tablespoon of oil to keep it from getting crispy).<br /><br />Instead, use this as a foundation and build on it.  I've had success turning this into something special by mixing in a few spoons of mint or raspberry jelly.  Or add a quarter cup of dark instant coffee for a special kick.  With either of those, consider adding in a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I'm not kidding: cayenne really brings out chocolate's hidden qualities.<br /><br />If you simply make these brownies according to the package direction, they'll be okay.  Nothing much stands out about them, but theyre better than bad.  But if you grab this opportunity to get adventurous and play with your food, you can really turn this adequate mix into a fun dessert that will keep your family coming back for more.
3063	2	I used to get 25lb steel cut oats from Angelina's Gourmet - but noticed that the shipping charge has gone up.  Now I order my oats from Bobs Red Mills directly and pay less in total.  Cannot complain about the service, I usually get the oats delivered within 3 days.  However, it is more cheaper to buy it from the other place.
3064	4	Beautiful flowering tea with great descriptions of each flower.  I was somewhat disappointed in the size of the teapot.  It is definitely for one cup of tea only.  The packaging is really nice and makes an impressive gift for the tea lover in your life. My only complaint is the size of the vessel.
3065	5	All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry
3066	5	After having lap band surgery, I needed a good protein bar for after my workouts that was low in sugar, this is a great product!
3067	1	This hair oil had a very offending odor....so much so that it made me sick to my stomach...I threw the whole bottle away!!!
3068	2	Purchased an entire case of 12 boxes and signed up for 6 month renewal on item. I didn't foresee a problem going through 12 boxes in 6 months.  However, when they arrived the use by date is only 3 months out and the cookies must have been overheated, because the white powdered sugar is non-existent (cookies have a brown glazed looked). The cookies do not taste bad, and I'm hoping they are not. This item is not eligible for return, so I will just have to use these up within the next couple of months and cancel the subscription.
3069	2	I bought these beans hoping they would be good quality, but I was disappointed upon opening the package to see how many broken beans there were and how much dust was at the bottom of each bag.<br /><br />Those which weren't split in the bag came apart during the soaking.  This means my cooked beans will look even worse<br /><br />I am used to Greek 'giant limas', which soak to become huge and remain whole in the process. Now I've got a huge quantity of a product I don't want.<br /><br />I was annoyed to see that Amazon will not accept returns for food products, because I think this is really inferior quality.
3070	3	Candy gets 5 stars, but buying it via mailorder gets 1 star for an average of 3 stars. I think it is best to keep my money local where it helps local citizens.
3071	2	the cheerios were stale.  not to the point that i didn't eat them but it was noticeable.  also, i can get these in this size for $2.50 a box at dollar general.  i thought it was going to be nice to get them by mail to my back door, but it's just not gonna work out!
3072	5	We adopted a Lynx Point Siamese who had a very sensitive stomach and did not tolerate most food well.  She also refused to eat the several brands of kibble that I brought home, in hopes she, and her stomach, would like them.  Royal Canin 38 has been the best find!  She seems to love it and she has never had  a nicer coat.  We have not had any stomach issues with her since she has been on Royal Canin.  I highly recommend this product.  Ships quickly and in perfect condition!
3073	5	I purchased these with the idea they would go into Christmas sacks and stockings.<br />Then my husband and I ate them all and it is two weeks BEFORE Christmas.  They should come with a warning from the Surgeon General  Addictive and proven to add inches to your waistline .<br /><br />Walker's shortbread is reknown for its rich buttery taste, add some chocolate chips and what could possibility go wrong?  Nothing that my husband and I could find and believe me we did a thorough examination.<br /><br />We have NEVER had a better  pre-fab  chocolate chip cookie in our lives.  Just check our bathroom scales if you don't believe me!<br /><br />YUMMY!
3074	5	I love soft and chewy granola bars, and this is the first gluten free version I've found.  They're delicious.  I try to carry one of these bars in my purse in case I get stuck somewhere without food.  And the previous reviewer's coconut suggestion is great - that would make these even more awesome!
3075	2	While the seller claims this gourmet quality fresh picked Mizuna, I found it nothing of the sort. The product was heavily yellowed indicating nitrogen deficiency and of dubious quality with many dried leaves. I picked through the product and managed to salvage about 1 lb of product out of a 4 lb package that was edible. The rest was composted. Avoid this product. I gave it 2 stars because it was Mizuna.
3076	4	We placed the traps (purchased at Amazon) in each room of the house, and after a month they have caught about 100 moths.  Wish we had known about the traps before our beautiful Persian rug was ruined!
3077	5	Bought 4 packages for my wife and in-laws and they all loved this coffee.  The aroma and taste of this 100% Kona coffee ranks high among all the brands. I recommend to ALL coffee drinkers.
3078	5	SPAM Smoked Flavored, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)Great tasting, if not particularly healthy, convenient, versatile product. Moderation will be the key to enjoying it without much guilt. Cans arrived in carton of mixed flavors of same product, a number of which were damaged and leaking. Amazon replaced ALL, even undamaged ones, quickly. Hats off to Customer Service with a wish for Packing and Shipping to greatly improve techniques so as to avoid annoyed customers and sheer waste.
3079	5	This popcorn tastes fantastic. I just bought this popcorn and an air popper and I'm never going back to microwave bags again.<br /><br />Just a warning to you all though ... I bought 6 oz packs to get more bang for my buck but man 6 oz of popcorn makes A LOT.  Between me and my roommate we were stuffed.  If you want to have movie night with your family though, this is a great size.
3080	5	Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole  organic  thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this  red hot  flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.
3081	5	These are our favorite chips now. No frying (bad) and No baking (no taste). Certainly the chips are tasty either alone or with Rice dishes. I did not even know they had sweet potato flavor until recently. Will be trying it soon. so many flavors and they were not even in the race few years ago. Health consciousness is definitely viral. Definitely recommend this brand.
3082	5	Hershey Hugs Milk Chocolate. If you like white chocolate as much as I do, you will love Hershey's Hugs Kisses, Milk Chocolate hugged by white cream. They really have Cocoa Butter, it is the first ingredient on the list, that's why they are so good. The bag has a great cookie recipe on the back. 9 Hugs equals 210 calories about 23 calories per Hug I have about 4 at a time, just under 100 calories, for those times when you really need a hug. Although to be honest with you I would prefer a real Hug! Thank You
3083	5	I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.<br /><br />I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.<br /><br />Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.<br /><br />If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.<br /><br />Lambert Klein Author of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BSGY8Y >Anti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally</a>
3084	2	as a new dog owner, i made the mistake of feeding my dog super-premium, filler-free raw food and treats from stella and chewys since she was a pup. But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over.  Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.<br /><br />i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with  caviar tastes  that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs).
3085	1	I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find that this product is produced on machinery that is shared with tree nuts. As someone with allergies to peanuts and tree nuts, it would be helpful and responsible if companies that purport to look out for consumers by bandying about the organic label would list this allergen information on their sale page.
3086	4	First of all, if you are a wine drinker, get this.  It works, or else I've been taken by the psychology of it.  I first encountered it at the Sterling winery in California.  Since we were joining the  club , we got quasi-VIP treatment, which included a demo of this device on a newly opened bottle of wine (yes, the Sterling wine store had them for sale for $45).  Wine was poured into one glass from the bottle, and another through the Vinturi.  It clearly made a difference in aroma and taste.  We've since done a couple of blind tests, and picked the aerated wine every time.<br /><br />Now, let me save you a couple bucks.  The basic device includes a small rubber stand for storing the Vinturi.  It is just fine.  The upgraded 6-piece set includes a less-than-useful stand.  It is not attractive enough to leave on display, so it's another bulky thing to store.  Also, we found that our wine glasses were either too short--and we got spashing--or they were too tall and wouldn't fit.  Plus, the stand holds the Vinturi perfectly vertical, which is contrary to the included instructions, which tell you to tip it slightly to the side.<br /><br />So, fellow wine drinkers, get the $25.47 model, and you'll be quite pleased.  Don't waste your money on the six-piece version with the stand.
3087	3	THESES SO CALLED MEGA SIZE SMARTIES ARE THE SAME AS THE GIANT SIZE AND THE GIANT SIZE SELLS FOR LESS. I HAVE HAD SMARTIES WAY LARGER THAN THIS. DISAPPOINTED, DON'T BE FOOLED BUT THEY DO TASTE GREAT. THE MEGA IS IN THE LENGTH OF THE ROLL NOT THE SIZE OF THE CANDY, THE CANDY IS LARGE
3088	5	He loves the Liver treats and the Lamb treats. They're not much to look at (simple cubes) but he starts to lick his lips whenever he hears me get the can!
3089	5	This coffee  is strong without being bitter or acidic. It has a smooth taste with some lovely fruity afternotes. I would purchase this again. Usually I prefer to grind my own. But this vacuum packed coffee was very fresh. I love  this Lavazza much better than Starbucks and Seattles best.
3090	2	the price for 3 12-ounce bags at Amazon is higher than the price for 2 1lb bags on the sbucks website - with the free s/h at Amazon you save a whopping 10 cents over the sbuck price once you add their shipping. Why not walk/drive/send someone to the closest sbucks and save $6.50?
3091	5	I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!
3092	5	I absolutely love these shortbread cookies.  Unfortunately my store is out of them and doesn't know if they'll get them back in stock.  They are plain shortbread...not flavored.  I would order the butterscotch if I knew the nutrition count was the same.  Could someone give me the nutrition count on the flavored ones?<br /><br />The plain ones are:  76 cal,  2.5 fat,  5 carbs,  less than 1 protein,  0 fiber.  Serving size 3 to 4 cookies.<br /><br />On weight watchers these are only 1 point a serving.<br /><br />Thank You,  Eileen
3093	5	This is the best blackcurrant preserves I've had. Strong in blackcurrant taste, mild in tartness and easy to spread. Very rich in flavor and texture. If you like blackcurrant, you'll like this.
3094	5	I adopted my cat from a shelter and this is the type of food they fed him and urged me to continue feeding him. He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.
3095	5	I take a daily tea spoon of hemp oil and let me tell you, this thing killed my toe nail fungus in about 3 weeks and also cured my light arthritis on my hands. I know this hemp oil has trace amounts of THC and im sure that's what helped me with my ailments. I would highly recommend this product and i will order again.
3096	5	WOW !  Got a bad of the APPLE AND BANANA  combo and my daughter gobbled it up !  She loved them !  I had given her some dried bananas from a bag of trail mix purchased from our local grocery store but your product is what I have been searching for.  They are the right size for her to handle without making any mess.  She is able to feed herself and not leave half of the snack crumpled on the floor.  I love the resealable package.  I will keep atleast one bag of these in my car for a MELTDOWN MOMENT.  Hopefully, these will alter her mood and hunger into one of pleasantry and joy.  Thanks for a great product.  My daughter loves your duck on the package.
3097	3	I am in agreement with several of the users.  I can buy any of these flavors for 4.99 online, at the manufactures website.  Why would I pay 8.99 to 13.99 for the same.  This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste.
3098	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFRY3G >Ener-G Foods English Muffins, 14.8-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />This is an excellent treat for those of us with Gluten sensitivity. However as with all gluten free bread, you must toast it.(Do not put it in the microwave for a few seconds). It is rather difficult to slice it into two equal halves for toasting but with a sharp knife it is possible.I have recommended it to several friends with this condition after I shared some of mine with them.<br />I have ordered my second supply. unfortunately, the price has gone up very significantly by more than seven dollars and I dont know if I will keep up with it.I plan to continue looking around (as always) for new and affordable products.
3099	1	There is nothing metallic about this color. It is gold in the fact that it is yellow, but that is it. There isn't any sheen or sparkle. I was bummed.
3100	2	I liked it at first for the refreshing taste.  However, it this product leaves a strange after-taste that reminds me of soap or shampoo.  The color is also very strange.  The color is very pale, a little turquoise-like and almost looked fluorescent.  I would not buy this product.  It is just too odd.
3101	5	What can I say? This is Pomegranate Juice Concentrate at a good price and good service.  I use it in a smoothie I make with blueberries, strawberries, etc. This product is not sexy but it is what it is.  If you order it, you won't be disappointed.
3102	5	This is a really nummy and nutty bar with chocolate goodness.  The best granola bar that I have had and nowhere near the fat/sugar of a candy bar.  Nuff said...
3103	5	having tried multiple (dry, tasteless)bars this is THE BEST!(Although I haven't tried more that two of their flavors).
3104	5	This item looks really nice on my white frosted cupcakes.  I just wish they sold a bigger bottle but then it is kind of expensive.
3105	5	My kids drink this milk as an alternative to soy. They get EFA's and it's very grounding.
3106	4	I get tired of labels selectively enhancing numbers to mislead, so these get a star off for that.<br />Big bolded letters it says:  10 bars  below, in smaller letters you'll see a small pack has 2 bars. At least they have the decency to call a serving (at the back on small letters: 2 bars).<br />The bars are very small, so it's no surprise that this is the case.<br /><br />On a positive note, the oats are organic, as are a lot of the ingredients. The bars crumble a bit much, so you might lose a piece or two to the floor.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the ingredients, and the decent taste, these are a good choice. However, a lot of the time the cost per bar* (10 bars in a box, 2 per pack) is close to a dollar, an honestly, anything over 50 cents is way too much for the size of these, and you would be better off with any of the other products out there that fill you up even more (1 dollar protein bars come to mind - they weigh a lot more than 2 of these).
3107	3	I've been using this deodorant for a few weeks now and have noticed a lot of increased itching in my underarms.  I've narrowed it down to the deodorant.  It only happens when I use it and then don't sweat later on in the day.  It seems to clump up and cause major irritation to the point of burning.  I'm switching back to the  Degree Confort  deodorant as that has the same effectiveness with a lot less irritation.
3108	5	The recipe on the box makes the best cookies! Our three sons and their families always look forward to eating them. We have used this product for at least 44 years (we just celebrated our anniversary last month).  Too bad our local supermarkets stopped stocking this mincemeat product!  They only carry the moist mincemeat in a jar.  Some people just don't know what they're missing!!
3109	5	Great quality wholesome nuts, minus peanuts - which aren't really nuts, anyway. Not as many pecans or cashews as there are almonds. but a nice mix. Sticking a handful into your mouth will keep you busy for a while and fill you up. Low on carbs, high on essential fats and protein. Excellent!
3110	4	I have bought these treats before and my cat sits & begs for them.He doesn't eat the moist catfoods,but this stuff he can't live without.It was a great value at my time of purchase so give them a try for that special kitty,,
3111	4	These spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned, you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards! The first time I ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing I could taste them in my mouth the next morning. So just be careful about when you eat them, especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day.
3112	5	For all those people saying it tastes horrible and is liquidy.. You have to put it in the fridge! It thickens right up and tastes really delicious. I eat it with portobello mushroom hamburgers and sausages and its amazing . I would recommend to anyone who is giving up on the evil carbs! I don't normally review things, but I don't think this was given a fair rating, deserves higher because its really that great.<br /><br />I've been low carb for 3.5years now.
3113	1	The picture shows a package of 10 Greenies but when you order it, you only receive one!  What a total absolute ripoff.  After going around with Amazon Customer Service though, I'm happy to say they are going to refund my money.  I only spent $5.93 but every penny counts and I'm tired of being ripped off by people.  Thank you Amazon and I hope they get rid of this seller completely.
3114	5	During the holiday season I do a whole orange with cloves inserted into the serface, then wraped with a nice piece of cloth & tied with a bow. A few years ago I started a  tradition  with my 2 grandchildren, but found that the cost of cloves from the local stores was really  biting  into my retirement funds. Then,eureka, I discovered this bulk clove item on Amazon.com........it has made this 72 year old grandfather very happy...and the grand kids had a really fun evening, followed by us watching Charles Dickens' classic Christmas tale, Scrooge......
3115	5	I had almost given up on my Keurig when I stumbled upon this one in the variety pack that came with the machine. Finally, something that tasted like REAL coffee! Bold, rich, balanced, delicious. If you like bold coffee this is a must try. I was pretty disappointed in the other K-cups I sampled. They all seemed somewhat watery and lacking in any texture or body. Tully's French Roast is the first I've tried that approximates a freshly ground cup of strong coffee. It's smoky and intense and overall very satisfying. Love it!
3116	5	I buy these often, and I get a pretty good deal from amazon compared to getting it in the stores.  I keep some in my desk at work, gym bag, and ocket book for when a hunger attack comes on.  I like that it is low glycemic too, I don't worry too much about a rapid spike in sugar.  It is very sweet for those with sensitive taste buds.  Not a meal replacement but a good hold off until you can get a meal.
3117	5	This big, delicious, moist and chewy cookie fits the bill for a great on-the-go breakfast or travel meal. Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.<br />Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other  healthy  cookie or pastry-bar type treats: (organic) WHOLE wheat flour. Not  wheat flour , which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies.
3118	5	I just received these today.  I immediately opened one of the packages to give it a try.  I am impressed with just how flavorful these freeze-dried fruits are.  They have a satisfying crunch, like a chip, but so much better for you than potato chips.  I had ordered these to send in soldier care packages, which I still intend to do, but I'm ordering several more boxes for personal use.  These will be great to add to my work lunch everyday, instead of those single-serving size potato chips.  You get 2 boxes of 12 packages with this product.
3119	5	Hi love these granola, I lightly fill the bowl with cold milk, let it just sit long enough to have the milk color and then drink it and scoop the granola out. Delicious !<br />My wife thinks it's too sweet though.
3120	3	First time we ordered or bought anything but Keurig K-cups. This coffee is worth the cost which is less than K-Cups but I rather have new Orleans Blend.<br /><br />Sal Reale
3121	5	I don't really need to review Cheez-its, do I?  We all know what they're like.  D-lish!  I did want to comment about buying CheezIts from Amazon.com.  The price here is far cheaper than what any of my grocery stores or discount department stores offer.  With a discount and a coupon, I can get about the same price as here on Amazon.  But I don't always have a coupon and they're not always discounted... I have a Prime membership so shipping isn't a concern.  I did worry a bit about having a box of cracker crumbs... and that wasn't the case at all.  They were as intact as if I'd purchased them from the grocery store shelf.  If you're a fan of Cheez-Its, this is a pretty good way to keep them in your cupboard.
3122	3	These are ok as far as peanuts go, there is nothing special about them that should make you purchase them over local store bought peanuts, certainly not the price.... Also, the description says  Salty snack, good source of protein, naturally nutritious , these are unsalted.
3123	4	Amongst so many dip teas from India, SriLanka, Kenya etc, this Assam blended has the right strength, aroma, consistency. The paper sachettes do not break or spill out and retain the strong flavor till the last. Try adding some 4/5 tbsp of boiled milk and spoon of brown sugar for best results. Enjoy!!
3124	5	My 16lb pug/min pin dog loves to chew and this satisfies his need. The only complaint I have is that when he gets distracted while chewing it drops on the floor and it's so LOUD.
3125	5	I got this for my long hair male cat who has been prescribed wet food by the vet after having urinary tract problems. I read about Weruva and that the Paw Lickin' Chicken would be good for him and keep his urine pH at levels to prevent struvite crystals, just like the vet prescribed food. The Paw Lickin' Chicken has a lot of water and low magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. But unlike the veterinarian recommended food, it has no byproducts or fillers or grains. Weruva actually looks like food, not gruel, and it doesn't have an unpleasant smell like a lot of cat foods. Weruva costs almost as much as the vet prescribed brand, but Weruva is clearly made with superior ingredients. I will still be monitoring my cat for any problems, but so far this food is working fine for him and I feel better knowing he is on a better quality food.<br /><br />At first my cat was hesitant to eat the Weruva food, but I believe that was simply because he wasn't used to the texture. The Weruva chicken is shredded into fine strips, rather than minced. My cat would drink the juices, as he had no problem with the flavor, but was reluctant to actually eat the chicken. So I had to mix it with the prescription food he had been eating before he would eat the Weruva food by itself. It is a good idea to mix the food with what your cat has been eating, anyway, so they can gradually get used to it. Now my cat doesn't hesitate and will eagerly eat the Weruva food.
3126	5	**Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it.  I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says  Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks , but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like  Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.   And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4  piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a  raw food is the only way to go  preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.
3127	5	I SEEN OTHER SAUCES OUT THERE BUT THIS IS GOT TO BE THE BEST, IM ON MY SECOND BOTTLE! WE CALL THIS THE CHAMP ON THE JOB, ITS KNOWN TO KNOCK EM OUT!!  TRY IT IT WONT DISAPPOINT!
3128	5	I purchased these as an alternative to tuna for a quick source of protein and source of omega fatty acids. They were delicious and quite sizable compared to the sardines I have purchased from local grocers or convenient stores. They did not taste salty or metallic like some of the other brand I have tired. The biggest selling points for me were the fact that they were wild caught and had a relatively low sodium content. I have added these to my automatic shipments. I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes sardines and cares for the environment.
3129	1	This coconut water has a very weird smell and a bad after taste like its an old coconut.  The other coconut water I have had is the Vita coco and it's not bad but it's better than this Zico.  Zico does not taste fresh at all.  If you don't breath, you can drink it down.  I'm going to give the rest of the cartons to my mom; I hope she likes it!  Ewww!
3130	5	I've been eating this daily for about a month now.  Because of its nutritional value, I was determined to find a way to incorporate it into my diet.  For me, two things did not work -- popping it like popcorn [yes it did pop, but it burned too] and boiling it as a stand-alone dish [it's not inedible, it's just not very good]. On the other hand, I add it to palenta [from Bob's Mills] or oatmeal.  With salt, olive oil and turmeric, it adds quite an interesting element to both.  It does have something of an earthy taste that I find pleasant when mixed with palenta or oatmeal.<br /><br />Let's acknowledge something, those of us who buy and try things such as Amaranth.  We are primarily into this for the nutritional value rather than the gustatory delight.  This does not disappoint
3131	4	From a coffee snob's perspective, this coffee is really good.  It's not great, but it's good, and I'm drinking it, which says a lot.  What I really love about it is I'm supporting fair trade, a cause I support.  So I get to drink coffee and help someone at the same time.<br /><br />It's not as good as the Green Mountain National Wildlife Blend K-Cups, which I have also reviewed.  But it's good and I'd buy it again.  Hope this helps those of you who don't believe a pod coffee can measure up.
3132	3	I prefer a dark roast with robust flavor, which this has. But, it also has this odd tartness to it that I really do not enjoy.  This can be offset by using a little extra half-and half, but of course that also dilutes the overall flavor as well.  It is not flavorless by any means, which is, to me, the worst kind of coffee, but I could do without that sour aftertaste.  I'm not throwing out the rest, but I will try another kind next time.<br />Also, I definitely noticed the lack of oiliness in the beans that other reviewers noted.  Maybe ordering directly from CBD would insure fresher beans.
3133	4	I fed this to our young toddler (I know, not the intended audience) and she enjoyed it.  However, she hasn't aggressively asked for more as is the case with her favorite foods.  That's the only reason it gets a 4-star.
3134	5	This pump works well with the Monin syrup bottles.  Just make sure you clean it after using, since the dried syrup will clog the spout. I have banged on the pump to unclog the spout and, to the pump's credit, it takes a pounding and keeps on pumping.  Good product.
3135	5	This purchase is a time and pocketbook saver. Instead of trying to search out dark roast Community coffee on sale, I now have a stash of the prized 1 pound bags in my freezer. My order was well packaged and arrived in the expected time.
3136	5	These are the best candies ever.  I think that the 4lb package is too small to contain the titanic flavor which is contained within.  Do not hesitate and order now!
3137	5	We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.
3138	5	Really amazing stuff and so many kinds to chose from. Arctic White is sooooo goooood. Add whipped cream on top and enjoy.
3139	3	Like most of you, I noticed the black mold problem and was horrified. I tried the vinegar solution to no avail. Then, I got to thinking....Why not try CLR! CLR is a green solution to rid your home or coffeemaker of calcium, lime or rust. I figured if it is safe to use in a coffeemaker then, why not give it a try!<br />It WORKED!! I put in about a 1/2 cup of the product (undiluted)into the water reservoir, let it sit a few minutes and THEN scrubbed the inside with a toothbrush. Keeping the CLR in the reservoir, I ran the unit to steam, the black mold particles started pouring out.<br />Then, I ran it several times with plain water. Particles kept coming. I took a look inside with a flashlight and after a few more touch ups with the toothbrush, the reservoir looked BRAND NEW.<br />For safe keeping I ran it again with more fresh water.<br />In the future, whenever you use your baby food maker, I would recommend emptying out the residual water (this is what caused the mold problem in the first place) then re-attaching the food basket/processor/bowl with the lid on and running the steamer with the LID OFF. You will be able to see the water bubbling, turning to vapor and then the reservoir will be completely dry. This step is KEY as you want to will ensure that your water reservoir is completely dry while you store it. Once this is done, you can re-attach the lid. It's also a good idea that you make sure your food basket/processor/bowl is dry as well.<br />Hope this helps!
3140	5	If you want the Grandkids to  for sure  accept your Sunday morning invitation for waffles or pancakes then Heartland's waffle and pancake mix is a guaranteed recipe for success.  We have only to ask the little ones once.  They even respond to last minute invitations if they know Heartland waffles or pancakes are on the menu.  And with three hungry Grandkids you cannot take a lot of time to prepare the meal.  Again Heartland saves the day for Grandpa (the pancake guy).  The mixing is easy, simple and quick.  You just cannot mess it up.  The ordering of the mix is Grandma's responsibility.  She says the on-line ordering is easy, simple and quick.  You will notice that she says the same thing about ordering that Grandpa says about the mix.  Last minute orders are filled in a couple of days and credit card payment is a snap.  Woo-Hoo Heartland!
3141	5	These bones are great! I have 2 black lab mixes and a great pyrenees. They all love bones. These bones last more then 5 mins and buying in bulk saves me so much money. Thanks so much for this great offer!
3142	4	This is definitely a dessert coffee.  It has a very mild blend of beans and the buttercream flavor lends its flavor to a very mellow brew.  Enjoyable and very palatable, but best enjoyed as a follow up to a meal or as a dessert accompaniment.
3143	5	This the best hot chocolate I have ever had.  I love this flavor.  I introduced it my niece and she now loves it as well.
3144	4	I think this is a good decaf for the price. That said, it's not great. I've had better decaf, just not at this price. I bought the four-pack because I love the regular Cafe Bustelo but my supermarket didn't carry the decaf. The decaf is not up to the standard of the regular, but it's good, and who can afford to pay $12+ per pound for the really good stuff all the time? Not moi.
3145	3	I tried Coombs syrup just after Highland Farms and before Chafee Farm's. Coombs had a mildly unpleasant burnt caramel taste that I didn't care for in comparison, though it was fine used in recipes.
3146	4	The smell of this when you pour hot water over it is delightful; the taste less so, but still pretty good.  You definitely get the vanilla and berries.  There is a bit of sourness; you might want some sweetener.  I do enjoy it, although I find it a little overpowering for a regular size cup; I use a big (clean) coffee mug with this tea.<br /><br />I have to confess though, that I mostly use these by adding a bag to a large pot of green tea.  The resulting flavor is nice, and I get the benefits of green tea without the bitterness.
3147	5	Received in a timely manner and in good condition. My Mishka is a little spoiled (I cook her meals when I can afford it, buy her wellness kibble when I can't) but she ate this willingly. I bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping, unlike the much heavier wellness bag, and she was almost out of kibble. I'm happy with the compromise.
3148	3	Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it.  It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her.  She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re-invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy.  (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.)  It's a cute toy and a great concept - and she did enjoy it - however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem-solving as our westie seems to be.  The plastic bottle and rubbery ball are very sturdy and are continuing to hold up well.
3149	3	I thought this pasta was just okay. I would rather have the regular kind, but I tend to like shells and cheese like Velveeta better anyway because the cheese is more real. This is a sneaky way to get some veggies into kids (or picky adult eaters [as long as you don't tell them!]) but still not as healthy as the real thing of course.
3150	4	These great breadcrumbs were hard to find in the Tampa area, so the order was a house warming gift for my sister, a great Italian cook. The best thing was that I hand delivered them and was fed well. I am sure we will order again - any excuse to leave NY and go to FL
3151	1	While the chocolates from Chocolove may be tasty, their treatment of folks they do business with is anything but. I shop and support small business because I believe them to be responsible to other small businesses they work with. When the management of Chocolove refused to pay for work done for them by friends of mine (also in Boulder), I can no longer buy their chocolate. There are many other small chocolate companies around and from now on my money will go to folks who do the right thing.
3152	3	These have okay flavor, nothing to get excited about.  The vegetables hydrate well, but not the egg.  I like Thai Kitchen's instant rice noodles and noodle bowls WAY better.
3153	5	This product is great. I thought i'd try it and i was glad I did.  It helps to cleanse the liver and kidneys of impurities and you'll be amazed - if taken on a regular basis- just how much better and lighter you will feel! I highly recommend this product.
3154	3	My current favorite is actually Lindt 86%, but this bar isn't bad. I think what I don't love about it are the fruity undertones which would probably make some people love it.<br />It melts smoothly, but I wouldn't exactly describe it as creamy. It feels somewhat waxy - which I'm not crazy about.
3155	4	I like the fruit in this rice with just about everything.  It adds a little mystery to chili or a stir fry. I like to have lots of this on hand, because it's easy to alter indifferent ways.
3156	1	I read all the reviews before buying this product.  I can not tell a difference by taking this supplement.  I think it may have caused upset stomach.  For the caling effect I have noticed nothing.  I have been taking a week and a half and will allow more time
3157	5	I loved this for summer it's really yummy.But I drink caramel latte and the hot chocolate in the fall-winter.This has a nice light and airy sweetness and a strong shot of coffee flavor.
3158	5	I just got these today, I ordered the Parmesan. They are pretty good, I would rather have cheez-its or my favorite chips, but if you are really trying to eat healthier and add protein to your diet, these are really good. The whole bag is about 150 calories, and over 10 grams of protein, and there are enough in each bag for a good snack. I will order again.
3159	1	Several K-Cups were crushed and unusable.  This did not happen during shipping.  These were clearly purposely placed in the order so that they could sell otherwise unsalable merchandise.<br />The packaging was fine.  These crushed K-Cups were in the middle of the bag, surrounded by undamaged K-cups.<br />Also, there were 8 of the same K-Cup, and then 6 of another.<br />There was NO Mudslide, Caramel Vanilla Cream, French Vanilla, Mocha Nut Fudge, Hawaiian Hazelnut, Jamaica Me Crazy, Vanilla Francaise, or Butter Toffee K-Cups.  8 of the advertised flavors were not present.<br />There were 9 K-Cup flavors that are not on the list of included K-Cups.  These included unpopular flavors.<br />This was pretty much a complete rip-off.
3160	5	These are delicious, they did not last long. I brought them into work and between me, my coworkers and a 5 year old, they were gone. The selection of fruits in the mix is well balanced and they are easy to take with you (if you get the chance) in the bags.
3161	5	It's got great taste.  I thought it was a bit expensive at first, but Teeccino is so strong you get more for your money then regular coffee.  It didn't take long to adjust to its non-caffeine ingredients.
3162	5	This salmon product was a nice surprise. Because thay did not add salt you could enjoy the flavor of the salmon that is not salted up. It is hard to find caned fish products with no or low salt added in many stores.
3163	2	I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.
3164	5	If you've ever made popcorn in a machine you know what a pain it can be to get the right seasoning, the right oil taste and order decent popcorn that pops the way it should.  Once we started ordering the Great Northern Popcorn packets we didn't have to worry about it anymore.  It is so easy to make popcorn now because we don't have to measure anything or worry about the mess.  One easy step and we have perfect popcorn.  The kids can even do it!  I would definitely recommend giving this a try.
3165	5	The cookies (crackers) are about as round as a baseball.  They are crispy and crumbly like a graham cracker.  I shared both boxes I received with my co-workers and the comment I heard most often was that they tasted like a graham cracker. I also heard quite often,  Mmmmm, I would buy these.   We tasted both these and the honey-fig flavor and this was the favorite.<br /><br />I thought they tasted very nice. The cranberries added just the right amount of tart to the cookie.<br /><br />If healthy was a taste then that is what I would describe them as. They aren't unhealthy from what I can tell but they aren't exactly low fat or low calorie.  5gs of fat. 140 calories.<br /><br />They really did make for a nice little snack.
3166	5	This is the good kind of fat, and tastes great.<br />I actually like the taste better than butter.  It has a similar quality- rich, indulgent, blends well with foods, and it is way healthier than butter.  Not as aggressive tasting as olive oil.<br />I have substituted it for butter every chance I get, with good results. (disclaimer- I'm not much of a cook...)<br /><br />Please buy this, so Amazon will keep it in stock for me.  It costs much more in stores, and is hard to find
3167	5	I was a bit skeptical...pomegranite licorice? Well let me tell you, this stuff is the bomb! Not too sweet, not too tart with true pomegranite flavor and the perfect consistency and chew. This package did not last long at our house. After this package was devoured, there were lots of requests for  more !
3168	5	This cereal is awesome, especially if you mix in with Cocoa Krispies.  4 boxes for about $10 with free shipping - how can you pass that up?!?!  I'll continue to buy this every 2-3 months, and you can even save more with a subscription!  Thanks Amazon!
3169	5	Seeing a Jamaican coffee label, I assumed this would be a STRONG brew.  In actuality, it is a relatively weak brew.  It has a very nice aroma, and the flavor is well-suited to those who like cream and sugar in coffee (in other words, not bitter).  Aside from the flavor, the package is fantastic!  One pad into the coffee maker, dump the pad into the trash, and viola, cleanup almost complete.  So much easier than filter and grounds.  Less mess, more stars!
3170	2	When I received it and soon after opened it, the matcha appears a pale green, as if it has been sitting in storage too long before they sent it. DoMatcha, on the other hand, when I first bought it was bright green and fresher.<br /><br />Not into this brand --  I prefer DoMatcha. . .
3171	5	This product is perfect for what I needed--something easy on my digestive system that would help with muscle cramps.  It's very effective, and even better, it tastes good.
3172	4	Both previous reviewers rated this very low b/c they claim these drag&eacute;es cause cancer... not true. They may be referring to the SILVER or GOLD drag&eacute;es that are not longer available in CA b/c the FDA ruled that b/c there is trace amount of metal, they must state it's for decoration only, though people have been eating these for centuries... you get more metal in tap water and cooking in pans than from the few cookies you eat decorated with these during occassional celebrations. (BTW, the CA law can be traced to one lawyer who made this his sole platform... google it.)<br />These PEARL drag&eacute;es are perfectly safe and do not fall under the same FDA restrictions and are still available in most baking supply shops (who've pulled the metallic ones off their shelves just avoid legal trouble.) While those who are looking for this product will probably already know this, those who are exploring new ideas for decorating will benefit from learning the truth. (The only reason I don't rate this higher is b/c of shipping rates.) Happy Baking!
3173	5	Since I am not inclined to brush my dog's teeth, the dental chews are a godsend. My dog loves them and they keep her teeth looking great! Her tail starts wagging as soon as I pick up the bag.
3174	5	Newman's Own and I have had a really good relationship thus far; I have at least liked, and most usually loved, every product I have tried from them. Their organic ginger snaps are no exception. The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that. If you're unfamiliar with the Newman's Own brand, it was co-founded by Paul Newman as a company where all profits from their food items go to various charities after taxes. It's a great cause that has fantastic, healthy, and quality products that while may be a bit pricier than other brands, won't break the bank.<br /><br />A little note, you might want to have a glass of milk, or cup of tea or coffee hanging around, because these ginger snaps really do snap back!
3175	5	we decided to check on Amazon for this cereal as we realized there was too much variability in its prices in the grocery stores- as a result, we were hoarding too many boxes when the deals were on. We got a great deal on Amazon grocery, competitive with buying in a store on a deal, and the free shipping was a bonus with the subscription! The boxes arrived on time and in good condition- the cereal was, contrary to our expectations, not powdered.<br /><br />Do remember before you sign up for subscriptions that upon subscibing, all your orders will have 15% off, but the price of the item itself is subject to change. Also, the 2-day free shiping is only on the first order- it is free ground shipping on the subsequent ones.<br /><br />That said, happy munching!
3176	5	I always enjoyed hazelnut coffee at he donut shop and to now have the coffee at home is a good reason to get up in the morning.  While the<br />coffee is brewing the aroma fills the kitchen.  It is really good.
3177	5	Wolf brand has been a favorite for my wife for years.  Nathan's hot dogs with WB chili is a must.  The little extra note and book included in the package made the experience just perfect.
3178	4	The flavor is terrific, but I'm a little disappointed that it's not more of natural product.  I'm on the fence on whether I'd use it again.  On one hand it really is a terrific, yummy product, but I don't like that it's not more natural.<br /><br />Bottom line - If you don't care about the ingredients, this product is very,very good.
3179	5	Healthy plant received on time.  No issues, just the way I like it.  :-)
3180	5	Was surprised at good taste and very lean cuts. Wish they were thicker,<br />like meater buger. Cost was very good, will order more in future.
3181	5	MMmmmmmMINT Matcha is JUST what I needed to help round off my matcha supply!<br /><br />I love mint but need to be in the mood for it. Luckly for me that mood comes fairly often!<br /><br />Mint is eye opening, awakening, and also helps soothe a troubled tummy.<br /><br />We had some really good Japanese food last night at a great restaurant but all of us were having some tummy  issues  last evening after dinner. This mornings mint matcha is really helping to settle the tummy woes.<br /><br />When I opened my bag from Red Leaf Tea the aroma was striking! I instantly thought  ohhhh yessss this is IT . It had some slight resemblance to Spearmint gum, and while I do detect a slight peppermint flavor here I would have to say the mint used is mostly spearmint. For those who know their mints some really prefer one type of mint over another. Spearmint to me is sweeter than peppermint and there is less of a bite to it. Some may beg to differ since most people are used to peppermint candies but in its true form I find peppermint to have more bite, sharper than spearmint and spearmint more sweet naturally. Regardless of what type of mint you prefer I have to say this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf does in fact taste very natural!<br /><br />Yet at the same time it is an excellent mixer as well. Of course you will want to use a little less mint matcha in your blend along with another matcha but I choose to blend mint with mocha this morning. The mocha I used a full scoop and the mint just a half of a scoop. I can taste the mocha very well and the mint does not totally over power it.<br /><br />This mint does not in any way taste like mouth wash or toothpaste. It is quite enjoyable. I am so glad that I purchased this one and will absolutely keep this as a stash regular.<br /><br />Also I notice that the mocha base is providing a nice creamy backdrop to the mint matcha! Ohhhh I MUST try a french vanilla / mint blend as soon as possible - I am thinking  Grasshopper  flavored matcha here! Oh yeah!<br /><br />So all in all I could not be happier that I went for it and grabbed this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf!
3182	5	Cheddar cheese popchips have 3 to 4 grams of fat and taste better than the real thing!  Highly recommended.
3183	5	I can't wait to try this product, but I'll just have to wait until the baby is born! I'll update in June. I can say the shipping was extremely fast, and arrived in perfect condition.
3184	5	I love the crisp tooth these have. They are also not over cooked, so they have a clean, deep peanut taste. These are what gourmet peanuts are all about. The texture and taste superiority is well worth the cost difference to store brands. I eat allot of peanuts and these are my brand of choice.
3185	5	Flakes sit on top of meat as its cooked lessening dry-out as normal salt is known for.  Webber Chefs recommend salting your beef for flavor.  Hard to find locally.
3186	4	I almost didn't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful.  But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.<br /><br />I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5.  The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it.  I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good.  I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories.  Very cool!<br /><br />I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles?  I think I'll try that tomorrow.
3187	5	No gristle, not too tough, just right. Nice smokey flavor. Busted this out on a camping trip and it vanished. Will definetely buy again.
3188	5	Unique salsa for many dishes, though it's especially good on Costa Rican rice and beans. It's an authentic taste that we discovered on our trip to Costa Rica. We have not been able to find it in stores in this country.
3189	4	My husband brought home a can of McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. He got it from a co-worker. At first, I thought it would be too much work. Then, I made the first pot and then another and another. This oatmeal beats all others and the wait is well worth it! It is a good value for the money and the Oats are high quality.
3190	3	I've worked with different types of fondants and if you are reading reviews because you are new to the Fondant Cake process, here are some things to keep in mind:<br />1. Satin Ice is Yummier than most<br />2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many<br />3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;)<br /><br />I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice:  I hate you SATAN Ice!!  Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks.<br /><br />Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with:<br />1. Wilton's<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. Homemade Marshmallow<br /><br />Fondant's I've worked with in order of yummieness:<br />1. Homemade Marshmallow<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. (distantly) Wilton's<br /><br />I would recommend the tutorial on Satin Ice website, really great:<br />[...]<br /><br />If you are only buying Satin Ice to sculpt edible animals, than this would be a great one. For first time cake coverings, try Wilton's, get things down then come back to Satin Ice.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and good luck on your cake adventures!<br />Jackie<br />domesticfits (dot)  com
3191	3	This Muesli has a generous amount of protein and would be a great wholesome meal for someone on a mass building regimen.<br /><br />On the other hand it also 17g of sugar per serving - a combination of cane sugar and fructose. This makes the cereal really sweet.<br /><br />Its unfortunate that the ingredients label is not available on the website(as of my writing this review) to let buyers know the full contents of the package.
3192	5	In November of 2011, I downloaded the LiveStrong App and began making better choices in what I eat and began to control my caloric intake.  Limiting myself to 2,000 calories per day does not leave much room for peanut butter, or rather, sitting down in the living room in front of the television with a sleeve of crackers and my beloved jar of Jiff peanut butter and a butter knife.  Those days have long been over.  However, I still have the urges and I miss peanut butter badly.  I stumbled across PB2 when I was doing some research on a machine called Yonanas, a machine that turns frozen bananas into a creamy tasty soft serve.  I noticed in the machine reviews that some people were mixing chocolate PB2 with frozen bananas in their Yonanas machine.  I had to give this a try!  I ordered a regular PB2 and a chocolate PB2.  I must say that this stuff really really does taste wonderful considering its low calorie count.  I really love PB2.  It is giving me back something I have missed dearly.  The powder is very fine, but mixes pretty well and pretty quick.  I always start with a little less water than the directions say and work up to a little more if needed.  It is absolutely delicious to someone like me that has removed traditional peanut butter from his diet.  I highly recommend this product.  It is a pricy product, but worth every cent!  No regrets.
3193	5	Coffee Bean Direct Mexican Altura Coffee is a great coffee.  I have shared with family and friends and they also enjoy this coffee.
3194	4	fast delivery, this espresso has a good flavor and is sweetend with a syrup and is pretty strong stuff will keep you up for awhile the only downfall is it is really fine ground so if you have a espresso maker it will get stuck in the filter real easy.
3195	5	Kenya, one of my favorites, is a great bold, full bodied coffee with fruity undertones.  Makes a wonderfully delicious cup of coffee.
3196	4	The Chili Lime popchips are a bit overwhelming. My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal. However, I happily ate a whole bag just by itself, and it was fun.<br /><br />The chili (spicy) comes on strong at first, then you taste the lime, then it ends with a spicy limey aftertaste that is quite pleasant. This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs. If you are on a low-carb diet, that eats up a large chunk of your daily serving, so beware! Because, like with most chips, you can't just eat one chip.
3197	5	I am very pleased with this product ..my cat loves the stuff and I love my cat...will buy more. The shipping to my home in quantity is the selling point for me..the stores run out and the cat is  needy .
3198	5	Excellent Peppermint tea - can't beat the price - would pay quite a bit more on store shelves...highly recommend the chamomile also
3199	1	I already sent a review to you- it got here in a timely fashion but it sue wasn't worth the money for the little bit you got! The cost of shipping was way too much!<br />I will NEVER order this item again
3200	4	As far as natural dog treats go, these trotter bones have a lot of meat on them.<br /><br />There's a disparity in how much meat is left on each bone though, which is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.  When you buy these in a store you can select the ones with the most meat, but online vendors just pick these treats from a bin, making you feel a bit  short-changed  by the non-meaty ones!<br /><br />One great thing about the Jones Company is that it shrink-wraps its products, thus making them hygienic and easy to store.  The shrink-wrap reduces their smell too!<br /><br />My dog loves these and they keep him busy for hours.
3201	1	To quote my husband,  It never tasted like tea.  It just tasted bad. <br /><br />I don't know what more to say than that.  My husband and kids both like the packets of peach tea mix that you can add to 20 oz bottles of water to make a tea-like drink.  I thought the MIO liquid would be a nice way to provide the same type of drink.  It wasn't.  It was horrible.  I do not recommend it at all.  Yuk.  Even when we added more, trying to make it taste less like weakly flavored water and more like tea, it just got worse and worse. Do not waste your money.
3202	1	I recently purchased 5 cases of Wellness cat food and the cans arrived at my home in their securely wrapped cases all dented up.  One of my cats is turning her nose up at this food - she pigged-out on this food when I brought it home from the local pet food store.  These cans, if they were sitting on a store shelf, would not be purchased and I feel that National Pet Pharmacy is taking advantage of online orders to get rid of canned food that would otherwise not sell.
3203	2	First off, the Amazon descriptions make it sound like you're getting 16 servings in a pack, and tho veterans know a package is only really 8 servings, newbies may not. Then they sell it as a  Pack of 2.  Does that mean you get two packages with 8 servings (1 tea plus 1 milk) each?<br /><br />Then the chai itself...It's the worst-tasting chai I've ever had, and I've had some doozies. If they're selling other Starbucks stuff, why not Tazo Chai? It's too sweet, too, but the spices are vivid enough to overcome the sweetness. The Twinings stuff is just too weak. And why can't they just leave the sweetener out of the tea part altogether? Avoid the Splenda issue completely.<br /><br />I thought that going with the Tassimo would give me stronger coffee than the Keurig makes. Didn't realize there'd only be one chai choice and it would suck. Fool me once, shame on me.
3204	2	I decided to go directly to the company to buy gummy worms. They ere almost a fourth of this price.
3205	4	Tried this to replace part of the low carb flour I'd been using.  Wanted to add some flavor and this has good flavor.  Still learning how to use this effectively but I would probably get the blanched version (nut skins removed) next time for use as a flour replacement.  Fine otherwise.
3206	5	I have always loved Tropical gels so I was happy to be able to buy them in bulk here! The caffeine helps me get moving!
3207	1	I've had Guatemalan beans before, and I loved them. However, this company's coffee tastes terrible.  Very bitter taste, and the beans themselves are extremely dry, with no oils on them like quality coffee usually has.
3208	2	Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair.
3209	3	First the good aspects, and there were a few. The casings are easy to untangle and sort, and, when smoked and cured, they are not too tough to the bite as they sometime can be. However, there are some serious drawbacks. The casings I got were riddled with holes, most of which were too small to cause much trouble. However the majority of the casings in the pack had at least one serious breech that led to a number of blown casings in the stuffing process. If you get this product (not that there are many alternatives here), make sure that you inspect the casings carefully as you rinse them out and cut out any bad spots. You will get a shorter chain of sausage links, but you will avoid the frustration of a blown casing when you are halfway through a chain and all the associated waste.
3210	5	i love this butter. it's better than regular butter and makes eggs or anything else taste great. Plus it's organic with higher levels of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA). A must in every home, i think
3211	5	I order these constantly for my dogs, and my review is always the same:  Most dogs think they are the best thing since grass, and will do all kinds of tricks to get them.
3212	5	I will not cook stir fry foods without this anymore. The Prime shipped price for one bottle is expensive, but it's worth it to get a sample to see if you like it as much as I do. Once your hooked, go for the 6 bottle cases, I wish I could get this stuff by the gallon!
3213	4	I ordered these chips by accident. I meant to order  with added salt.  I know, not a healthy choice but hey, I love salt! So, I ended up with a whole case of these unsalted chips. My wife said, hey these aren't salted! She was pleased. She worries about my diet. So, I had some chips. They're delicious! Good crunch. Very fresh corn flavor. Excellent with salsa. Sometimes a guy has to be wrong to do right!
3214	1	There was no chocolate.  There were twelve bags in the order.  There were no pieces of any kind of chocolate in any of the bags.  There were raisins, but no chocolate.  Obviously these bags were factory seconds.  For shame Amazon.  Let the customer know they're getting the product that didn't pass quality control.
3215	5	I first drank Fuji bottled water when I went on a family vacation to Walt Disney World.  We stayed in the Marriott Resort closed Disney.  Everyday they would give us a big Fiji bottle water for free.  I was amazed by the taste.  I mean it is just water but Fiji's flavor really stands out.  This a great deal on a pack of twelve.  I am a college student so I ask my Mom to buy them for me when I go home for a visit.
3216	5	We have tried several different brands of Instant Polenta, and while nothing compares to the real thing, this is the best of the bunch.
3217	3	I think this product could have been stale.  The wrappers are almost impossible to remove.  Once removed the chews seem to be OK but I think they are old.  Very disappointed considering this was almost a thirty dollar purchase.
3218	3	The MTR line of soups in the handy and easy-to-store shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The Mixed Vegetable Italian Style soup is a mild tomato and vegetable broth with a few pieces of overcooked pasta and some small chunks of potato and pieces of cabbage, beans, and peas.  Overall, nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the contents of the pouch, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I used it as a base and added leftover peas, carrots, and corn and pasta but I do think the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UURF5W >MTR Hot & Sour Clear Soup</a> is better for this purpose.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, edible starch, potato, carrot, cabbage, khol khol, beans, peas, sugar, salt, onion, macaroni, refined sunflower oil, garlic, and pepper.<br /><br />Khol khol is more universally referred to as kholrabi, a vegetable in the cabbage family that looks much like a turnip.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian and appears to be vegan but is not labelled as such.  The nutrition information is per serving at five to a packet but two or three servings would be much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup and a little over half a cup per serving is not realistic unless you serve it in a teacup.<br /><br />Calories 35<br />Calories from fat 5<br />Total fat 0.5g<br />Saturated fat 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 600mg<br />Total carbohydrate 6g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein less than 0g<br />Vitamin A 4%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 3.0g of sodium.  It even tastes a bit salty.
3219	5	Butter rum has always been my favorite Life Saver flavor. I don't know why they are so difficult to find around town, but I am glad Amazon is selling them in bulk. I ended up getting them much cheaper than I usually do, when I am lucky enough to see them for sale in an airport.
3220	5	I'm always looking for snacks that don't need to be refrigerated, and aren't sweet. These fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />They have a relatively long shelf-life, so I just keep bags stashed in my various backpacks and jacket pockets (not in the glove compartment - they will get rancid if they get too hot).<br /><br />If you don't like spicy foods, Eden also makes a plain version. (I do like spicy foods, and I wish they'd make a WASABI version).
3221	5	This popcorn is just the right amount of sweet: not so overpowering that it tastes like candy, but you can definitely tell that it's kettle corn!<br /><br />The portion size is also perfect for one person. I consider myself a relatively big eater, but by the time I'm done with one bag I'm pretty satisfied (mostly because it takes so much time to get through one).<br /><br />I also like the nutrition breakdown of this popcorn: lots of fiber (4g), a solid amount of protein (3g), and no sugar. Sure, it has ~4g of fat, but overall it's almost a perfect ratio of fat to carbs to protein, with the added benefit of the fiber and lack of sugar. What a great snack! I can't think of any other food item that is only 100 calories, tastes this good, has even a marginally good nutrient breakdown, and tides you over for an hour or more.
3222	5	I first tried the Organic Blend and decided to order the House Blend as well, a little cheaper alternative to their top seller.  WOW ! The same great aroma and consistency !<br />Thank you Weavers.
3223	5	We had spent the afternoon roasting eggplant from the farm stand on the grill to make baba ganoush and as we were ready to make it, found we were just about out of tahini.  On a late Sunday afternoon, I went on a tahini run to our local grocery stores.  The first one used to carry it, but has stopped.  I finally ended up at the W-mart grocery and found this stuff in a can.  I've never seen tahini in a can before. I bought it because we really needed tahini.<br /><br />We've tried several brands of tahini in both hummus and baba ganoush.  So far, this has been the best with the most roasted, nuttiest flavor we've found.  And I'm on Amazon to order up more.<br /><br />We did have to stir this stuff like crazy, and we even used our hand blender, on the lowest setting, to get it really incorporated.  I did have to use a fork to get a few bits up from the bottom, which were then easily incorporated by the hand blender.  Once it was opened, we did, however, move the remainder to a jar with a lid, rather than leaving it in the can for storage.<br /><br />We made one of our best batches of baba ganoush ever and I can't wait to cook up some more chick peas for a round of hummus with it.
3224	5	I had to totally remove all the wood chips and put down new weed stop the black fabric, then put 9 new bags of wood chips down and used 1 bag, my wonderful neighbor feeds @ least 10 stray cats and now we zero cat scat in my wifes garden now they just crap in the yard. So if you do all the work that needs to be done it works great!
3225	5	We went to St. Lucia on our honeymoon and stayed at Sandals resort.  The burger shack had a huge vat of this, and when I asked what it was they said it was the locally made hot sauce and warned me that it was super hot.  I tried it and instantly fell in love.  It is a mustard based hot sauce made with scotch bonnet peppers.  I have trouble finding very hot sauce that actually tastes good, and this really delivers.  I took home several bottles from St. Lucia and just recently ordered a couple off of Amazon.  As long as you like it hot and tasty, you will not be disappointed!  My favorite hot sauce and condiment bar none.
3226	3	Having tried several different dry dog foods for my puppy, this Purina Beneful food is by far the smelliest of the lot. If your dog's eating area is near the center conversational portion of your home, beware that this food will stink a bit. We place the food slightly behind a wall to conceal the sight and odor of the food, but I'm a bit disappointed that this food smells at all. Other brands of food haven't packed this much of a smelly punch. Our puppy seems to eat it OK but I wouldn't say that she's super excited about it. She has regular bowel movements with this food and these seem just the right consistency (if there is such a thing!) so apparently the food doesn't wreak havoc on her digestion.
3227	5	Loved this product.  The fact that each one holds 1 tablespoon and is easy to dispense makes it a great item to pop in my purse or workbag and take on the go.  It tastes great too.  Definately recommend this product.
3228	1	I found this product to be inedible.  Mushy, and texturally wrong.  Too large and two few tightly packed into can.  Really bad.
3229	5	If you like King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, you'll like King's Hawaiian Sweet Bread Loaf.  It's simply heavenly.  Sweet, but more substantial than the rolls, it's almost like eating cake.  When we serve it at home, I cut it into wedges like I would a pie.  The kids love it.  For breakfast, dinner, or snack, it's a real treat.
3230	5	There are no substitutes for quality fresh ingredients.  Ginger snaps are one of my favorites and these are as good as any homemade cookie recipes I have tried.  I do prefer a bit more spice than these provide but the fresh flavors more than compensate.
3231	4	Loved this sampler pack. Now I will know which ones are my favorite and I don't have to buy a whole box of something I might not like. Thanks. But I'm not happy at all with the new price increase on other packs. Will not be making another purchase because of this.
3232	5	I discovered these almond, pecan, cashew clusters about a year ago while shopping at Sam Club's. They were sampling them with yogurt. OMG ... one bite and I was hooked! I LOVE these. My kids love them. They are PERFECT by themselves or in yogurt. A serving size (~5 bite-size clusters) is 170 calories w/12g of fat (as is expected from nuts). They are very addictive ... almost like eating candy. Unfortunately, it's not hard to find yourself eating more than 1 serving. :)<br /><br />These are are 100% natural and the only other ingredients outside of the nuts are brown rice syrup, organic sugar, sea salt, and sunflower oil. I paid around $8 for a 24 oz bag at Sam's Club.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet, so I have switched to just eating raw/plain almonds, pecans, cashews and walnuts. :)
3233	4	I tried the Yogi Kava Stress Relief tea after being a user of Valerian root in my herbal tea for a while a year or so ago and having some success with that but wanting to try something different - I was finding myself in a situation where on most days I needed to get up at one consistent time but then one day of the week I needed to get up three hours earlier, thus causing a great amount of upheaval in my sleep schedule the night before and then after that early morning.<br /><br />As some earlier reviewers have noted, there is a strong, almost metallic note to this tea. I have tried Stevia as a sweetener previously and had not particularly cared for it, but that did not seem to constitute the entire  note  that I was sensing and not finding pleasing here, so some of it must be the herb itself. However, this taste is not any more displeasing than Valerian is to my palate when I compare them.<br /><br />I steep two of the teabags for approximately 7-8 minutes with the water almost a boil when I add it to the tea (the instructions said that the tea could be steeped for as long as 10 minutes). I add just a splash of cream and a generous tablespoon of clover honey to mine, and within twenty minutes I feel the effects. Some have noted that they do not feel any differently - I can say that I do, but I should mention to be fair that I am a mere five feet two inches and barely clock in at above one hundred pounds.  Still, I would say that this is to its credit - it wouldn't put me to sleep if I used one teabag for test anxiety, which I foresee using it for in the very near future. Instead of knocking you out, it simply stops your mind from racing relentlessly, or at least that has been my experience.
3234	5	Once baby figures out how to suck straight from the pouch, this is a GREAT way to get veggies in at any meal!  What a stellar idea!
3235	1	I ordered this popcorn based on the glowing reviews. It's possible that I received popcorn with an expired date but have no way of telling from the packaging. Food is not allowed to be returned to Amazon so I am stuck with over 20 bags of corn kernels that are inedible. Followed the directions exactly and popped the corn in my new popper, making sure not to over cook. Popcorn came out stale tasting with card board consistency. It was dry and just awful. My first and last time ordering this.
3236	5	I love this popcorn. A co-worker let me try some of hers, and I was instantly in love. I eat a lot of popcorn, and so far, this is my favorite microwave variety. The salt, combined with the oil cooks up nicely to give it a very savory flavor, almost like some movie theater varieties! It doesn't leave your fingers greasy or oily like a lot of other flavors. I've served this side-by-side with several other popcorns, and this is always chosen by the group as the favorite. If you're watching your sodium intake, just be mindful of how much you have per serving, but otherwise, enjoy this delicious popcorn!<br />[...]
3237	4	This is some real good coco to use.  My husband is a diabetic and I purchased this for him to try, he liked it and so did our sons.  I recommend this product to anyone wanting cocoa.
3238	4	For some reason butterscotch disks have become hard to find where I live. So I turned to the trusty Internet to satisfy my craving.<br /><br />Although these looked exactly like what I'd been searching for, their difference in manufacture is evident in their taste. They taste delicious but they're richer than the brand I grew up with. This is not a bad thing; just an unexpected one.<br /><br />Meanwhile, my local grocery now stocks the candy in the flavor I'm used to. Since this was an  old times sake  search, I won't buy these candies online again in the near future. But that's the only reason; these candies were quite tasty.
3239	5	Boy could you get in big trouble eating these cookies.  If you're a nut about dark chocolate, you've hit pay dirt.  These taste like dark chocolate brownies.  YUM!!!!!!!
3240	3	my kids love GoGo Squeez products, but the AppleBanana is not their favorite flavor.  I still buy them for them so they have variety and they do get eaten, just slower than the other flavors.
3241	5	I have three rescued cats and feed them regular food of course but when they want a treat they will only eat the Whiskas Savory Salmon. I have tried more expensive treats and pretty near every type and brand. They will only come for Whiskas Savory Salmon.  They rate it a five star treat!
3242	2	Other than for novelty purposes, I really cannot recommend this product.  There is a strong odor of smoked bacon that emanates from the popcorn, but it is has a strong artificial plastic odor to it.  The flavor of bacon really seems to be overwhelmed by a taste of smokiness.  I would think it is more accurate to say smoked popcorn than bacon popcorn. At first I thought it might just be me, but when I shared them with my friends, they took an initial handful for the novelty, and then stopped. The more I tried it, the worse it tasted to the point where the smell was just nauseating.  But I do admit that people get a kick out of receiving it as a gift.
3243	4	I've never used any Shake n Bake product so I didn't know what to expect. The instructions said to use 4 pork chops about 1 1/2  thick and to cook at 425 degrees for 15 minutes or until done.  The instructions didn't tell whether to cover the pork or leave it uncovered.  I chose to leave them uncovered for about 20 minutes and when I saw that the pork chops weren't yet done I decided to cover with a sheet of foil to keep the heat in better.  Big mistake.  10 minutes later when I checked the pork, it was cooked all the way through but the crispness that was on the pork chops before had disappeared.  They had turned soggy.  I wish I had given it longer (maybe 35 minutes) uncovered to see the results, but I'm afraid the breading might have burned at that temperature after so long.<br /><br />Despite the sogginess (in other words, juiciness, LOL) the FLAVOR was actually pretty good.  My husband and kids loved it and I thought it was  okay.   I'm sure it would have been much better if it weren't soggy.  I would be willing to give this Shake N Bake a second try.  I deduct a star for not giving better baking instructions.
3244	5	The only thing that can disappoint is that they were not individually wrapped in Aluminum foil like they use to be when I was little.  Still,  fun snack to have in the house.
3245	4	I have tried several types of arborio rice (most imported), and this one produces better risotto than most of them,  I particularly like the firmness of the finished kernel.
3246	2	I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it.
3247	5	I buy this once a year. You can not buy this in a regular grocery store. I like to make fruit smoothies thru out the year. This very healthy and delicious.
3248	3	I really wanted my kids to love it: these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious... or so it seemed. Unfortunately, none of the kids cared for it -- it tastes like stage 1 baby food (very bland) and is very runny too, so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it.
3249	5	Great taste with the flavors of soy sauce and lime. Not as greasy as other chips. My bad experience is mishandling my order. All eight 24oz bags were crushed.....two-thirds of the chips were broken into crumbs. It was either the shipping or delivery service. A  negative  five stars for mishandling my order.
3250	1	The tea had an unpleasant metallic taste and was extremely weak.  I also noticed a price on the bottom of each box of 24 for $6.03 and was charged $30.00 for two boxes.. I will not recommend. Yogi Kava is much better and more reasonably priced.
3251	5	The Murray's pecan shortbread sugar-free cookies are my favorite of sugar-free cookies.  The grocery stores that I frequent didn<br />t seem  to stock these cookies.  The product is excellent.
3252	5	My dogs absolutely love these esecially since they are soft, it is actually difficult to locate peanut butter treats that are soft that is why you should buy here. Blue dog bakery softies 10 ounce peanut butter treats.
3253	4	I prefer medium-roast coffees, so this one is too dark for me.  However, my parents, who are avid Starbucks lovers, are big fans of this coffee.  So anyone who enjoys a good dark roast coffee, this is the K-cup for you.
3254	5	I agree with the other reviewers that this matcha is a good value. I don't need the tea-ceremony-quality b/c I use this primarily in smoothies. I would buy it again. My only concern is that it is from China (I recall one reviewer suggest that Taiwan wasn't in China -it isn't on the mainland but it is part of China). I hate to say that but I am concerned about China's poor record of quality control ( not  Chinese equivalent of our FDA).
3255	5	I use Splenda any place I used to use sugar. It is made from sugar but has no calories. I have stopped drinking Pop and just buying the 20 cent unsweetened popular brand of kids drink mix. I add about 2/3 cup Splenda and it tastes great.<br /><br />It's great for baking and you use it measure for measure the same. I love it in my coffee.<br /><br />The other popular sweetener that I cannot say name has a lot of side effects for some people Me being one of them. I get no ill effects from Splenda and it leaves no unpleasant aftertaste.
3256	1	I ordered the chicken flavor and was sent the chicken and liver flavor.  I donated it to the local shelter as my dogs would not eat this flavor.
3257	5	Great rub, great service, arrived in record time. Have ordered this several times it is a favorite of ours!
3258	4	I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me.
3259	5	After about a week from when I placed my order, I was checking it's location. I didnt worry to much about it because I still had some time till it's due date. When I placed this order, I ordered something else and that came. I was happy that my one order arrived but was wondering what happened to my Seattles Best Coffee. Needless to say, I said  this will probably be the last time I order off of Amazon  but when I checked my mail box it was placed in there. I went back in and made myself a cup of coffee and my oh my, it was worth the wait. Next time I may get Level 4 though not to say 3 wasn't good but just to try.
3260	4	We use these bags to store food scraps in our freezer until trash day.  They keep up well without tears or holes or 'melting' as I have heard some compostable bags do.<br /><br />This might not apply to most other users, but for us, the only thing they are missing is a way to secure the bags - at the moment we waste a bit of space having to use the upper end of the bag to tie itself up.
3261	5	I ordered this tea in a restaurant the first time and it was so good that I asked for the name and stocked up.  It is fantastic; not bitter at all with a mild, sweet pineapple flavor in the background.  Great hot or iced. Recommendation:  each bag contains about a tablespoon of tea leaves.  If you like a stronger brew, I recommend getting the loose tea.  I travel with the tea bags and use the loose tea at home.
3262	4	I love cherry juice but it is hard to find in normal stores. I was expecting something tasting like cherry but that is not what this flavor is about. Cheery is actually the last (so least) of the juices included in the blend. To be fair, there is a hint of cherry taste but much more of an apple and grape taste.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry is very good if you are looking for a drink that is a step-down in sweetness from soda but there still is a lot of sugar in there. So if flavored seltzer is too bland, this may be a nice middle ground compared to sodas that are full of sugar.
3263	5	On vacation we ate in a Japanese restaurant and my kids loved the sticky rice.  Tried the Annie Chun's from the supermarket and it was a big hit.  Buying on subscription from Amazon is the cheapest and easiest way to get it.  We love this rice as a quick meal for one or side dish.  The size is great for one or two to share, and it's so easy.  Love it!
3264	5	These veggie chips are crisp and flavorful, even my kids love them! There is a good variety of vegetables in the bag. Our fave is the whole dried okra. These are also great for anyone with allergies because they are dairy, egg and nut free.
3265	5	These bars are really good.  Not too sweet, very chewy and full of fruits and nuts. A great pick me up in the middle of the day.  My new favorite.
3266	3	After two years on Eukanuba lamb and rice i thought i would try a different food for my choc lab just to give him a bit of variety.<br />He likes the food alot not surprisingly but the difference is after three weeks of eating it is that he is alot hungrier than he was before, his poop is alot looser, he is thirstier and his breath is not good. His coat condition and enery levels are very good though so a mixed bag for me over all. I will likely go back to the previous food with the next order.
3267	5	I wasn't sure what pumpkin spice latte would taste like, but wow am I impressed.  This is delicious.  It smells wonderful, has a great foam (as any good latte should), and has the perfect balance of spices.  It's like having autumn in a cup.  I searched several local stores for this flavor without any luck.  I'll be ordering more from Amazon then.  I also want the try the peppermint flavor now.
3268	4	Good Product...it was pretty bold to increase the price 20% at once? I hope there was a good reason.
3269	5	I don't have a very sophisticated palate when it comes to chocolate, so I might be kind of easy to impress, but I really liked the Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate Bars.  The chocolate melts nicely in the mouth and does have a hint of caramel in its flavor.  It's very rich-tasting, and delicious!
3270	5	This was my first order using Amazon's subscriber service, and I couldn't be more pleased. This saves me going on a 50 mile round trip to the nearest  big  store (I live in a rural area). And with today's gas prices, what could be more convenient?<br /><br />The shipping was free, and the package arrived at my door within days. I will (and already have) be using this service more and more.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
3271	5	I had never tried Raven's Brew, and I saw Deadman's Reach while I was in Earth Fare one day, so I thought I'd give it a shot...This stuff is fantastic! It's really smooth and dark. I'm out of it right now, but I definitely will be buying again- and I'll also be trying some other roasts of theirs. This company knows what it's doing when it comes to coffee.
3272	5	These wafers remind me of those regular chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers I was addicted to as a child...now if Glutino could only make those flavors gluten-free!  Yummy!!  Lemon flavored is a great start!
3273	4	peach flavor could be stronger. I use it in iced tea and it makes a good fresh quality of tea.
3274	4	Product (4 cans of Colombian coffee beans) arrived quickly and in good shape.  Taste varied a little between cans, but ranged from extremely good to very good.  Product was ordered as a gift, and I may order as a gift again.
3275	5	These small candies have a mild flavor and taste delightful. They are tasty enough to get again(which I will do as soon as I finish this). They are mild in flavor but just right for their size. Enjoy.
3276	1	Perhaps I got a bad batch, but this coffee was undrinkable. Undrinkable. And I am not a coffee connoisseur, opining on the finer points of the best brews. I literally mean that this was the worst coffee, hands down, I have ever tasted. It was as if I had run hot water through the used grounds of the coffee I'd been buying before this (I always buy organic/fair trade, and I like a medium-strong brew). My husband is also no coffee snob, and he knew right away that something was amiss. If I could return this I would.  I may just use the rest to fertilize my blueberry bushes.
3277	4	These are the kind of dog treats that take the dog a few minutes to chew up.  They break into safe pieces so they won't get lodged in the throat or further down, but they still take a few minutes to eat as they are kind of hard.  I thought they smelled sort of medicinal, but my dog seemed to like them a lot.
3278	5	I bought two of those to freeze food for my baby and they are great.  The food pops out pretty easily.  I wish they were a little cheaper though.
3279	5	My cat loves these bonita flakes.  Product shipped promptly and was in great condition on arrival.
3280	5	I've been so impressed with this line of pastas that it's has driven all others out of the house.  You would truly never know it's not white flour pasta.
3281	5	It seems every baby company has these pouches these days but no one has them that include SALBA, which is a super-grain that is so nutritious and good for brain development.  I know I'm not alone in having a picky toddler (2 1/2) and struggles to get fruits and esp. veggies in him.  This is a perfect way and the there is never any forcing!  He goes crazy for this flavor with the strawberry, kiwi, beet (how else would a 2 year old eat beets??) and pear.<br />I love to freeze them at night and use as a  slushy  the next day as a pool snack!
3282	2	I should preface this review by noting that I am not a Starbuck's coffee drinker since I have not found it enjoyable in the past, and also that I always drink coffee black.  So, it was with hesitation that I tried the vanilla ground coffee. I did not expect much, but I also really went into it with a hopeful attitude that this time it would taste delicious.  Unfortunately, my previous experiences held up to be true once again.  The taste was bitter and sharp, not smooth and had a yucky  fake  taste.  I will say that the vanilla flavoring tasted more natural than some flavored coffees that I have tried, but it still wasn't great.  I'm really not a coffee snob and will drink just about anything else (!), so I hate to sound so negative, but this was my opinion of the product.
3283	5	This is the only espresso bean I've bought, so I can't really compare it to other beans. But I like it. I just make regular coffee with it.<br /><br />Despite the instructions for my French Press to brew for only 4 minutes, I found that I had to brew for longer to bring out the rich sweet chocolatey taste. I let it stew for at least 8 minutes, but 15 minutes tastes good too. Brewing this bean for only 4 minutes results in a relatively diluted, tasteless coffee. I use a ceramic grinder to grind the beans immediately before brewing.<br /><br />It has a thick, mouthy texture. The beans smell strongly of smoky chocolate/truffle, almost cloyingly so. The taste is thick and sweet. I would recommend brewing for longer if possible to try and bring out more flavor.<br /><br />You get a 16 oz. (1 lb.) bag for the price, so it ended up being $20+ after shipping.
3284	5	I really am enjoying my purchase of Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha.  I look forward to my cup of mocha every morning along with a touch of peppermint mocha. If you enjoy mocha this is one sweet treat.
3285	5	My dog is over 16 and has been losing a significant amount of weight. This was the perfect food for her. I was looking for something soft that would appeal to her enough that she would eat it. She must like the taste as she eats it much better than her old dog food. I recommend it for any older dog that needs to put on a little weight and get the nourishment to keep up their energy.
3286	5	My dog loves this toy.  She can go thru a few of these in a day if we let her.  The only problem is that she figured out how to chew them off the toy in about 1 minute.  So we tend to go thru a lot of them.
3287	5	We did not receive our order.  We were informed that it was shipped and then (ONLY)a couple of days later we were informed that it could not be delivered by the shipper.
3288	3	so bad there is no nutrition label described...how much is the sodium content per cracker? thanks.<br />only 3 starts because no ingredients listed. I will review later.
3289	5	My family says these taste like regular tortilla chips.  Will definitely buy again.  Worth a try for those who have not yet done so.
3290	5	All of Krafts flavored marshmellows make EXCELLENT krispy bars. I was worried about the carmel but even those tasted amazing in a krispy bar. Chocolate, coconut, caramel and strawberry ALL of the flavors are great. I also used the mellows themselves at my daughters wedding for chocolate fountain dippers and they were a big hit!
3291	5	I LOVE THIS DRINK MIX IT TASTES PERFECT IN MY WATER AND ITS VERY FLAVORFUL. I WOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT AGAIN
3292	2	I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least  gluten-free  like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good  bite  to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.
3293	5	This stuff is great. Put it in the fridge, then smash it to bits. If you do like it softer, leave it at room temperature. This is treacle toffee and it does have that great treacle taste.
3294	5	Starbucks vanilla is a great coffee.  I'm a fan of Canada's Tim Horton's coffee but it doesn't come in flavors.  Starbucks is also an excellent full bodied coffee and the vanilla flavor is a nice change from regular coffee.
3295	2	I typically don't go for flavored coffees, but I love blueberries and decided to try this.<br />The coffee is weak and has an artificial sweetener-type aftertaste.<br />I should have stuck with normal Breakfast Blend.
3296	5	These pretzels are available at the Publix near me. They cost more than regular pretzels, but our entire family (only our daughter is gluten intolerant)prefers these pretzels over gluten pretzels. They are excellent and I highly recommend them. Crunchy, salty, yum!
3297	5	I have tried this product many times as it really, really helps relax and it helps with sleep. An FYI, it mixes really well with your favorite liqueur. I feel it mixes well with either Whiskey, like a whiskey sour, or with vodka. You need to try this! And beyond that, this Company has the best customer service I have encountered with any mail order Company. They really, really care!
3298	1	1950's Retro Candy Gift Box<br />I ordered this for my husband for Christmas 2008.  The box was torn and banged up.  There may have been $5.00 worth of candy in it and most of it was stuff I could have bought in any novelty shop-even cracker barrel. As a matter of fact, Cracker Barrel did have similar items in a basket for half the price.  I wish I had saved my money.  Then add on the shipping- it was VERY expensive!
3299	4	Very nice addition to the cupcakes I'm making. Super excited to use these. Can't find them in any stores, so I took a chance with Amazon.com. These came from Canada, so the cost and shipping was a little pricey. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with my purchase.
3300	5	I love this stuff. It tastes amazing amazing. I like to drizzle it over apple wedges and sprinkle with cinnamon. I eat this right out of the jar.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about trying it, I can say it is worth the try. If you are just getting away from peanut butter, it will not taste like peanut butter. However, like with all things, your taste will adjust. I can't get enough of it!
3301	5	These bread sticks, like every other Schar product that I have tried, are excellent.  taste is suberb (who would know that it is gluten-free?)  There is a little problem with product breakage, but not significant.
3302	5	I soon as I received the doggie chews i gave them to my dogs (2)and boy are they focus on those treats. the only down side is that they have a strong smell , but hey it for the dogs and they love it!
3303	5	I spotted these in the grocery store (a lady had five boxes in her cart).  How perfect for a thank you gift for a neighbor who has gluten intolerance!  I made up the mix and was a little concerned to see how stiff the batter was, almost the consistency of thick mud pies.  The box warned that the dough would be heavy, so I restrained my desire to add more liquid.  Putting it in the baking pan required forcibly pushing it around with the spoon to reach the sides.<br />It came out of the oven looking like brownies, but I was still worried.  When I gave them to my neighbor, he was ecstatic to have gluten-free brownies.  His dessert options had been severely curtailed.<br />Later when he returned the baking dish, he raved about the brownies and how good they were.  He froze some of them for later (and didn't share even with his wife).<br />He's going to be searching the stores looking for more Betty Crocker gluten-free dessert mixes.
3304	5	I find this noodle bowl to be the most savory and easiest way to get a quick lunch.  It only needs 3 minutes to make in the microwave and when you have only a half hour for lunch time matters.<br /><br />Try it I promise you will buy it by the case like i do.
3305	5	I purchased this coffee flavor (Hazelnut) for my wife and she is really enjoying it.  Only problem is when we received the box, all k-cups were packed inside the box and a couple of k-cup were punctured.  This is caused by the edges from the other k-cups.  We ended up with coffee grounds all inside the box. Very inconvenience.
3306	5	This oatmeal tastes great, and it has nice texture because it's steel cut. It's healthier and contains more fiber then regular mushy oatmeal. It's extremely good for you and the texture is amazing but still - it has no taste. Some people say that it has a nutty taste  but to me- it has no taste at all. However I cut a banana, and put a little sweetener and voila! - delish! I am now addicted to this oatmeal!
3307	5	I am not normally a dark chocolate lover, but these cookies are awesome. The best gluten free cookie I have tasted, and as a sweets lover I have tried quite a few.  They do melt a bit, but letting the box sit in the fridge a bit should take care of that.
3308	4	Much smaller, less plastic than original k-cup style, good flavor and for the value pricing when you use repeated mailing option. Would recommend the bold version.
3309	1	The picture on theis product makes it look like it really *is* a caramel syrup.  IT IS NOT!!  If you want something that is just caramel colored watery stuff, then go ahead and order it.. but if you are looking for an actual caramel syrup, this product is NOT for you!
3310	5	I am really in to locally grown but when it comes to olive oil, that is hard to do. (And who can do without olive oil?) This California oil is as close to Georgia as I have been able to get.  And the taste is amazing!  I also really like the Nourishing Traditions (cookbook- also on Amazon)idea of using unfiltered olive oil and this is it.  I have ordered it elsewhere but it was cheaper on Amazon. Very pleased and will order it again.
3311	5	I couldn't believe the wonderful flavor of this salt! And my doctor tells me that the trace minerals in it are actually good for me. I made a SOLE and use it every morning. Its great!
3312	5	i love the fact that i can get this delieved to my house with no delievy charge.it is so hard to find organic formular
3313	5	I grew up eating this wonderful candy, in my book there is no better. A bit pricey but well worth it. When I eat Sees Truffles my tummy giggles :-) Thanks Amazon for making this product available. You are my one stop shop these days. Fantastic candy fast delivery
3314	5	These treats are wonderful. They are healthy and you can tell they are full of EFA's. They do smell to high heaven of fish, so if you can't stand that smell, you won't like these. My dog won't eat fish, but she LOVES these. My dog does not drool, except when you open these up! These are her favorite treats, and she is a 45lb medium mutt. They are perfect for training rewards. She hates having her nails clipped, so when we clip her nails, I have my fiance pinch one of these in his fingers and she tries to get it from him and she's totally distracted from me clipping her nails. The price is right especially if you have prime!
3315	5	While I normally drink Mariage Fr&egrave;res and Peet's Tea, to save money during these hard economic times, I have begun buying this tea in the 300 tea bag package as a substitute. This tea has a pleasant taste, slightly malty and very smooth. One tea bag can make two 8 oz. cups of tea, if one doesn't mind drinking the tea steeped to a moderate darkness. Amazon is the cheapest place I found to purchase this tea; it costs twice as much at the local grocery store. While there are much better teas on the market, overall, I would definitely recommend this tea for those who are picky about their tea, but are on a limited budget.
3316	5	I was really happy with this coffee.. Tastes just like Dunkin Donuts Pumpkin coffee that they sell only in the fall each year..
3317	2	I purchased the whole beans and used my coffee roaster as usual. But it didn't matter how I roasted it, different temperatures, different times It was always bitter and with a taste of burned coffee. Ended wasting most of the coffee. I would not recommend.
3318	4	This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said  negligible. <br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product.
3319	5	This was a good deal on enough pineapple to last us for awhile!  We make pineapple shakes in the blender and also bake pineapple upside-down cakes, but tend to include the pineapple in fried rice and baked beans, too.  We go through a lot.  Convenient to buy it by the case!
3320	5	For people that enjoy a nice espresso or latte after dinner, these pods are the answer. Easy to make, no mess, great flavor and without the caffeine at nighttime.
3321	5	The recipient called crying the flowers were so beautiful. The picture she sent me looked just like the picture on Amazon.com. I will use them again!!!!
3322	5	This is great, healthy food---the only food my dogs (Cav. Spaniel and Spaniel mix) can eat w/o stomach issues. Many other premium foods are just too rich!!  The dented can issue has never required me to return the food, but it happens too often and is very annoying!  I would never feed my dogs anything else and no one here carries this particular food, so I am very thankful that Amazon sells it.
3323	3	Delicious!  Too bad you get so little for your money.  Maybe it is expensive to produce.  But, frankly, I will just use regular peanut butter from now on.<br />rs
3324	4	Some of the flavors we have tried:<br />Diet Cola<br />I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try.<br /><br />Orange<br />This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one.<br /><br />Cola<br />This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas.
3325	1	The description listed this item as an 18 count package.  There was only 1 package instead of 18 when the item arrived and I did not want to go to the trouble of having to pay for return shipping that would have cost as much as the entire refund.  Would not order from again due to inaccurate listing.
3326	5	Delicious with Tanqueray or Cuervo Gold.  Just add a little lime and you're golden.  I haven't tried it yet with vodka but I'm positive that it will be the ultimate when I get around to it.  I see no reason to try any other.  It is definitely worth the money.
3327	3	I've been on the hunt for the perfect cup of tea for the past year...Assam blend/malt flavor in particular.  Was disappointed when I tried this as it didn't provide the desired taste.  This was my second attempt at 'organic assam' tea (by different manufacturer) and the 'organic' actually seems to make it taste worse??!  I recently landed on Yorkshire Gold and I'm extremely satisfied (combination of Assam and other blends but still excellent).
3328	1	THESE POTATO FRIES ARE AS HARD AS ROCKS.I KNOW THAT THE SUPERMARKET HAS POTATO FRIES AND THEY ARE SOFT CHEWABLES. THESE POTATO FRIES ARE STALE. DO NOT BUY!!
3329	4	I have loved the taste of  Pike Place Roast coffee since its first offering. I have a special affinity to Pike Place in Seattle, and this coffee has a particular taste that brings me a sense of the place. It is robust with a flavor of  cocoa and toasted nuts. It is subtle with a smooth body. As an aside, Starbucks opened  their first store in the Pike Place Market in 1971.<br /><br />When I received my Keurig, I hoped to find Pike Place K-Cups, and that was one of my first purchases. The coffee has the exact flavor and is so delicious! It is so easy and convenient to order from Amazon. I look forward to my first cup of coffee each morning!<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-22-12<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520269926 >Everything but the Coffee: Learning about America from Starbucks</a><br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069AFIN4 >Starbucks Pike Place Roast, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 54-Count</a>
3330	5	I've been eating gluten-free for about a year, and pizza is what I've missed most.  I've tried every brand I can get my hands on - both mixes and frozen crusts - and this is, hand's down, the best GF pizza crust I've found.  It tastes great and is easy to make.  Delicious!
3331	5	Yummmm! Great price. Super tasty. I mix it half and half with oats and it lasts ages :-)<br />Great way to start the day and makes me feel healthy!
3332	5	I drink decaf when I drink coffee at night and I've settled on this as the best I've tasted. Most of the others were OK and I don't expect a decaf coffee to taste was good as a regular coffee. But, for my taste buds this works.<br /><br />BTW, Tully's Kona is my top regular coffee.
3333	5	The sampler is a great way to taste new flavors without committing to the entire box.  I found a few I love and will purchase again.
3334	5	I discovered zipfizz about a year ago working for a local gym. I LOVE IT! I have to wake up VERY early for work and zipfizz gives me that little boost i need. Not to mention the taste---it is amazing :). Pink Lemonade is my personal favorite, but they are all excellent! I stopped drinking energy drinks because of how bad they are for you and I actually began getting sick (headaches, nauseas) everytime I had one. I started drinking zipfizz and feel better than ever. It is also a good alternative to  pre-work out  supplements. Sometimes those supplements give you too much of a high that makes it hard to come down from. I now use zipfizz before working out too :)!
3335	5	We received everything in the photo plus three unexpected Lemons.<br />Everything arrived fast and fresh.<br />We are going to freeze the excess veggies for future Tom Yum Gai Soup (Hot and Sour Soup).
3336	1	Sour. So very sour. This tastes like what you find in a wannabe coffee shop (maybe more like a kiosk) that has no respect for the bean. Not sure why Lavazza would distribute this low quality roast under their famous name.
3337	4	Light to medium roast - my taste ! Best organic coffee so far . I tried many and this one makes beautiful crema  on my espresso .<br />NOt  too oily so it does not clog my machine ( like some other brands )<br />Not to strong so you can have it in the afternoon and evening without jitters.If you like very strong and dark roasted coffee - skip this one .<br />It is not the best coffee that I ever had but from all organic blends - I like this one the most  ( tried everything that I could in the range of medium an light roasts )  It does have light smell  so that is why I ma giving it 4 stars  I like stronger smelling coffee and in the category of non organic brands I like medium roasted  Illy .
3338	2	I bought a big bag of these and I don't mind the strong pepper taste. What I do mind is the bag implies these are Potato chips.<br /><br />There is absolutely no potato taste left in this snack; if you like eating extremely salty onion powder this snack is for you.<br /><br />Going by the bag I expected: REAL potatos, a little oil and baking, finally sprinkled with salt and pepper only? Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.<br /><br />If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!<br /><br />--VS
3339	5	I love drinking these any time of year but especially during the summer months for a late afternoon pick-me-up at work.  I drink hot coffee regularly but when I want something cool and creamy with coffee flavor these hit the spot and they are portable and easy to keep in the fridge at work and home.  My kids love them too but I am not prone to sharing!<br />I only buy them when they are on sale as they can be an expensive indulgence.
3340	5	I'm so glad I decided to try this tea. As a child my mother bought chamomile tea often and I tried drinking it several times throughout the years, hating it every time. THEN, I tried Numi Sweet Meadows(that's what this tea is now called) and WOW, I liked it. Actually, I loved it! It has a sweet lemony taste that keeps the chamomile from being overwhelming. It's easy to drink and is very relaxing. As far as price, which I noticed some other reviewers complaining about, I think it's worth it if you know anything about Numi. They use organic ingredients, recycled materials for packaging, and their tea bags are made from natural fibers. They're committed to being a green company and I'm willing to pay extra to support that! You get what you pay for.
3341	5	My 8 pound puppy gets a greenie every day.  She's a pretty picky eater, and usually takes forever to finish a meal (there are lots of breaks in between bites).  But her greenie is the only thing she will eat without stopping.  She loves the taste.  They also seem to be easy to eat - soft and chewy - so if your dog has sensitive teeth, this might be a good treat to consider.<br /><br />On top of that, greenies are supposed to help with your dog's dental health, which is great for me, because brushing my dog's teeth is really difficult.
3342	5	So they just came out with the Movie Butter with a special bag, where you can 'warm your corn'. As silly as that sounded, I threw the bag in the microwave for a minute...<br /><br />And was shocked. I added a tiny bit of butter, and this bag turned into movie popcorn. I swear it tasted exactly what I got in the theatres, only WAY cheaper and the butter I used had way less calories than the oil! Highly recommended, though I'm having a hard time finding more!!
3343	4	Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.
3344	5	i have used stingers honey flavor and wanted to try the strawberry flavor. i prefer the honey, but the strawberry is a great alternative flavor and it works the same. out of all the gels i have used, stingers are the best for their flavor, taste, residue (none), aftertaste (none), viscosity (smooth), and cost (same as others). my second favorite gel is the cliff bar brand. i also purchased the stinger bar and it is just like a milkyway without the candy action. for those of you whom want a gel that is smooth and easygoing and provides the perfect energy delivery, then stingers are the perfect choice.  i mountain and road bike by the way.
3345	4	Lexie is a picky little dog. She doesn't like many brands of dog food, and turns down most offers of dog biscuits, etc.  But she eats the Beneful.  And that's good -- no dog food is healthy if the dog doesn't eat it.  She does eat certain shapes/flavors of bits first, but she eats them all.  They are smallish kibbles that would probably work for just about any size dog.<br /><br />But I wasn't thrilled to see that the main ingredient is corn.  I like that this food has both animal and vegetable ingredients, but would prefer to give Lexie more animal protein and less corn. (I consider corn a grain, not a vegetable, not something that dogs are designed to eat.)<br /><br />But given the price point, overall I think this is a reasonable choice.  3 stars from me, 5 stars from the dog = 4 stars.
3346	4	great stuff. used for baking. I mix it with cinnamon then coat almonds and roast them.  a sweet delicious treat with calories only from the almonds.  use it instead of sugar in any recipe.
3347	5	My choc lab Dane just loves these treats!! He has learned when I ask him to get  treat toy  to go and find it and bring it to me. He watches me add the treat to the toy and will actually howl with excitement!! The only problem is that he has it mastered and the treats are gone within min's. But reguardless, he loves them and I will continue to give them to him! Also, the service from this seller is A++++++++++++!!!
3348	5	My cats loved these treats and I think that they really help with releasing the hairballs, I noticed some changes in their litterbox which prove to me that these treats help with hairballs issues, I am going to buy again from these treats before my cats finish them out.
3349	4	Was looking for this and one other Indian Spice, since I am from a small city I couldn't seem to find it.  Found it easily on Amazon.  The ordering process was easy and the product arrived right on time. The company it was from also sent a brochure of their other spices, will definitely order from them again!
3350	5	My two cats will eat anything. So why do I even care what they eat? I care because it's about their health and it's a important responsibility I accepted when I adopted them. This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot.
3351	5	Best one if you are looking for pure St John Wort Tea, all the other St John tea have other items in them hence you effects like high blood pressure get this instead it is better then a regular anti depressant and works right away
3352	5	Short and to the point. Ordered these three days before Christmas, they had them delivered a day before. I would suggest them to anyone. They taste amazing and there is a reason they sell out near immeadiately.
3353	5	Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.
3354	5	Sadaf Special Blend is my 'special occasion' tea, the one I break out for company or really bad days when I need something yummy and comforting.  I took one box to Haiti and made it last for three years, doling it out to myself and the odd visitor like it was gold.  So imagine my joy to return at last to the US and find this 4-pack on Amazon, deliverable straight to my door!  I already gave one box as a gift for a friend who shares my tea obsession, but I am happily enjoying a regular mug of Sadaf Special Blend.  Will definitely stock up before my next overseas move, as should all tea lovers.  It is the perfect combination of cardamom and other spices -- mixed with milk and occasionally honey, there's no beating it.
3355	5	I'm into maximizing health. I don't use any artificial sweeteners or refined sugars in any form. Xylichew was a great find because its ingredient list is actually safe. This is rare for a gum. The gum has a great taste, it has the right amount of sweetness, and the pieces are a good size. I take half a piece at a time, while my wife prefers a whole piece. If you are looking for a safe gum - this is the one. And Amazon has such a sweet deal on it - don't pass it up!
3356	1	The 1 Pound LB Madagascar Bourbon Planifolia Extract was not received vacuum sealed as shown and described. This has considerably undermined the quality of the product and its freshness. After contacting the supplier, he gave inadequate and irrelevant reasons as why the item was not vacuum sealed! I guess the supplier since he knew the item has been shipped outside the US, he did not care much about quality and customer rights and satisfaction.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about  bowel tolerance  or  happy bowels  if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.

3358	5	This popcorn is delicious!!! It was very easy to use, and everyone we had over loved it. They shipped it a few days before we were expecting, however, I thought the shipping cost was too much.
3359	5	My cat is prone to Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease, and needed a good quality canned cat food to prevent blockages. Newman's was the first I tried, and he loves all of the flavors except the Beef and Beef and Liver.<br /><br />I recently tried to switch him to Wellness, which is grain-free, and smells much better. But instead of cleaning his plate like he does with Newman's, half the can of food was left untouched. So I'm now subscribing to Newman's because I think it's a great deal for organic cat food (which Wellness is not) even if it has grains. I guess my cat just likes grains!<br /><br />I recommend this food, but keep in mind that cats are finicky (well, most cats anyway). Buy one or two trial cans before committing to a 24-pack!
3360	5	I have purchase this coffee several times my husband said it has a great taste and it is a good cup of coffee
3361	5	I ordered this to serve at a  tea  where I was speaking about roses.  It was a hit with those who were brave enough to try it.
3362	5	I have been eating pure Maple Syrup for more than 20 years and this is an excellent one that met all of my expectations. I do not think that you will be disappointed. I had it with my pancakes yesterday.
3363	4	Great item. NOW makes pretty decent products. No need to reiterate what others have said, but there are countless uses for this item. We even add it to water to drink as a pseudo-lemonade, although our primary use is for dehydrating fruit.
3364	5	Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy.
3365	2	I bought this and thought it was a good deal... WRONG!!!  The bags that I got were full of gristle and I ended up throwing it away because it was NOT enjoyable eating.
3366	1	Being a gluten sensitive individual, I was lured into a false sense of security when I read the simple ingredients on this Amazon info page.<br /><br />Because I didn't first do my homework, and read the labels before I began consuming these, I ended up having a massive asthma attack.  Just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities/allergies to avoid this product.
3367	5	I've purchased the lemon, raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all. What I like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet--perfect for my taste.
3368	4	The herbs when useing the granmder , makes them smell like there are freash. Use them all the time.
3369	5	Just got them today and they are a hit with the whole family.  An excellent snack choice for children.  I think the flavor is just right.
3370	4	I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy. However, they have a super strong odor, and I do not find them to be as appealing as he does. Recommended for dog's happiness, just hold your nose if you're sensitive to strong, funky, meat-like smells.
3371	5	After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect.
3372	1	They might be ok compared to some other pistachio but compared to everybody's nuts they are awful. I thought I'd try them cause sometimes everybody's nuts is hard to find but I won't make that mistake again.
3373	1	Special K is loaded with High fructose corn syrup.  Being on the special K diet messed up my gut for months until I was finally diagnosed with Fructose Intolerance.  HFCS is not a natural food, it is engineered with enzymes.  It makes foods in the US cheaper and sweeter.
3374	5	Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good.
3375	5	Excellent product. Your dogs will love them. I wouldn't recommend them for dogs over 25 pounds as they may pose a choking hazard for quick eaters.
3376	5	My cat couldn't keep food down and went from 10 lbs to 6 in a short period of time despite lots of vet visits and a $600 endoscopy. He seemed to be slipping away. After reading about possible food allergies and the fact that cats don't need any carbohydrates since they are obligate carnivores, I examined a lot of cat-food labels at my local super pet store, looking for an all-meat food. This is the only one I found. My cat immediately began gaining weight and has been completely healthy since he started eating it about six weeks ago. He has remained slim, active and playful. I wish more people would realize that carbohydrates aren't good for cats! And since it's canned, he gets the moisture he needs.
3377	5	All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.
3378	5	These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!
3379	5	I gave these cookies out to co-workers as a holiday gift.  They are the absolute best quality and make a nice treat.  Love that they are individually packaged so you do not have to worry about any spoiling if they are not eaten right away.  These are an inexpensive, quality gift.
3380	5	Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!
3381	5	We love this tea! This seems to be the best deal around as far as bulk and if you are drinking it everyday(or twice a day).
3382	5	Mulberry tea in a half and half blend with ocha tea is a very tasty and perhaps beneficial base with other ingredients with breakfast or lunch.
3383	4	As usual, I am very pleased with my order from start to finish.  I like the fact it's clear with no smell or taste.
3384	4	I don't think I've ever been compelled to write a review about candy before- perhaps until now. This bar is brilliant.<br /><br />I don't eat much candy. I don't really like candy.<br />I like coconut though, so what that heck, I thought maybe this will make me like candy too.<br />It is still a tad bit too sweet for my tastes (since I'm not a candy eater) but the consistency of the crunchy coconut and the smooth chocolate works really well together.<br />For those who are not big fans of coconut, you might want to steer clear. The flavor is strong and you might equate it to eating tanning lotion.
3385	5	It is perfect for a healthy chocolate fix.<br />I'd love to find a variety pack.<br />Wonderful to find it in Amazon's subscription program.
3386	5	Kettle chis are the best ever! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I'm sure this is just a personal preference.<br /><br />Crunchy, real potato chips!
3387	4	Using it as intended with a single serve pod brewer, I found it to be weak but I liked the smell so much I wanted to find another way to try it. I also have a Breville single serve coffeemaker so I decided to brew one by cutting open the pod and using my k-cup. I got a great tasting, strong cup of coffee (very strong, the kind my grandparents always used to say would  put hair on your chest ).  I just ordered grounds because I really enjoyed the strength and taste of this coffee.  The pods weren't for me, but the coffee was.
3388	2	I'm an avid K cup user - coffee, tea, cocoa - and have my favorites and not-so-favorites, but dang... This one started off tasting okay, but actually gave me indigestion (burp!). There's a disturbing metallic, cloyingly sweet aftertaste in my mouth too. Your mileage may vary, but this is one K cup flavor I won't be revisiting.
3389	4	I ENJOY THIS CANDY BECAUSE I CAN KEEP IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND THE CENTER BECOMES A LITTLE FIRMER.  IT DOES HAVE A GOOD CHOCOLATE FLAVOR BUT I DON'T LIKE MY CENTER TO BE RUNNY.<br />I PURCHASED THIS CANDY FROM AMAZON AND I AM HAPPY WITH THE DELIVERY AND THE PRODUCT.
3390	5	My grown daughter loves this spaghetti and has a hard time finding it. So, being the  Amazon Queen  that I am, I found it and she is now getting it from me on the Subscribe and Save program. Her kids love it and can fix it when ever they have a craving, it's so easy to make and they like cooking it. The order arrived fast as usual and this is a fabulous price!
3391	5	A fabulously bold blend!  I love it!  If you like a bold blend and high quality, this is it!
3392	4	If you're an 80's child you will totally appreciate this candy gift...got as a gag gift and we all enjoyed it!Only thing i suggest is repackaging it...box and filling is not very nice...
3393	1	Thought I'd try it since I order chicken korma when dining out at Indian restaurants - was quite disappointed as this jar sauce tasted nothing like anything I've ever had - tried adding butter and cream and ground pistachio, cashews and almonds and golden raisins - it only helped a little.  Will be making korma from scratch next time around!
3394	5	it's the truth.  two big a$$ tubs and it tastes just like back in the day.
3395	3	Little Debbie Honey Buns attempt to pass themselves off as a tasty snack, but unfortunately, they fail. Their size really does provide you with the perfect amount of pastry, but the taste is so bland that it doesn't really matter. Little Debbie should concentrate on making a better tasting product from a baking standpoint. As of now, these Honey Buns tastes like sugar and sugar alone. Bummer.
3396	5	I eat this with chips plain or mixing it with salsa. I perk up mac & cheese with it. Add it to scrambled eggs or even mashed potatoes. It makes a great spinach dip (googgle it) or spicy cheese on crackers. It's pretty versatile with medium spiciness and it's very good. Warehouse Deals at TEN BUCKS makes sure I always have it in my pantry and it doesn't go to waste!
3397	5	Very healthy, great nutritional value and taste great too.  When you order online you naturally have a few broken ones since this is crumbly.  I don't mind this as it's a great price and the crumbles are good to put on a salad!
3398	5	If you like Memphis style barbecue sauce this stuff is great! And to the guy who says its  bland , he must have been using something besides Rendezvous Hot Sauce, because this stuff definitly has a kick to it, and I eat hot stuff all the time. I will usually mix it 50/50 with the regular Rendezvous sauce and it still has plenty of zip. Don't just use it for barbecue, try it in place of your favorite hot sauce, its got great flavor for tacos, burritos, burgers, etc.
3399	5	These are my wife's favorite crackers. She has been unable to locate them locally, so we bought them from Amazon. As with some of the esoteric food items I've bought from Amazon, they are out of date. In this case the crackers were as crisp as they should be, so I didn't deduct a star. We got them March 20th, and the package said best if used by March 15th. We had to get 12 boxes, so I hope they stay fresh until they are gone. If not I will update this review.
3400	5	I buy Corn flakes from Amazon to make my homemade granola.  I used to use Oats, but I prefer Corn Flakes, and Rice Crisps instead, and I buy both from Amazon using Subscribe & Save.
3401	5	Light fluffy high quality rice that you can feel good about - as it is Fairtrade certified.  A trade structure designed to enable people to help themselves, and their Community, rear out of Poverty
3402	4	It arrived today. Delivery was extremely slow. The muffins seem quite good although I have eaten only one.<br />My disappointment was in the flour used. It is a very fine flour and so the muffin bites and chews more like a cake than a real muffin.
3403	5	I drink this every afternoon with two heaping teaspoons in 16 ounces of water. This does not make me either sleepy nor calm. However it is both a good way to hydrate (the stuff tastes good) and get a daily dose of magnesium so I like it and will purchase it again.<br /><br />I am writing this a month or two later and this, in fact does calm me and it also promotes a good night's sleep. I just ordered my second canister.
3404	5	Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice  dances  around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.
3405	5	My puppies love them. I and my wife love the smell. (For more details see my review of the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R8SLTU >Fruitables All Natural Pumpkin & Blueberry Flavored Dog Treats</a> :)
3406	5	I sent these to my son,  working on the midnight shift. He loves them! Thanks for such a great tasting brew! He said he drinks one a night and they are just right!
3407	5	We found these on vacation but couldn't find them we came home.  Thanks amazon for always having what I want!
3408	3	The drink had a nice flavor and wasn't too sweet. The only thing that I did not like about the drink was that it seemed to make my mouth a little dry. I kept drinking more but I was still be thirsty once I was done the drink.
3409	3	Most bagged chai blends aren't very good at all.  There, I said it.  There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on.
3410	5	I only purchase this specific treat for my dogs.  It is healthy and they love it!!!  They cannot get enough of this treat.  They will do anything I ask as long as I have one of these to give them.
3411	5	Another Stacy's product that is simply wonderful. High quality pita chips with a very nice cinnamon sugar dusting. Be careful!
3412	3	The product will crush the ice but it takes a while to do it.  I bought this so I could make snow cones for the grandchildren and I think they are going to love it especially once the weather gets hot this summer.
3413	2	Carabou Mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee I have ever had, and I've been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. It tastes just like a piece of burnt toast. The only way I can make it palatable is to put it over ice, add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk. I've got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help.
3414	5	I had a really hard time finding a somewhat affordable natural canned food for our puppy. I was having problems with him eating just his kibble so on a whim I tried a little bit of this mixed in and he LOVED IT. Ever since I've been buying in bulk on amazon..its cheapest here.
3415	4	I got the same product at my local grocery store for $9.99. Much cheaper - what's going on Amazon? You aren't even offering a bulk price. Great product, my dogs love them too, but can be found much cheaper elsewhere.
3416	5	Hazlenut is my favorite flavor in coffee and this brand delivers. Buying online is convenient and a fast way of getting what you want.  I also like the butter toffee but it can be a strong flavor.  If you're not into heavy flavors in your coffee I wouldn't recommend it but if you do, it's the flavor for you.
3417	5	Earlier this year we switched our pug to a LID food from Natural Balance (Duck and Potato formula) as he was having some issues with skin allergies and his vet felt it was worthwhile to explore the possibility of eliminating grains from his diet. His skin showed vast improvement but we still wanted to try these as he seemed as bit bored with the Duck & Potato treats.<br /><br />These treats are available in both regular size and the smaller size for small breeds. We got the small breed size, which measures roughly 1.25 inches long and is shaped like a dog bone.<br /><br />I notice the smoked hickory flavor right away. Spanky loves them. The size is perfect for his small mouth and he's able to chew them in one bite without me breaking them in half.  However, they do break in half easily, so if you're doing training with your dog and don't want to overstuff them with treats, you could break these into two pieces.<br /><br />I give him treats several times a day. On a typical day he probably gets about 6 of these, at the minimum, and sometimes a bit more. The skin on his belly (which is where he'd been having a lot of irritation) is still in good shape, so obviously he can do well with sweet potato. His stool hasn't shown any changes, either, so these treats appear to be a good fit for him.<br /><br />We continue to be pleased with the quality of food from Natural Balance. I highly recommend these treats for dogs with sensitive skin or other sensitivities to grain-based foods. 5 stars.
3418	5	In my opinion, Lindt Bittersweet is the most delicious chocolate on earth. It's perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter.  When it's fresh and at room temperature, it's smooth, velvety and completely satisfying.  No matter how many other chocolate bars I try -- and one could try new ones infinitely these days -- Lindt Bittersweet trumps them all.  Every time I come back to this bar, I feel completely satisfied.  A lot of dark chocolate hits only the back of your tongue, or has a chalky undertaste.  This one is more encompassing.  More complex, has just the hint of caramel that even good dark chocolate should provide, and yet it's never cloying.  If they ever stop making this old standby, I will be a chocolate lover without a country!
3419	5	My cats LOVE this food! It actually smells good for pet food, and it has a lot of gravy, which I read is a good thing for felines who don't drink much.<br />One of my cats had crystals in his bladder, but I didn't want to use the urinary diet food recommended by my vet so I tried this and it seems a great compromise.<br />Also, compared to other higher end cat food (wellness, newman, organix...) it's not more expensive and my cats seem to enjoy it much more.
3420	5	What with the price of food, gasoline, clothing, and most especially meat, we purchased this product to cure pork, beef, and poultry for later use. We've  never used it before, but it has been quite easy to learn how to use and experiment with. The product adds an element of food safety to home preserving and the quantity necessary for each curing is very small which will allow one package to last a very long time.
3421	5	ZICO Coconut Water is great stuff.  I wish I could find it somewhere where it wasnt soo expensvie.  It is a bit expensive!
3422	5	I drink this at once a day and I have noticed a drastic increase in my metabolism.  I love the taste of this tea....you will love it!
3423	5	Best popcorn ever!  Just like at the movies. Love how the popcorn an salt are separate so you can add or subtract to desired amount.
3424	5	these were the cheapest cups I found anywhere. They worked out to be $.40 each verses $.50 everywhere else
3425	5	The Mini Moo's is a great tasting half & half creamer, and it doesn't need any refrigeration at all. They don't spoil. We usually buy a couple boxes of these to last us for a 4 to 6 weeks and they never see the inside of a fridge and are always fine. The only downside is that they're the standard small size creamer, so most people use 2 or 3. It'd be nice if there was a larger size available, but no one seems to be making that.
3426	3	These peanuts are very, very salty. I love salt as much as anyone, but they just overdid it here. Half the salt wold have been plenty. Otherwise great, very convenient, but can't give more than 3 stars.<br /><br />(Also, for those interested in such data, each tube of peanuts contains 25g of fat, so not the sort of snack that you should graze on all day long.)
3427	5	Great for the dog's breath, they like them and they are good for the pups.  Highly recomend this product also a good training tool
3428	2	As I was transferring the flowers to a large glass jar, I found a huge clump of hair entangled in the flowers. I threw it away along with almost a cup worth of flowers. Be careful before placing an order with this company.
3429	3	I usually love Barbara's bakery goods, so ordered these. I found them too sweet and dry. They have a hint of PB flavor, but not enough to please my palate. I'll stick with the oatmeal or chocolate chip.
3430	5	My 20 year old FINICKY cat loves, no, DEMANDS these now.  I mix them in his food and he now eats just about the whole serving.  I've never seen cats (I have 3) like any treat like they love these.  The older cat needs medication a few times a day and nothing is more miserable than giving cats pills (should be an olympic event IMHO). I had discovered  Greenies  which are like little cat carmels with a hole in the middle to hide the pills that had great success with him. He really liked the Greenie caramels, HOWEVER from the moment I gave him the little crave hearts, he would no longer take the Greenies (sigh).  We've resorted to chopping the Greenies in half, embedding the pills AND A CRAVE HEART to get him to take them again!  I don't know what it is in these goodies but I wish it came in a bottle!
3431	5	Just got my 12 pack. I wasn't sure what it would taste like because I couldn't find the UNSWEETENED AND VANILLA anywhere.<br /><br />I could barely taste the Vanilla, but it was better than the Unsweetened. Unlike many unsweetened products that taste like water, this has great consistency. It is now our #1 go to milk.<br /><br />I do wish it was a little cheaper, but until they sell more of it in the retail, I won't expect that to change. Also do a subscribe and save (for every 6 months) and save another 15% or so.
3432	5	As always, the tazo tropic tea arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered.  It makes wonderful iced tea...very refreshing.
3433	5	Of the various coconut milks I've ordered in the past, this one exceeds all in taste and texture. Absolutely the best!!
3434	5	Great tomatoes.  Muir Glen has discontinued BPA plastic linings and now uses white-enamel lining, no doubt in response to public demand.  Yay!!!!
3435	5	These are really tasty! Rice Cakes are no longer the only gluten free snack. It's just so much a bonus that I can buy these bulk from Amazon.
3436	5	Best price anywhere!  If you buy this candy at the mall, you're going to pay over $10 a pound.  I got 5 pounds for $14.  Unbelievable! Shipping was free which was an added bonus.<br /><br />I've recommended you to all my friends and family.<br /><br />AR<br />Florida
3437	4	I bought these to throw in the my sons lunch box and he really enjoys them.  I bought the yellow and the red, he likes the yellow ones best.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price, you are clearly paying for the ease of this product.
3438	2	I was disappointed with this tea.  The taste was no better than Liptons Yellow Label Tea.  I expected more from a Stash loose tea since I have had good expereience with some of their tea bags.
3439	5	I absolutely love my Torani sugar free chocolate syrup!! It is the best ever!! My coffee is so amazing and I use it in tons of other stuff
3440	5	I received this item as a gift and was very excited when I got it. It looked exactly as it does in the picture and the food and snacks provided taste really good, and there is so much that I was able to share it with co-workers and still have snacks for at home.<br />I really enjoyed receiving this gift and I have received others from this company in the past and they have always been awesome. I can highly recommend this product or the company if you would like to send gifts to family or friends or maybe even just for yourself.<br /><br />Thank you
3441	1	These are NOT ODOR FREE bully sticks.  And it's not a slight smell, either.  I could smell these bully sticks before I even opened that box!!!  And when the dogs start chewing them - forget it!!! The smell gets even worse.  To make matters even worse, when I contacted the vendor, they tried to feed me some line about how the bully sticks may have a  slight  odor.  First, there is nothing slight about the odor and second, I did not pay for bully sticks that had a  slight  odor - they advertized and I paid for odor free bully sticks!!!<br /><br />I am totally unsatisfied with the product and the service.
3442	5	I have tried all of the flavors of Popchips and the Original is my favorite.  You know those chips Munchos that you get at convenience stores?  Well, these kind of remind me of them but they are: 1) tastier, 2) less salty, 3) less processed tasting and 4) better for you.  These are great snacking chips, good with dip, but definitely great on their own.  Crunchy and delicious!  If you like potato chips, you will definitely like Popchips.  Only thing that is weird is that some of the bags are saltier than others - I am not sure why.
3443	5	My husband and I have tried several brands of instant decaf, none to our liking until we found this.  Since we only drink decaf in the evenings we finally gave up wasting our money until my husband came across Mount Hagen in a grocery store.  To our surprise it made the best cup of decaf we ever had (including ground.)  It is a deep, rich smooth and satisfying cup of coffee.  Very flavorful.  If having a supply of great tasting decaf on hand is useful to you, you can't find better.
3444	3	These crispy M&M's do not taste like they used to when they were sold here in the U.S. These might be made with dark chocolate or something, but they taste completely different.
3445	5	amazing coffee, with good variety, minimal repeats, good company, good price, i'm gonna order more today!! even the lavored ones are good and i generally do not like or buy flavored coffess
3446	5	PUFFS have been a lifesaver! I keep them in my diaper bag for those occasions when my daughter needs a snack to keep her happy and me sane...like trips to the grocery store or post office. They are also a great snack to take to the park - I mix them with HappyMelts to make a baby trail mix. And they taste great! I catch myself stealing them from my toddler. I also like that they are sweetened with apple juice and not sugar! Buying organic is also important to me!
3447	5	Im big on barbeque.. so i tried this pinot noir portabella marinade... the flavor exceeded my expectations. Theres a slight undertone of wine complimented with a light burst of mushroom.<br />I highly recomend it..
3448	5	We used to get this at a local grocery for our cat, who adores it. We moved cross country and now have to mail order it because the cat went on a hunger strike when his supply from before the move ran out. We acquired 2 more cats, and all 3 adore this stuff. Two of them especially like the  soupy  texture of it, sometimes we spoon it over their kibble and cats just snarf it up.<br /><br />This isn't the primary food for cats, it is their  dessert  - served twice daily after morning and evening kibble. However, they think the stuff is the best thing ever, and prefer it to anything you can name in the way of people food.
3449	2	Although I did not go through Amazon for this company, I did order direct from them and found the service awful.  First order was lost,2nd order had a wrong item and then no response to my e-mails about the error.  Just not worth it.  The actual product was fine, service terrible.  Maybe going through Amazon would had afforded me better service.
3450	5	I have tried many different brands and types of chai, and this is definitely my all-time favorite.  Lovely with a splash of milk, or try the recipe on the box of brewing in a saucepan with milk and sugar for added flavor and creaminess.
3451	5	I have been including Deam Jacobs bread dipping seasoning in gift baskets for years.  My friends and family beg for them!  Our favorites are the parmesian and sicilian blends and we not only use them with olive oil, but on salads, pasta and as a marinade for chicken, fish etc.<br /><br />I keep well stocked and give them to friends who come to dinner when they inquire.  A great plus in the kitchen.
3452	1	When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this.
3453	5	This cereal is really tasty with generous portions of strawberry thrown into it. I am still trying to figure out whether weightloss can be achieved . However, it is quite filling and satisfies the hunger prowl.<br /><br />I have been eating it on and off for around 3 months now and have not felt overwhelmed by it. Makes for a good meal substitute.
3454	5	The only problem was, no note allowed when sending.  Those I've sent to have of course guessed it was from me.  But, if sent to someone who does not know this would be from me, it becomes a problem.<br /><br />The combination of Dark Chocolate and Acai is wonderful!<br />It's addictive!<br /><br />HOWEVER, would love for you to have a one pound bag.  This is a little large and cumbersome.  Do consider one pound bag, as well.  I would then purchase more than I do.<br />Thanks!<br />Annette A. Kaufman<br />aakaufman@erthlink.net
3455	5	This is the only food my cat will eat.  She is very picky.  Since eating this better, organic food exclusively, she has had much better health.  (She is quite an old cat.)  For some reason the  Turkey Formula  flavor is her favorite.  If I try out a different food, she runs up and down the hallway yelling, until I give her  Newman's Own  canned (turkey flavor) food again.  (I never try out new foods with her anymore.)  :)  Must be good stuff!  BTW:  I also add in fresh organic greens and green powders for her too.  She loves it!
3456	2	This Meal is terrible. The meat products, the crackers, the nuts, all of them were nasty. The least nasty was the mixed nuts. They had a weird, palatable flavor. The rest was not at all digestible.
3457	5	I like variety in my gf cereals and this granola is a nice addition to my shelf. The granola comes in packets inside the box so it is handy for travel. It's sweet but not too sweet. I eat it in a bowl with milk and it is just the right amount. Granola is more dense so a portion is smaller than a bowl full of cereal.
3458	5	I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I didn't really drink tea, until about six months ago. I was drinking <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HFA3XY >Honest Tea Half Tea & Half Lemonade 12 pack 16.9 oz. plastic bottles</a>  - I quickly grew tired of the cost, and disposing of so many plastic bottles.<br /><br />Making the switch to tea bags, I picked this tea at random from the local grocery store, expecting it would be one of many brands and types I would need to try before finding a favorite.  After trying a few others, this is definitely the one!<br /><br />If anyone has information on the quality of ingredients, EGCG levels, etc., please reply to this review.
3459	5	This is a excellent barbecue sauce.  We eat at Famous Dave's Restraurant and we alway request this sauce. We also use this at home when we barbecue.
3460	5	This is both a blessing and a curse.  The blessing part is these pill pockets are pretty much perfect.  They take a pill very nicely, cover it, and make it wonderfully desirable for the dog to eat the pills.   Serve with food because it's so bitter your dog will hate you forever  is not a match for these little suckers.  Little dog loves these, and would happily snarf down the entire packet if she could.  As for the curse... well, you can no longer safely move pill containers anywhere.  With a keen ear and a taste for beef pill pockets, your dog will hear you shift your containers even one nanometer and come running, expecting you to give it a treat.  My Dad has to take pills twice daily... you can see why this is an issue.<br /><br />Sealed air tight for freshness.  Approximately 30 to a bag.  Suitable for small pills.  Tasty, yet functional.  A fantastic delivery system for an otherwise annoying problem.  5 stars.
3461	2	The five star system doesn't work well when the product is excellent but the packaging is terrible. I give the order two stars because several bottles were not sealed and leaked all over the box and the other bottles.  This company needs to totally rethink the sealing method it uses so that the product arrives clean and dry. It was a real mess and I had to spend a lot of time dealing with cleaning it up.  In addition to the mess, I have chosen to refrigerate the unsealed bottles to avoid possible spoilage.  This takes up valuable space in the fridge for something I had planned on simply shelving in the pantry.  Had the order arrived as I expected, I would give this product five stars.
3462	5	Bought this for our mother battling Cancer. Was advised by close family friend stating it will help her detox her body of all the un-needed toxins throughout her body, and thus, giving her treatment higher effects! Excited for the outcome.....She is Blessed :)
3463	3	the coffee was well packaged, and arrived quickly.<br />however, the flavor was  off .<br />i ordered southern pecan.<br />the taste was distinctly hazelnut.<br />not a good thing.<br />we're using it, regardless.  cutting the flavor with 2 parts breakfast blend to 1 part 'souther pecan'.<br />quality was fine.  somewhere along the line, however, i  think these bags were mislabeled.
3464	5	I have been in search of a healthy alternative for animal crackers. This product is the bomb!! they are so flavorful, and a perfect consistancy. Highly reccomend!
3465	1	Even my 8 year old, who was super excited to eat bugs agrees.  These taste terrible, just disgusting.  Not even worth it for a kid who's happy to be eating bugs.
3466	1	I have numerous food allergies and got these as a healthy  on the go  snack. Unfortunately, I think the only way I would be able to enjoy them is cooked or baked in something since I don't like their taste  au natural.  They are also extremely small and kind of hard to eat because when you put some in your hand, they roll all over the place!
3467	5	Instant Breakfast is great for mornings when I'm in  rush and need something. I like to blend it with my whey protein as a complete meal substitute and the lower amount of sugar is very much appreciated
3468	5	Chocolate that is actually good for you - you can't beat that.  The flavor is great.  I use it in smoothies and deserts.  It is great anytime I'm craving chocolate.
3469	5	This Mars Bar candy for America was delivered right and it is a lot better than snickers with almonds.  The almonds are in the nougat with the caramel separated for the right taste.  India Food stores in U.S. sometimes cary a Mars with almonds, but the caramel is a little rich in taste so it is close but not quite the same.  The Mars company and Walmart needs to bring this candy back to U.S. stores.
3470	5	I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog.
3471	5	this cheese, made primarily from sunflower seeds and macadamia nuts, is absolutely delish! sprinkle it on your salad with a little lemon juice and a drizzle of your favorite oil and you're all set! you can also eat it straight out of the bag like I did when I first tasted it. when you do, forget about the calories! my only complaint again is the price--everything raw (and generally organic) is sooooooooooo expensive. anyway, if you're looking for a splurge, you won't be disappointed with this one. Bon apetit!
3472	3	I can't think of a product that Newman's Own makes that I don't like.  This is probably the closest.  Perhaps a more refined palate of a coffee connoisseur would disagree, but I find this coffee to be disappointing.  To be sure, it is  extra bold , but I also think it tastes extremely earthy.<br /><br />I can't recommend it, but if you like bold, strong blends, it might be more to your liking.
3473	1	I am on the Medifast diet, so was looking for a few low carb/low calorie options to add to my daily diet.  When I heard about Walden Farms calorie free peanut butter I was highly skeptical but decided to give it a try.  I have to say, that this product was probably THE worst tasting diet food I have ever eaten.  I am a huge fan of peanut butter, and thought maybe this would slightly resemble it, but the taste was nowhere close.  This product SERIOUSLY offended me.  I would give it to a homeless person, but I'm not that cruel.  If you're looking for peanut butter substitutes I'd recommend PB2.  It contains only peanuts and salt, and actually tastes like peanuts.<br /><br />Walden Farms DOES have good products, though.  I will say that their caramel dip is very good, but I wonder why they are still able to make enough money from this  peanut butter  to keep producing it!
3474	5	Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the  green pearl  of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself  home of silk and tea  for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name  gunpowder  derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.
3475	5	I've tried several varieties of coffees for my Keurig Coffee maker and the<br />Green Mountain Nantucket Blend has emerged as my Number 1 favorite for my<br />first cup of coffee in the morning and an occasional  pick me up  cup in<br />the afternoons.  Not too strong, not too weak--a nice, medium blend with a<br />wonderful aroma.  Buying it in the 50 count size gives me a better  per cup  price<br />and allows me to order less often.
3476	5	i have been eating this since i was in grade school, they are still my favorite cereal ever! sweet and crunchy, yummy!
3477	1	This jerky is inedible.  You would have to reconstitute it in beef broth to be able to chew it.  Additionally, all you can taste is the hickory smoke and salt.  It might be leather for all I know.  I purchased several other varieties from this manufacturer, and they are all of similar poor quality.  Avoid.
3478	4	My daughter bought a green one of these from a candy store this summer.  She never got past the ears.  She wished there had been a red one because she was SURE she would like it better.  So, I decided to get her one for Christmas.  After reading the reviews, I was a little reluctant to spend $10 on something I thought would end up in the trash.  However, it was a big hit!  Does it taste like the small, high quality gummy bears? No, but, it did have a good texture and a decent taste.
3479	5	I have been drinking this Chamomile tea for the past year late at night when i need a relaxing caffeine-free tea.<br /><br />This or Twinings are both excellent.
3480	5	Our family has 4 dogs and a cat :) The most fragile is our wolfie dog (siberian husky). Ever since we switched his food he has more umph in his prance! I think all the omegas and coconut oil really help his aging joints.  We went from a dog we thought we were going to have to put down a year and a half ago to a happy husky. Also, his poops are firm, moist and consistent now (sign of good health).
3481	5	This is a nice new twist on Chips Ahoy cookies. These cookies are a much, much softer version of regular chocolate chip cookies, to the point where the packaging has a big  gooey  label on it. After having a few, I can definitely agree that these are exceptionally soft cookies, much softer than the regular  soft  Chips Ahoy cookies. However, it seems like a lot of the other reviewers have complained that these cookies aren't  gooey  enough. I definitely don't agree. For a mass-produced, mass-marketed Nabisco product shipped to thousands of stores, I imagine this is about as gooey as you can make a cookies and still have it last to market. It's not quite  melting in your mouth,  but it's not too far from that either. The flavor is also much richer than regular Chips Ahoy cookies. These have fudge in them, so there a much richer chocolate taste. Overall, if you like chocolate Chips Ahoy cookies, I suspect you'll love these. If you are picky about how  gooey  your cookie is, then store-bought just aren't ever going to be the same as homemade cookies in that respect.
3482	4	I originally bought this for a relative who was visiting me and who only drank natural cocoa powder mixed in water. I tried it and loved it. I never could drink natural cocoa powder before this as I found the taste too bitter but this was different. In addition to making cocoa drinks, I've used it in making muffins and they came out great. I would have given this 5 stars but took off a star because the price has literally doubled since the last time I bought. As much as I like it, I feel it is now overpriced and will have to find a cheaper option. I am disappointed since it was unavailable on Amazon for a period of time and I even signed up to be notified when it became available on Amazon again.
3483	5	We love this seasoning salt and cannot believe it is not in every store in America.  We have relatives that live overseas and they love it as well.
3484	4	The product was shipped to me quickly. And yes it did arrive in a solid form but after doing a little research, I knew this was normal and I am pretty used to heating it up in a bowl of warm water before using. My hair is in a transition from relaxed to natural state so I use this product to  seal  moisture in my hair every couple of days. Honestly because of the point I am at with my transition, I can't really say if the product is helping me but I know it hasn't definitely not done any harm to my hair!!! I didn't give the product 5 stars because while the product says 100% pure coconut oil there isn't an ingredient list for me to be sure. And I don't like the smell but it is not a bad smell, just not to my liking. I would say this is a good buy even if it does not work on your hair...it will probably be a nice moisturizer for your skin.
3485	5	Love these...great dark chocolate taste, great caramel filling... no artificial taste to it.  Have to avoid buying because they're irresistible if they're in the house!  :)
3486	5	I love this tea - light and refreshing - soothing and energizing. Whenever I have a cup of Constant Comment, it seems it is just what I needed right at that moment. It doesn't compete with anything I'm munching on, but I usually just have the tea by itself.<br /><br />Ahhh... think I'll brew a cup now!
3487	5	I got this for my friend's cat and the cat loved it!!! Before we even opened the package she was sniffing it like crazy! I recommend this to anyone who has a cat. Hands down best cat nip I have ever bought!
3488	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ >Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug, Medium/Large</a>This is the best 10.00 i've spent in a while. I fill it with my 85# puppy's noon kibble and he has to work to get it out. He grabs the rope and smashes it very hard on the concrete. He will play with this thing for hours. I cannot believe he hasn't broke it. I would recommend this for all dog owners.
3489	5	And if Mother loves it then you know it's good.  She's commented on it multiple times and I'm sending another order.
3490	5	My dogs love this stuff.  You feed less food thus picking up less poop.  Kinda expensive but the dogs have plenty of energy.
3491	4	having one with or after lunch totally eliminates the urge to find a quiet niche and cut a few zzzzz's.  i have a large capacity for caffeine so rockstar does not make me jumpy at all...just eliminates the drowsys.  the flavor may be an acquired taste but could be worse.  a small price to pay for the buzz.
3492	5	My husband became allergic to gluten a few years ago, and it has been difficult to understand how to re formulate the diet so it tastes good and is GF.  The (frozen) rice bread is just aweful and tastes like cardboard.  I started looking around at bread mixes to use with my bread maker, and Pamele's is the best out there. I was happy to find the larger bread mix bag, as it is much more economical.  Anyone that has had to follow a GF diet can relate to the confusion, need to read every label in detail, and higher cost !! as most of the GF items are in the specialty / organic area.
3493	4	Mostly we eat tuna in salad or heated in casserole type dishes, so the flavor is not as critical to us as it would be to some people who eat their tuna almost plain from the can.  However, when combined with chopped sweet onion, celery, olive oil and fresh lemon juice, this tuna is very tasty.<br /><br />I am willing to pay extra for this tuna mostly because of the BPA free can although the quality doesn't seem to me to be higher than other premium  health  brands such as Natural Sea. I have also purchased the Wild Planet brand of albacore tuna and personally prefer the taste and texture of this skipjack tuna - even though it is, as others have mentioned, quite salty tasting.
3494	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQ2DL4 >Natural Vitality - Natural Calm, oz, 16 oz powder</a>  FAST DELIVERY.  EXCELLENT!
3495	4	this product is tasty. You add a half lb of ground beef, 2 cups milk, and some water. It is very much like Hamburger Helper but with less processed ingredients and whole wheat pasta mix. It takes a few minutes to thicken after cooking, the sauce is thin before it sits. Overall, I like the smaller packaging and that it uses ingredients that I can read and understand.
3496	5	We used Woody's for many years before the original manufacturer closed and were sadly disappointed when they closed. Meatloaf and grilled meats were never the same without it. Woody's is as much a staple in our kitchen as flour and sugar. Unfortunately, no grocer in our area carries it, but it is well worth the effort to order online.
3497	5	Fast shipping! I received the bonsai in great condition. It is very easy to take care of. I would definitely recommend to a beginner. BonsaiBoy will have more of my business :-)
3498	2	I am sorry I bought a dozen. The product tastes good the first time but then it becomes boring the second time. And by the third preparation the smell all over the house becomes objectional. I was hoping we would eat a box a week, but the onion taste and smell is so strong it stinks up our whole house for the day when we prepare the item.<br />I bought on a subscription order basis but cancelled because of the overly strong seasoning.<br />I also bought the Skillet Fries and am really sorry I did. They have the same seasoning and just as strong. I fixed half a box and after re-hydrating tried to rinse off a lot of the season but it didn't work.<br />It will take a year or more for us to get rid of these. Probably give some to the postal workers homeless food collection at Thanksgiving.<br />I wrote the company regarding reducing the seasoning but have had no response as yet.
3499	4	These were a nice surprise.. Very crunchy, and with a definite corn flavor even thought there are all those other great grains i.e.  brown rice flour, flax seeds,sunflower seeds, and quinoa.<br /> I nice healthy snack that you don't' have to  feel guilty about eating or sharing with you child.<br />  If you give this to them they will never guess it really is GOOD FOR THEM.. I love that.<br />  What we did with some of them is use them as a cracker with a healthy hummus dip. Great on Movie Night.<br />  Will definitely look for these again.
3500	5	I'm a much happier person since Two Leaves came on the scene. At last, good, affordable tea that isn't what's left over after making tea. The flavor is true and full without an overdose of perfume. The bags are a wonder to behold. And I do: It's especially nice watching Two Leaves jasmine steep, flowers unfolding. I haven't had jasmine this good since the tea garden in Golden Gate Park. I think that was 1969.... Treat yourself.
3501	4	My baby has arguably enjoyed this milk more than any other milk he's been given in his short life so far. I have tasted the milk and seen why he enjoys it so much; it's very creamy.<br /><br />The milk however arrived with a rather short shelf life, less than six months to the expiry date. May be it was the available stock as at the time I orderd but this was the only downside; otherwise, great milk.
3502	5	I am a big tea drinker and this is by far the best green tea!  The taste is pleasant and fruity and it doesnt taste bitter like other green teas...it is great with honey but not needed at all...  I think it helps keep me going throughout the day...i am a stay at home mom and need a extra boost in the afternoon!  Works perfectly and doesnt make me jittery at all!  Highly recommend it if you want to try out green tea but unsure of getting straight up green...due to the bitterness...this is a nice mix of flavors!
3503	4	This is light, tasty, healthy snack. I loved it and it really helped with curving my hunger. I love the texture, aroma, and taste. Thanks!
3504	5	These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.
3505	5	Except for baking, Morton Coarse Kosher Salt is what I use in the kitchen and at the table. I prefer pure, plain salt to the somewhat muddled flavor of sea salt. Table salt is much finer so it is harder to pinch and distribute evenly on a finished dish.<br /><br />This coarse, flaked salt is also necessary for topping pretzels and margaritas and making pickles. It is also especially nice topping whole grain loaves and on meat, poultry or baked potatoes. If you have a French recipe calling for  gros sel  something of this nature is what is intended. A nice gift that is easy to make using this salt is pickled lemons, which are very useful in Mediterranean dishes.<br /><br />Note that this salt is less dense than regular table salt. The label indicates to add 1 tablespoon per quarter cup if the recipe calls for table salt.
3506	5	flackers taste great!  texture very satisfying...great with guacamole, humis!  yea!  finally a cracker that's great protein with little carb...carbs like in vegies!  not as in bread!  love them!
3507	5	I love walnuts and tried these at a friend's house.  I was hooked.  But, I had also heard that walnuts are good for cholesterol issues.  I have always struggled with keeping my LDL (bad) cholesterol down while keeping my good (HDL) cholesterol up.  I eat a healthy diet, I exercise, and do everything I can, but after adding these walnuts to my diet (I eat a handful a day), the results have been incredible! For the first time in my life, my cholesterol is so great that my doctor doesn't try to get me to take medicine for it anymore. (I always refused to take it).  My LDL is way down and my HDL is so high it's off the charts (108)!  The best thing is that the nuts taste wonderful and are a great afternoon snack!!!
3508	2	This coffee is extremely weak, even when brewed using the eight ounce setting.  The lack of decent coffee choices with CBTL has caused me to rethink my recent purchase of the CBTL Briosa.  The capsules are pretty expensive for an eight ounce cup of coffee that is nothing special.<br /><br />The Briosa is being returned to Amazon tomorrow due to the fact that it arrived missing a part that caused water to spray all over my top cabinets and an electrical outlet.  The Briosa is also extremely loud and I had to put a towel under it to keep it from vibrating across the counter top.  Amazon was extremely helpful with arranging the exchange of the Briosa.<br /><br />The Briosa currently has no reviews, negative or otherwise.  Will post a review on the Briosa after I receive and test the replacement.
3509	5	Ocean Spray is the best cranberry sauce I've tried.  It has just the right amount of sweetness yet still keeps the cranberry flavor.<br /><br />Not only is the product good, but the packaging that this comes in is very convenient.  It comes in 2 large plastic containers with a resealable top.  You don't have to struggle with opening a can and the sauce can still stay fresh.<br />The price of this also seems to have more bang for the buck.<br /><br />If you love cranberry sauce and wish to buy in bulk, this is the product for you.
3510	5	These beans arrived fast. They were moist, fresh and smell great! I purchased 5 shot sized bottles of bourbon and put one bean in each. They are going to be great Christmas gifts for the bakers in my life. I will order these again soon for actual baking.
3511	5	ALL I DO IS SHAKE THIS CONTAINER AND MY DOG COMES RUNNING. SHE HAS HAD FOR OVER A YEAR AND PREFERS TO ALL TREATS AND FOOD. I FEEL GREAT AS THEY ARE GOOD FOR HER. THE PRICE SEEMS HEFTY BUT YOU CAN CUT THE PIECES UP EVEN THOUGH FREEZE DRIED. OUR FAV DOG TREAT FOR SURE. MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT TO GIVE YOUR PUP A EXCELLENT SOURCE OF ALL NUTRIENTS THEY LOVE. I FEEL LIKE I'M TRICKING HER.
3512	4	Like others I ordered this on a lightning deal and it's great value.<br />I gave four stars for flavor and freshness, it IS some of the best jerky I've tasted.<br />I was a little disappointed however, the first bag and first few pieces were moist, soft and really good, then the next couple of pieces were like rawhide, with some obvious jerked gristle, which took some serious chewing, and detracted from the quality of the rest in the bag.<br />I thought this was a one off, but the second and third bag have been the same, mostly soft and satisfying, but about 25% smokey boot leather.<br />I don't know whether it's quality control, but it seems like  pot luck  with what's in the bag.<br />All that said, I haven't had the jaw ache I get from the popular brands so it's still good..........just not perfect.
3513	4	This product was advertised by Amazon with the word,  Equal  and has a photo of Equal packets, but although it has the same ingredients as Equal and was distributed by the same company that makes Equal, it does not say,  Equal  anywhere on the product.  I've done several taste-tests and it apparently tastes the same as Equal, but the listing on Amazon should have said that it isn't Equal.  That's why I didn't give it five stars.
3514	3	I didn't read the listing carefully enough and thought I was ordering K-cups.  I wasn't able to return them, so I gave them to my sister.  I used a couple of them and they just didn't do it for me.
3515	5	I was using Dove's Moisturizing Shampoo/Conditioner. It did a good job with having soft hair, but I was having snow storms of dandruff and lots of hair breakage to a point I pick off ten plus hairs off my when I got out of the shower and throughout the day. Also, with the dandruff, after the owner of my workplace (who can be very picky on appearance, down to one flake of dandruff) walked in and seeing the amount of dandruff on my black uniform, I said  That's it! <br /><br />I walked into Walmart and looked at the dry scalp/dandruff shampoos. Head and Shoulders somewhat did the job, but my hair gets dry and brittle and did an okay job on the dandruff. I then stumbled upon Clear. I figured I'd give it a shot, even though it was a little pricey for me (The only downfall of this product, but better than getting $25 salon stuff). I got the Shea Cleanse and Nourish so that not only did my scalp feel happy, so did my hair. Good news, I needed shampoo and conditioner anyway. I ran out of the Dove anyway.<br /><br />Went home and used it that night. The results were immediate on the spot. 75% of the flakes were gone, my scalp showed major improvements, and my hair was shiny, smooth, and soft (even though I use the Suave Keratin Serum as well, this made it go from bleh to SWEET ZOMBIE JESUS THAT'S GOOD!). The nice scent of shea was relaxing and nice, and it lasted too. I walked into work the next day (I wash my hair every other day) and a co-worker grabbed me and said  Why do you smell sooooooo good?! I want that!  So, told her it was my new shampoo/conditioner.<br /><br />And as for my black work uniform, I have not had to brush off flakes or pluck ten plus hairs off me!<br /><br />My hair has never felt better. I wash it every other day, and focus on the scalp a wee bit more so that I know it's doing its job. I only use a hair straightener (with a heat protection spray) on the lowest heat setting and my hair still feels and smells amazing. A male friend of mine also has the exact same problem as me and he will be getting some today to help him out (I told him they had a mens line he can look into).<br /><br />Get it! Trust me, you won't be sorry. You want a happy scalp and hair at the same time, get this. I'm not regretting it now. :)
3516	5	I love this oatmeal and believe me, I have tried them all.  It's super easy to make in the microwave and had a great, nutty taste.  I had a bit of honey and cinnamon to mine for flavor.  I recently purchased this for $1.50 for a box of 5 pouches.
3517	5	My kitties love their food in chunks, jawing wholeheartedly while tilting their heads from side to side as they really get into the chewiness of the chunks.  So, good exercise for a start off!!  There is plenty of gravy to lubricate the morsels, and they lap that up straight away before digging into the big bits. To see them enjoy not only the taste but also the process makes it well worth the money.  Highly recommend this but only if your kitty really loves chunky food!
3518	5	These bars are amazing. The Mexican is my favorite but I love them all. They're great for a busy schedule. I keep one in my purse, it keeps me from stopping by the vending machine and grabbing something that will leave me hungry in an hour. These bars satify me for several hours.
3519	1	I'd label this as flavored water, but bottled water has more flavor. I noticed when I poured it into a sauce pan for heating it up, almost half, maybe more, was just water. Upon actually eating it, I couldn't help but notice what little bit of flavor there was tasted like regular olive oil (as opposed to the  Extra Virgin olive oil listed in the ingredients). I'd like to think it was a bad batch, but even then you'd think quality control was better than that. Either way, I'd recommend buying a single container locally and trying that before buying a bulk quantity.
3520	1	It took forever to get my cookies, and I paid for express shipping and got my product 3 weeks later, I will never order from that company again.
3521	4	I ordered these chips by accident. I meant to order  with added salt.  I know, not a healthy choice but hey, I love salt! So, I ended up with a whole case of these unsalted chips. My wife said, hey these aren't salted! She was pleased. She worries about my diet. So, I had some chips. They're delicious! Good crunch. Very fresh corn flavor. Excellent with salsa. Sometimes a guy has to be wrong to do right!
3522	1	Terrible & expensive for what you get. Tiny little kernels, lots of hulls. Stick with the cheap store bought.<br />Bleh what a rip off.
3523	1	The only good thing I can say about the Lemon Gluten Free cookies is that they really do have a good lemon flavor! The texture was like sand. In fact it was very much like a slab of wet sand with a good lemon flavor. Sorry to say, but I spent lots of money on this and am now stuck with what I consider inedible products.
3524	4	Light, floral, honey, vanilla, nutty, graceful single malt. I can drink this stuff for breakfast. Put a bottle in the freezer for a fabulous high viscosity treat after dinner. One of those whiskies you should always have on hand.
3525	4	These snacks are perfect for the on the go exercise enthusiast.  They don't taste too sugary and are a great pick me up for when I need to replenish on the food front.  For the price I paid, I'm very satisfied.
3526	5	I first tried these after my sister gave me a bag of the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YT5NFO >Snack Factory Original Pretzel Crisps</a>.  My family really liked them as a quick snack they could grab a handful of.  I also found them dipping them in sour cream, peanut butter, cream cheese and also adding sliced cheese.  When I saw they had flavored ones, I had to buy them and so far the <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YTC9MO >Snack Factory Buffalo Wing Pretzel Crisps</a> are our favorites. They don't work well dipped in peanut butter, but are good with all the others including ranch dressing or just by themselves.  Although the size of the bags seem small, because they are so light and crispy, you do receive quite a bit in them. On average I've paid anywhere from $2.50 to $3.50 a bag and I'm okay with that. Definitely give them a try if you like Buffalo Wings!
3527	1	this is the worst.  i was looking for a way to make a pumpkin spice latte at home, without all the carbs.  this syrup is awful.  it smells nothing like pumpkin - at all.  and tastes like cough medicine.  i couldn't recommend this product if i wanted to.  i took a chance on it because i couldn't find it locally.  you win some.  you lose some.  i lost.<br /><br />i will say, however, that the vendor was wonderful.  it was safely packaged and shipped quickly.<br /><br />if anyone has any recommendations as to how to use this product, please feel free to leave a comment on this review.  i would love to be able to use it.  unfortunately, between the smell and the taste, i see no way to do so.
3528	5	My husband and I are crazy about Coffee People k-cups.  A friend gave us a box of the  Donut Shop  cups and they are spectacular.  Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch.  Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator.  A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.
3529	4	These are hard treats shaped like hearts that you can break in half if necessary. They have decent ingredients though I try not to give my dogs anything with grain, the oatmeal and barley flour is not too bad. I only give one a day as a late night snack. My Doberman likes them but she is not too picky. My picky Shar-pei will eat them but is not enthusiastic about them (he prefers Merrick sausages). Overall, these are a decent snack for dogs as long as your pet does not have dental issues, these should be okay for them.  I want to make a comment about the packaging. This is one of the few  zip-loc  type resealable bags that actually reseals without having to mess with it a bunch of times. It stays nice and tight and keeps the treats fresh.
3530	5	Love this product!  It adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners.  Hope this product is here to stay!
3531	3	My son (9 months) seemed to enjoy these meals.  With the exception of the risotto dish though, I found them to be quite runny.  It was more difficult to feed him without making a mess.  The risotto though had a nice consistency.  The flavor combinations sounded good to me but I have to admit I don't usually taste them myself.
3532	1	Price at Amazon entirely too expensive. Plus some of the canned dog food was hard, stale & my elk hound refused to eat it.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy again & I CANNOT recommend it to anyone.
3533	4	Understand: this same brand sells crispy red onions in bags that are essentially French fried onions like in a can, only crisper and more flavorful.  (The type of onions one puts on green bean casserole).  Crispy red peppers are the same thing, only made from peppers instead of onions.  So the pepper is not the star here, only about 50% of the product.  For what they are supposed to be, they are quite good.  Do not buy them expecting a lot of pepper--they are half breading.  They are crisp, not greasy, and are tasty as a snack or a topping for other foods.  I add them to camping food and travel food for variety.
3534	1	1 tablespoon of this product + 2 tablespoons of water = 1 egg.<br /><br />There's eight powdered ounces.<br /><br />That's 16 eggs.<br /><br />$12+ for 16 eggs...a dozen eggs are $2.50 at my local Safeway.<br /><br />Put it another way:  when you buy these, you are paying roughly 75 cents for each egg.<br /><br />If I were you, I'd find another way to buy powdered eggs than via Amazon.  The price is just outrageous.
3535	5	This is the best chocolate bar I've ever tried.  The salty taste is in perfect balance with the chocolate.  I'm not the only one that thinks so, since our local grocery store sells out of this particular bar almost as soon as they arrive.  The other Chocolove bars are fine, but this one is tops.
3536	5	I purchased the blood orange, lime and lemon oils. The lemon is delicious as are the other two. They are a great addition to your cooking tools.
3537	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KBFKIQ >Greenies Dental Chews - 27 ounce Box - Petite - 45 count</a> Very good product delivered promptly at a fair price. Will order more from this site.
3538	4	I bought this sushi making package with a lot of hesitation. How could this really be good?  I am happy to report that I still don't know how but that it is really good.<br /><br />This package contains a bowl of sushi rice (for microwave use only) that's ready in 1 minute.  The rice tastes good straight out of the bowl and there is plenty of it so no need to skimp. You need to provide any additional filling and the wrappers stick to themselves easily.  They also include a packet of seasoned soy sauce.  No other condiments were provided.  A bonus is that it does not need refrigeration and is great in a clutch for a light meal.<br /><br />Although it is not a complete package (excludes fillings), adding your own food to the sushi rolls is what makes this kit a true gem.  My picky kids can add anything they like to make their own personalized sushi rolls.  They also love helping!  It's a great way to sneak in some veggies (cucumbers & carrots) too.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this sushi roll kit was the length of the wrappers; they are a little too big to be bite size, especially for the younger crowd.  It's minor compared to the rest but it's good to know exactly what you are getting before buying.
3539	5	i have tried so many differnt coffees and this one is my favorite<br />it has a bold taste so if you like bold you will like this one .<br />it is your perfect cup of coffee for your wake up.and for the second cup if you want you can reuse the cup and have a milder cup.<br />  linda orchard park ny
3540	4	2 out of 3 of out cats love them. As far as finicky cats go, I consider that a success. They've only been enjoying them for a few days, but so far they haven't caused any vomiting as many of the other treats tend to do.
3541	4	I purchased this Easter Basket online for my niece. She loved the soft bunny and basket of sweets. I recommend this child basket arrangement to anyone that want to make a great impression to family and friends.
3542	4	This is a breakfast blend coffee and, for many coffee producers, a breakfast blend also means  the strongest daggone brew we can make  mentality.  Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!
3543	1	I buy most everything from Amazon BUT not coffee K cups.[...] has this product and all K cups for $13.99 per 24 and free shipping and they ship air UPS.
3544	3	My cat completely ignores this flavor. Instead of the normal slab of meat, like BFF's other flavors, this one is soupy, and apparently not very good. My cat looks at me like I'm crazy when I give it to her. I don't know if I got a bad batch. If someone has gotten this, and it wasn't soupy, please leave a comment.
3545	1	I have purchased these in the past, but this order tasted a little stale. I have purchased food many times, but this was the first time that I have been disappointed in the quality. I should have returned it.
3546	4	Seriously, this is a very good granola bar--taste, texture, size, etc. I would only suggest that the crumbs be retrained at the factory so that they can restrain themselves from raining down within the package, from the package to the plate, from the plate to the lips, but rather dive happily down upon my taste buds, which, after all, belong to the person who purchased the entire bar for that purpose.
3547	5	These are the PERFECT solution for re-using K-cups. They snap very tightly and handle the Keurig's brewing pressure.  I may even be able to reuse these lids a few times.<br /><br />Each K-cup has a filter inside that does not get punctured by any of the needles.  If you tear off the foil top, clean off the filter by rinsing and lightly brushing with a tooth-brush and the letting them dry (if you want), then you can refill them with your own coffee and snap one of these lids on.  It works perfectly.  I can even store them in my carousel - no leaks, no spilled grounds, no problems at all.<br /><br />It took me 30 minutes to prepare and clean 100 K-cups, 2 days for them to thoroughly dry and about 10 minutes to refill them by dumping the coffee in a stock pot and scooping the K-cups through, then snapping on a lid.  No fuss, no muss, no mess.<br /><br />These things are AWESOME!
3548	5	Product came on time, and was packed like a gift inside box! It was perfect for my husband! all cups where different!! It was a great price and a great purchase!
3549	5	My goodness, we have a hyper dog.  He digs, chews on the sprinkler heads, and has shredded the wood fence.  Chemical deterrents have had poor success, so it was time for an electric fence.  We are impressed with this product.  Our dog grimaced when he was first shocked and has shown care to avoid those areas.  He did not yelp and has suffered no ill effects.  Thank you for the help!
3550	5	Beware - you will love this chocolate.  Not for someone on a diet, because you will not want to stop eating it and before you know it will have polished off the entire almost 1/2 pound  bar  of the best plain milk chocolate in the world.  Let it warm in your mouth to soften ... and ... enjoy the bliss.
3551	1	If you like dark, bold and strong coffee, you will not like Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee.  The product is packaged in convenient one cup serving packets, but it's very weak and almost tasteless.  It took at least two packets to make one half way decent cup of coffee.  Therefore, unless you like watery coffee, I would not recommend that you purchase this product.
3552	5	This water is great.  My friends puppy was sick and we gave her Trivedi Water and the pup recovered right away.  I'm so glad Amazon is going to carry the water.
3553	5	The Blue Diamond Lime Chili flavored almonds is the best flavor hands down.  Packages came sealed, and the almonds were fresh and delicious!  You should also try the Blazing Buffalo Wing and Habanero BBQ. The Wasabi and Soy were too salty for me though.
3554	5	But if you happen to, like me, there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I've found in this country.
3555	5	so glad I can order Kind Fruit and Kind bars at Amazon. They are so very good and I love how quickly they make it to my door!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034EDLS2 >KIND Fruit & Nut, Fruit & Nut Delight, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>
3556	3	I have been a big fan of Dreamfields pasta and have recommended it often, however, I am quite irritated at the manufacturer at the moment.  They recently changed box sizes from 16 to 13.25 ounces and kept the price the same.  This product is already higher priced than most other brands of pasta; I justified the price because of the reduced carbs and comparable taste to regular pasta products, but the sudden reduction from 16 to 13.25 ounces without a drop in price has got me questioning whether I still want to purchase this product.<br /><br />I just went to Dreamfields' website to see if they had an announcement on their homepage concerning the change in size and they didn't; in my opinion a change of this magnitude deserves some mention on their  homepage.  The company sent no announcement of the size change via email (I am on their mailing list). I think the consumer at least deserves an explanation.  Not doing so is bad customer service and there is something about it that seems sneaky to me.
3557	4	I bought this as a gift for a friend. She loved it especially because she loves the original Hershey's kisses. It just looks like a nice small gift and can combines well with anything. Personally, I would rather not receive this gift as it's pretty hard to eat. Either you have to saw at it (which makes a mess) or you just gnaw on it (not attractive). If there's a practical way to consume this piece of chocolate I have not found it.
3558	5	I have read other reviews on here, and thought I would throw in my thoughts.  I have been eating PB2 for a couple of years now.  What I have read from other users is that 2 tbsp of powder shrinks down to 2 tsp when mixed.  I have NEVER had this happen.  I mix 2 tbsp with 1 (plus a little extra) water and have a large amount (I'm talking 2 full tbsp) of  peanut butter  for my sandwich.  I would never put as much real peanut butter on a sandwich as I do this.  So, I don't know if I am doing it wrong, but I find this product to be great for sandwiches, especially if you are watching calorie intake.<br />The price is a little high, but I find it to be worth it.
3559	5	Looking for a cheaper $3.40 a pound brown rice I was purchasing before, I found this rice, it arrived open but I contact amazon and they immediately send me a replacement bag. The rice taste delicious and it was fast to cook.At $1.90 per pound this is a great buy!
3560	5	My friends all love my chili, no beans spiced with 3 kinds of dried chilis,fresh ground cumin etc.  Usually I leave most of the seeds but this time I was meticulous about picking them out.  For spice I added 2 of these (in a tea ball)  When the chili was done I removed the tea ball and mashed the peppers with 2 oz. of finished chili.  Iwould not let anybody use more than 1/4 teaspoon per bowl to spice it up.  Most of these guys are heat freaks but no one asked for more hot and three went and added more chili to calm it down.  I was proud,
3561	4	I must say I loved 5 hour energy!! This product did not taste as bad as I thought it would taste. I was super surprised by the flavor. I used this one morning because I was up most of the night with my son. I had a lot of work to do the next day and I had absolutely no energy! I must say that this product started to work immediately. It was nice to feel that burst of energy. It was actually pretty refreshing to have energy for a change LOL I can honestly say that this will be my number 1 go to when I am exhausted and have a lot of work to do. It actually works!!
3562	5	Very good... I didn't need to add anything to it - just brewed over ice and yummy! I really enjoyed this ice coffee treat and look forward to more flavors in the future I hope!
3563	5	I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the  large or X-Lg  greenie where you get fewer pieces.
3564	4	I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it.
3565	4	I would say this mix is pretty comparable to most trail mixes. I actually add a few chocolate chips, which then makes the perfect mix.
3566	5	I've had dogs before but they were family dogs so were fed the usual Purina or typical grocery store dog foods.  I recently started fostering a pit bull and was given Science Diet for sensitive stomach formula since she had stomach issues.  I used that and her stool was firm but I decided to put her on this food because price isn't as important as her health right?  In a few weeks her fur is amazingly soft!  Anywhere there is short fur it's like stroking a bunny and in the longer areas it's mostly soft and I can tell the rougher stuff is almost all finally gone.  Even in recent pictures I noticed later how shiny her coat is as well.<br /><br />She loves it, her stomach is doing well, and her fur is amazing.  I can't say much about her attitude though since she's as friendly and happy as usual but pits are like that even coming from the worst situations anyway.  Oh yeah, I adopted her last week so she'll be eating Blue Buffalo for a long time to come.  Thank you, Amazon, for having it Prime eligible so it shows up right away.
3567	3	I've been a fan of dried ginger with crystallized sugar for years, so I thought I would give this brand a try.  If you're a ginger lover you will probably like this product, however I like my ginger to be more dehydrated and sliced into smaller pieces.  In fairness it does say  chunk  on the description of the product, and true to that the ginger comes in bite sized chunks that are chewy and kind of gummy.
3568	5	This is hands down the best olive oil in the world. It makes everything taste better. I bought a bottle for everyone in my family for Christmas.
3569	5	Used these glitter (gold, white and silver) on shortbread cookies for Christmas- made them look very pretty, without changing the taste, so the shortbread flavor came through.  At first I was surprised that these were mixed with alchohol (which evaporated) and were painted on, but it was easy, as long as you had a good paint brush.  For larger spaces to cover I could use my fingers, which went faster.  Will buy again, but need to look at the colors- white and silver are very close, and hard to tell the difference unless they are next to each other.
3570	4	This is my 2nd time ordering this product, and when it goes on sale is worth it for a single user. When I was going through chemo it came in handy to have something that was easy to fix that I could do on my own when needing just a little bit of energy.
3571	5	I just put this in my cart because it was low-cost and I needed something to bring my total to $25 for the free shipping.  Well, the ploy worked - I bought it the first time AND I'll be buying it again.  I'm not nuts about coffee-flavored candy but I thought I'd give it a try.  Really good for when that I've-gotta-have-something-sweet in the afternoon hits.
3572	4	I have a fourteen-year-old chihuahua who is missing half his teeth. He has always been a dry dog food grazer who enjoyed picking out a piece or two of kibble and taking his time playing with it a while before he ate it. But he got where he couldn't chew the dry kibble, and for many reasons the canned wet dog food was not working out. This Bil-Jac Senior proved to be the answer. He is able to have the comfort of food in his bowl all day like he's used to, and he can actually eat it when he's hungry. I am grateful for this product because we are both old dogs who are pretty set in our ways.
3573	5	the ones i received from amazon.com were absolutely delicious! i am going to be buying alot more of them.
3574	5	I love this pasta because it's whole-wheat and have a somewhat rough surface to absorb sause. Great taste and good for you, too -- what not to like! I wish that our supermarket offered this product. I also wish that Amazon would offer a smaller amount of packages -- I got a couple of more years of supply. Still I believe this product is worth the money.
3575	3	I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality, if you follow the instructions.<br /><br />However, it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter, especially the commercial ones such as Jiff, Skippy, etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way, since it doesn't have the fat.<br /><br />I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price.
3576	5	My cousin gave me a recipe for Pennsylvania Dutch Chicken Pot Pie... one of her Facebook friends said she found the noodles on line.  I looked, found these, and ordered!  They were exactly what I needed, and tasted delicious!
3577	5	Saw these featured on Hungry Girl and decided to order them for my office snack drawer. The bars have a decent amount of fiber and protein compared to others that contain mostly sugar.<br /><br />They taste delicious. Not too sweet, not too sticky, not too chewy. The peanut butter flavor is not overwhelming. I like these better than my old favorite snack bars(Quaker's crunchy granola bars) and way better than a protein bar taste-wise.<br /><br />Although they are not too sweet I imagine kids will also love them.
3578	5	We love Caribou coffee,plain and simple.  It is my hubby's top 5 coffee's. He loves the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle also.  But Caribou ROCKS!!!
3579	1	These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill. I have many Teas. Let me describe this one. Get compost from a gardening store and brew that in a french press. The burnt leaf taste is pungent. Take the pills and buy some earl grey.
3580	4	This is a miniature wonder I keep at work. How they managed to replicate the original Starbuck's flavor--dark, over-the-top rich roast, I don't know. But I swear it's the same as buying a fresh cup during your morning commute. Most of the oils are dissipated, so you won't have the same strong aroma as freshly brewed, but the flavor is fantastic.
3581	4	This tea is very good, but the packaging is quite deceptive. To begin with, it is not powdered matcha tea, but a leaf tea that is a blend (you can see that it is a blend if you look at the smaller print on the can, but it is a bit misleading). In addition, the tea only fills about a third and maybe even as little as a fourth of the container once you remove it from the bag inside the can. I would buy it again because it is very good tea, but don't buy it if you are looking for matcha and be aware that you're getting less than it might seem.
3582	3	This was purchased as a gift.  My sister said they tasted very good and were really cute.  However, for the $$ you pay, she only got 8 cookies.
3583	1	I will never order from this person again. They took what would be 1. pig ear and cut it into 3 very small strips. Instead of my dog getting one full pig ear he got  strips of a pig ear. What was even worse is that I got 25 pieces of the strips which was equivalent to maybe 8 full size pig ears. I'm sticking with Sam's or Costco. This place ripped me off by charging $17 bucks for strips instead of a full ear.  Additionally, the strips had the hair still attached. My dog loved them anyway but I had to give him 3 at a time to make up for the 1 so the bag lasted for a week. Terrible!!!
3584	5	My wife has recurring extreme muscle spasms, usually late at night or early morning.  We started to use this water for her about 6 months ago.  It has been the best purchase we have ever made [I am not kidding].  I haven't noticed anyone mentioning this benefit, but I can assure you it works!!  We ran out a couple of days ago and had to wait and do without for about 3 days.  She had awful muscle spasms in both legs last night.  Back to where she was before we starting using this water.  We were really thankful that we received 3 cases this morning.  I have vowed  as god is my witness I will never run out of Essentia water again  {from the movie Gone with the wind, ha ha]. But for real, we are now ordering 4 case per month so that we will never run out again.
3585	4	I'm not too sure whether they are working to clean my dogs' teeth or not, but both of them beg for them every morning.  I have two Newfoundlands and they last long enough to give them a good chewing work-out!
3586	5	I have been searching for years for the instant version of americana custard pudding. I am allergic to eggs and this was the only egg free product I could eat, and I loved it. Just mix it in a blender with milk, refrigerate and enjoy. Always got compliments from guests too. Now the americana cook and serve I'm sure is great, but what happened to my instant?
3587	5	I have been on this journey to find healthy alternative(s)for quite some time.  I was reading in a book about flushing the fat and this was the only substitute recommended; so I went to whole foods the next day hoping that they carried the product  stevia plus .  Although, the label did not specify that it was the  plus  version - I took a chance to purchase it.  Now, I'm so glad that I did.  I'm very impressed by it's flavor.  I had tried a few other stevia products but the taste was unbearable.  This is my first review, so I hope someone can appreciate this recommendation.
3588	5	I have been buying these treats both on amazon and at my local pet stores for almost 2 years now.  They are the perfect size for a training treat, they fit nicely into some treat dispensing toys (like the artichoke one that Planet Dog makes), and my dog loves the taste! They are moist, but they have a tendency to get dried out if you don't reseal the bag after opening. They are made in the U.S. and don't have any wheat or corn products in them.  They're also only 3 calories each, and perfect for training since they don't completely fill my dog up!
3589	4	I have the herb version and have been happy with my purchase. Just a couple of issues.<br /><br />The mint are quite lush and if not kept in check, can over crowd the other herbs. My case is especially severe since Aerogarden duplicated the mint in place of the dill.<br /><br />The pump on my machine can occasionally be a little loud and rattlely.  It can be quickly resolved by picking up the water bowl, giving it a gentle shake, and replacing it back on to the base.<br /><br />Overall, much better that a window sill herb garden in the Northeast.  Herbs are clean and ready to use.
3590	1	A half-pack of this (if I can stop at a half-pack) usually suffices when a craving for SOMEthing to snack on fights the knowledge of blood sugar readings that are borderline for type 2 diabetes. Other reviewers have described it most adequately, with nearly all finding it quite enjoyable, perhaps not TOTALLY virtuous, but much healthier than most snack foods. This is the best price I could find for it, at this writing a dime per pack cheaper [[AS OF JUNE 6 50% MORE!]] than at W**-M***. Amazon does not yet offer it by subscription, which would bring further price improvement and freedom from having to place repeat orders.<br /><br />UPDATE: THE PRICE WENT UP BY OVER 50%!!! These were $1.50/bag at a  national discount chain,  so I can no longer recommend buying them from Amazon.  The store had them in stock when I checked, but another store wanted $2.50 per bag.  If Calbee drives the price up so horribly everywhere, I CAN NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.<br /><br />Oh, Amazon, why do you keep doing this to us?  This isn't the first time that your price for a beloved item rose by some huge amount.<br /><br />Ya know what?  We can buy a bag of frozen microwave-steamable sugar snap pea pods or edamame (soy beans, either shelled or in pods) and be eating them five minutes after the urge packs us.  The bags costs less, contain more pods, and contain no fats or seasonings, so we can control the amount and type of added sinfulness.
3591	5	I received a sample and I'm hooked! Please, please put in more stores in Philadelphia & Bucks County area, Would love to see in Bally's health clubs to drink after a workout!!!
3592	5	I used to purchase this tea from a company that no longers offers it so I was very happy to find the same tea at a very good price.  The Genmai Cha has a deeper flavor than regular green tea and I find it more satisfying.
3593	5	I take 5 a day and will update when my bloodwork is done again.  I am hoping for the best!  The taste is better than I thought it would be.
3594	5	In a word: amazing. Imagine chocolate without toxic sugar and gas- inducing malitol. They're high in fiber and great in taste; ChocoPerfection is the way to go if you're on a diet and want to indulge now and then. I believe the woman who makes these delicious treats initially came up with these chocolates as a way to lose weight. Whatever the reason, way to go!<br /><br />I highly recommend them.<br /><br />By the way, if you find the price a bit too high, remember that they are sweetened with erythritol which will command a higher price since that particular sweetener is pricey.
3595	5	I've always been skeptical of drinks like this. Especially energy drinks. They have too much sugar and make you jittery. There's just something about this drink that tastes like vitamins. I personally like the taste of vitamins mixed with this slightly carbonated, strawberry/fruit type of flavor. Most importantly though, every time I've had one of these, I manage to really be able to concentrate on my work. I work from home so it is hard to focus thanks to distractions. But this stuff really helps me zone in and generally makes me feel good. Like it is supplying my body with necessary nutrients. Only 35 calories too. Can't beat that. Definitely going to need to buy a case of this stuff. It definitely seems to help my brain function. I'm seriously not joking. This stuff is great.
3596	5	Wheatena is a comfort food for me.  My father used to make it for us kids when I was little on cold wintry mornings before school.  He did the same for my children when he became a granddad.  Now that he is deceased, a warm bowl of Wheatena takes us all back to those happy mornings.  My local store carried it for a long time.  But suddenly it was discontinued.  Life was a little sadder.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I went online, ordered a four pack and we went through two boxes almost immediately eating a warm filling bowl every morning.  Now that we are satiated, we will do through the last two boxes at a more reasonable pace.  Thank you Amazon and the makers of Wheatena for being around for me and my family for over 50 years.
3597	5	We (I work at a small grocery store) ordered this item at the suggestion of a customer.  When I got around to trying one, WOW!  The drink is sweet, but not overly so, and quite ginger-y.  I love the taste of ginger.  As far as the kick goes, I think it's perfect.  Enough to get you going, but not so much that you won't be able to sleep.<br /><br />I have Raynaud's Syndrome.  Basically, my hands are always cold.  When they become very cold, they hurt pretty badly and turn blue.  Temperature and stress are the main bullies to trigger these attacks.  Caffeine is not good for me either, as it constricts your blood vessels.  For some reason, I can drink this stuff without any bad side effects.  This fact and the taste are why I continue to drink Reed's Energy Elixir.
3598	3	I liked the Banana Rum Cake but not as well as the original flavor. It is very moist as described and keeps moisture as long as it last (does keep well).
3599	5	I like how mild this is.  It works and is much less expensive than most products that work.  I wash my face, apply this for five minutes and it leaves my face so soft and clean.  After removing, I then put <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V0YL4U >Swisa Beauty Anti-Aging Cream, 1.01 -Ounce</a> on my face.  My face is soft and smooth and my skin looks younger.
3600	5	I have three dogs and they all are so adorable carrying these around and they chew for hours!!!!!  love it
3601	5	We have two cats.  One is a large black Bombay 4 years old.  The other a Teal Tabby 2 years old.  We love our kitties.  They are our family.  We tried every cat treat we could find and many large animal supply (and small) chain stores and neither Chester or Pumpkin would have anything to do with them except turn up their nose and walk away.  Then we came on  Temptations .  Now, unfortunately, they whine for them all day.  But, loving parents as we are, they usually get them.  An inexpensive and tasty treat.  They get the best food, and now thanks to  Temptation  the best treats.  All they need to get now is a JOB!
3602	5	my greyhound loves these chews and they have helped with the teeth cleaning process. good product
3603	4	I purchased this mustard because someone I know said that she had this and it was delicious.<br />I have to say that it certainly is delicious.  There is a sharp, spicy bite to it and it is very interesting<br />for a regular sandwich, elevating it to gourmet.
3604	5	After losing so much breast milk while using the Lansinoh brand bags, someone turned me on to this brand. I'd never heard of them before, but am so, so glad I did. They are wonderful, they hold large amounts of milk very well, are sturdy and thick and so far, I've never had a problem with them leaking. I'm so happy I found these, I'll never buy another Lansinoh bag again.
3605	4	My dog is blind and there are very few toys that interest him--okay, the ONLY toys that interest him involve food.  He is about 25 pounds and I got him the medium size Bouncy Bone and the Bristle Bone.  He packs them around the house.  The only reason I gave the gnawhide refills 4 stars instead of five is because they're kind of expensive.
3606	3	 SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia Flavors Tin   indicates to me that the flavor containers would have a storage tin, however they come with only a cardboard container.  The individal flavor containers are plastic bottles.  For the price, I expected a tin storage continer for ease of carrying the flavor containers in my purse. The flavors taste great, but the description of what is being sold is extremely disappointing.
3607	1	The new formulation tastes horrible.  I would be interested to see a chart of their sales before and after implementation because their responses to the long time consumers is that  product testers  like the new formulation.  I would like to know if the  product testers  are buying the product because from these reviews the  long time consumers ...like myself...are not.  I have two boxes at home that i would not feed to my dog.  you suppose it would make a good facial...no it smells terrible also.  maybe wallpaper paste.
3608	1	I was looking for a brewers yeast that I could add to my protein drink so as to be able to get the amazing health benefits of brewers yeast also.  This yeast, while I am sure is quite healthy and a huge health benefit, tastes horrible.<br /><br />The taste so changes the taste of the protein drink, that I found that I actually skipped drinking my protein drink rather than have to endure the taste of it with this brewers yeast.<br /><br />Epic Fail.  Now on to try to find a brewers yeast that doesnt make me shudder.
3609	5	I was concerned about the effect  regular  dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even   high-end  grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!
3610	5	I totally love this product and use it in place of sugar or honey or syrup on cereals, waffles, and desserts.  I like it above Stevia which sometimes can leave a bitter taste. Coconut Secret remains sweet. It was created for diabetic use, having  a low glycemic index.  It's actually made from the flowers of the tree rather than the coconuts themselves - just a great and tasty product.
3611	5	I loved the taste of this...and is my favourite so far. I liked the other vareities of Nong Shim noodles like Ansungtangmyun, hearty beef rice noodle soup, but black shin ramyun is the best.
3612	5	These Stewarts Liver treats are the love of my wirehaired dachshund's life.  Nothing else comes close.<br />I have bought them from several sources and sometimes they are crushed but those fom Amazon arrive in fine condition and ready for munching.
3613	5	I like to think I'am a hot aficionado. I've been in hot chili pepper eating contests and I'am constantly checking out different peppers & hot sauces. So, when I came across Taco Bell's Jalapeno Sauce, I picked it right up.<br /> I originally tried it on a taco and the 'hot tang' was 'just right' to suit my taste. Now, I mix it with other sauces & creams to taste. I use it on my hamburgers as well. I mix a little with my French Onion Dip also. In short, when something requires a little extra in the 'hot' sense, I mix it or apply it straight, according to taste.<br /><br /> In conclusion, If your also one of  The Some Like It Hot Crowd  ...check it out.
3614	4	I used Filet Migon instead of ground beef.  This is a great product and I got rave reviews from everyone that ate.
3615	5	This little known product has such great versatility . it will flavor and season rice , or try it with a little coconut milk to make a sauce for your rice or noodles .
3616	5	I had tried the FRS products (concentrate liquid, chewy snacks and powder supplement that you mix with water) on a free trial from the mfr.  Although I did not sign up for the automatic ship program, I knew this supplement was working because I had more energy to get through the demands of the day than I have had in months.  I continue to take the FRS daily and would recommend it highly to anyone who has depleted energy or just wants to destroy as many of the free radicals in their system as possible.
3617	5	Amazing and yummy, no vegan or veggie-head should go without! Even meat-lovers will enjoy!The Thai Peanut flavor makes it a good protein source to add to things like soup.
3618	5	My mother's dog (a black German Shepherd mix) will go through a  normal  sized rawhide chew in one night.  So I got him this one.  Weeks later one knuckle is still left and well chewed.  So I think this is good value for the money.  Warning, it IS very large.  Give it to a Chihuahua and have your camcorder ready so you can post to YouTube. LOL
3619	4	It is very difficult for me to purchase  exotic  products for cooking where I live.  Definitely appreciate being able to buy coconut milk in bulk and not have to pay for the shipping like you might have to on other websites.  Thanks!
3620	5	This was reasonable priced and I love it. I use it all the time for my kcups and love how it spends around. Good product.
3621	5	Some may not like the taste of real Cinnamon is what I hear.But this is the best I have found and I like it.
3622	5	I am a jerk lover and I had never tried these. Boy, what I have been missing.  These have so much flavor and the pepper.  Hands down best slices ever.
3623	5	This is a brand-new pasta variety from Tinkyada, and it's wonderful!  We have pasta, always Tinkyada, at least once a week, so I have the cooking method down, and it's dependably al dente.  This pasta is much whiter in color than their brown-rice pastas, a little too white to look like glutenous pastas (which may be good).  As for the taste and all-important texture...A+!  My hubby was very complimentary and he and the kids ate evey scrap of the spaghetti.  Tinkyada is very good with gluten-free pastas, and this one is their best yet.  One thing I will say is that you REALLY need to rinse this pasta before serving, because it does make the water it's cooked in very gluey and sticky.  I don't usually rinse the other Tinkyada pastas, but I know some people rinse all of them.
3624	5	I have been drinking coffee for a long time. Years ago, I tried pretty much all the instant coffee brands available in the main stream stores. I didn't care for any of them. My husband is a serious coffee lover and would buy a variety of organic coffees: he would grind the beans in the morning, smell their rich aroma and make himself a cup of coffee. I tried all the brands he bought and was always dissatisfied with the slight bitterness that always lingered. He tried to reduce the amount of beans per cup all the way down to 11 grams. And still, I could taste that slight bitterness that I didn't care for.<br /><br />Eventually, I stopped drinking coffee altogether and switched to non caffeinated coffee substitutes made of roasted barley and chicory.<br /><br />Then we went on vacation this summer and my husband bought a jar of Mount Hagen Instant Coffee for convenience in a health food store. It was nothing short of a revelation. It was smooth, tasty and had none of the bitterness I have come to associate with coffee. I drink mine with raw milk and a little sugar and absolutely love it. It also dissolves easily in cold water if you like ice coffee. It is extremely convenient when travelling. As it is, my husband and I like it so much that he has decided to stop buying any other kind of coffee.<br /><br />I seriously doubt you can make 60 cups out of one jar and at $11.99/jar in the health food stores, it is quite pricey.  However, at $8.25/jar at Amazon if you buy the pack of 6, it is more than affordable if you value your coffee. And of course, it is organic coffee and it is the only brand of organic instant coffee available in the U.S. This brand also comes in a decaffeinated variety.
3625	4	I didn't personally taste this, but my son did and he likes it so that's a winner for me!  I like that it's organic and I also like the container, easy to throw into a diaper bag.
3626	5	I LOVE this product.  If you've never had roasted root veggies sprinkled with sweet onion cane sugar, you have truly never lived.
3627	5	I can find nothing negative about these chips.  They're completely non-greasy and no-mess, so they can be eaten while you're busy doing other things.  They're fresh and high quality.  They taste fantastic.  I'd describe them as vegetable-flavored chips - the crispy crunch of a chip with the clear yet subtle flavors of veggies.
3628	5	These dulse flakes add a  taste of Maine  to Japanese miso. To make a wonderful miso broth, boil water.  Put a very generously rounded teaspoon of Roland white miso into a mug or cup and two teaspoons or so of dulse.  Pour the boiling water into your cup or mug, whisk the ingredients together and enjoy! To make an even more authentic miso soup, add small cubes of tofu and the chopped green ends of scallions (and a little of the white part if you want).<br />This makes a wonderful soup and a tablespoon of dulse contains 330% of the DV  of iodine.  This is a good thing, since popular sea salt often contains no iodine - a necessary nutrient for thyroid health.
3629	5	I wanted a plain wholesome, but fast oatmeal and this is it! I have it every morning and you can mix it with whatever you want. The plus side is there are no added sugars like most instant oatmeals.
3630	5	These cookies are great, however the sellers here on Amazon are thieves. The cookies are less than $4 per package and these pirates have the nerve to ask $7 or more. No way in hell.
3631	3	I love good coffee with rich flavor that doesn't hint of burnt beans. This coffee delivered in that it had an OK flavor without tasting burnt but a felt it was a little more acidic then I prefer. It wasn't a super smooth coffee but it wasn't bad for a quick cup. I don't think I'll be getting this again as I do prefer to grind my own beans but it was a nice change.
3632	5	I am one of those people that LOVES organization, so it goes without saying that I appreciate the design of this storage tray. Now my K-cups have gone from boxes in a drawer to organized rows of specialty brews right at my fingertips. As I'm sure most people do, I have placed my brewer on top of this tray.  The tray is of good quality, with solid construction.  The selection tray slides in and out with ease. Very pleased with this purchase!
3633	5	Very good deal for 3 12-ounce bags of Starbucks Breakfast Blend coffee. Delivered promptly and free. Couldn't ask for more!
3634	4	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40 >The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />The Switch Kiwi Berry is a nice beverage alternate to soda, however, it packs a whopping 33 grams of natural sugar in its 8.3 oz. single-serving can.  I found the taste refreshing and not too sweet, but I am not a regular consumer of carbonated beverages.<br /><br />While this would be a fine alternative to sugar-added, preservative-laden beverages, it contains a high degree of carbs.  Also, the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  If you're watching calories, the 135 in this small can might be better spent on real food.
3635	5	My mother gave me one of those old-time, stand up popcorn makers like you see at carnivals or theaters. Even though we enjoyed it, the popcorn never approached the taste of theaters. That is, until I found this stuff.<br /><br />I came across them in an online recommendation and bought a case. We've never looked back. The stuff is delicious and it makes eating popcorn while watching a movie just like going to the theater.
3636	3	This is the second (and last) time in a few years that I buy Pim's Orange from Amazon. Like the first time, I was disappointed, not because of the cookie itself, which is normally delicious--as a French person, I am very familiar with PIM'S cookies and know what they should taste and look like--, but because of the improper manner in which the packages are stored and handled along the way (I cannot figure out at which end). Obviously, the packages go from cold to hot temperatures (or vice versa), possibly multiple times, which is the worst thing that can happen to cookies incorporating chocolate and filling: this alters their appearance and consistency--chocolate surface becomes discolored and collapses due to melting before regaining some firmness, and the cookie part and filling become too soft. The taste is not affected too badly, but you cannot serve them to guests, because of the cookies' miserable appearence.  In order to save them anyway for my own consumption, I wrap the individual packs in a bath towel and store them in the vegetable compartment of my refrigerator. That helps regain some firmness in the cookies, but of course the chocolate surface remains discolored. So my advice is:  buy individual packs at your grocery store if they carry PIM'S, because the cookies are normally delicious, but do not buy them from Amazon.  It's too bad that Amazon has done nothing so far to correct this storage problem. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, to my satisfaction 99 p.100 of the time, including LU  Petit Beurre  cookies (these are rarely available in US grocery stores). Since they include no chocolate or filling, the shipments are usually in perfect condition.  I give PIM,S Orange three stars because the product is excellent under normal conditions, and the problem is not caused by the manufacturer.
3637	1	I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.
3638	5	they're pronounced like  persnickety  minus the  per . Now, that that's out of the way, these little puffy airy balls are just plain cheesy goodness!! A 4.5oz bag is 4 servings. Ya' know how you feel so guilty when you read labels and then proceed to have just a little more than a serving of something that may not be really all that good for you?? Well, not too worry with these little puff balls. The Nutrition Facts don't read like a death sentence. It's so nice when something good for you tastes like those foods we use to love, but just can't bring ourselves to put in our mouths anymore. Yesterday, I also sampled the Baked Fries, Classic Ketchup (I don't eat ketchup with my fries)and, darned if I didn't come home with a bag. Although my kids are grown, I think these would be a great snack for the little ones.....
3639	1	ProFlowers sent the flowers to ME, the buyer.  Both are saying it's the other persons fault.  Now I am left finding last minute flowers for Mother's Day.  Horrible.
3640	5	Find a baker friend and give some away.  There is a lot here!  The seeds come in mylar bags and are incredibly fresh.  I never realized that store bought was relatively stale.  Highly recommended.
3641	4	I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying  chip  was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.
3642	5	My kitteh Ray Hubbard was a portly tuxedo, with a bit too much gravitas for his own good. Increasing his exercise and switching to Purina One Smartblend Cat Food Chicken/Rice has helped Ray regain his youthful contour, and he is now a fitter, healthier cat! Three purrs and four 'Paws Up' for Purina Chicken and Rice!
3643	5	I found this coffee to be absolutely divine! it has great taste and flavor. I absolutely loved it. Enjoy it.
3644	5	These things are unbelievably good and satisfy so many cravings all at once.<br /><br />First - they are crunchy, so if you have a need for a snack with crunch, this is perfect.<br /><br />Second - the are both sweet AND a little bit salty.  Just enough salt to add a slight tang to the flavor.<br /><br />The texture is great, and the 2-ounce bag is the perfect size ... for yourself.  You won't want to share.
3645	3	I got it today and tasted it right away. I just mixed up a heaping teaspoon with some hot water left over from making tea. It mixed up very quickly & easily. The taste was a little more bland than the regular jar brand to which I am accustomed. I let my Mom taste it and she agreed it's not bad, and she eats a lot more PB than I do. I think it needs jelly or honey :) If you want to know who LOVED it I will tell you - my dog - she licked that little bowl clean.
3646	1	The company did do a refund for the tea. It looks the same as the box that comes from London. However, it is produced in India and has a very strong, almost bitter taste.
3647	5	Super yummy! Really hits the spot when I want a chocolatey snack that won't break the calorie bank.
3648	5	Don't know if they are fattening or not, but they are so yummy.  Even though they have reduced the size of their package for the same amount of money (the old one less olive), they are still worth every dime.
3649	4	We like the chocolate drink.  Not too sweet, just about right.  We also like to add soy milk or coconut milk with it.  Good drink once in a while.  We like it.
3650	5	I'm always tempted when I pass by a grocery store olive bar, but then I wonder how long those olives have been sitting there. When I saw these I thought I'd give them a try. I absolutely love these! Fresh and firm olives in the perfect size pouch. Kalamata olives should be consumed within a few days, so these pouches make more sense than big jars. Tuck a bag in a suitcase or purse for a great snack. I'll be buying them again, they are high quality olives
3651	5	I suppose what makes a cat a cat is that it is finicky. That said, my cat loves these treats. I have read reviews where an owner states their cat hates them. I would suggest that you buy one can at a local store first before you buy a case and see your own pet's reaction. The   Subscribe and Save  option makes this even more of a deal as just when I am running out, another shipment arrives. My cat greets me at the door and expects a couple of these every day!
3652	1	This is just too sweet for me.  Cloying.  It's OK if you dilute it about half and half with plain seltzer.  And an 8.3 ounce can of this has as many calories as a twelve ounce Coke!  I don't buy the line that sweetness from juice is healthier than sweetness from high fructose corn syrup.  As far as my digestion is concerned, one sugar molecule is like another.  The can even boasts that the drink is gluten free!  Oh no - I guess that means it isn't whole grain. :-)<br /><br />I won't be buying this stuff.
3653	4	My household has now eaten a jar of Planters creamy peanut butter and deemed it to be slightly lighter/smoother (i.e. a less-dense paste) and slightly more peanut-y than our current favorite, Jif. When it came time to open a new jar, we chose another jar of Planters.<br /><br />The ingredients (including hydrogenated oils) and Nutrition Facts for Planters are similar to Jif. The Planters package is a bit smaller (16.3-oz vs. Jif's 18-oz) so watch the price. Also watch the expiration date -- mine arrived in September with a best-by date of November. The bottom line is it's a  me too  product alongside numerous others on the grocery-store shelf.
3654	1	Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  Please try another brand like orijen or evo.  your cat will thank you.
3655	5	I bought a cotton candy machine, but it didn't come with any floss sugar.<br />I tried using regular sugar and it was okay, but I really wanted some good colors and flavors. I bought this product and I am very satisfied with the amount of sugar and the diversity of flavors (it should last me awhile). I can't wait to make all sorts of crazy combos! :)
3656	1	If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of  guac-a-mole  flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended)  new look, same great taste  icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the  Mad-Men  era I grew up in.
3657	1	I will admit that I like strong flavorful but not burnt tasting coffee. I give four stars to the Tully House Blend, but this Breakfast Blend is quite weak.<br />After ordering fifty of them, my husband and I in desperation have been trying to use them up by putting a kcup on espresso setting and using 2-3 kcups on Expresso  as needed to fill up our coffee cup. I'm sure it's a  fine Kcup if you like weak coffee, but...
3658	5	If you don't like BROWN RICE but want to add more fiber to your side dish of rice, this is the one. This rice mix is savory, fragrant and cooks up lightly cruncy and tender. It is utterly delicious. It makes a great pilaf and is good just plain. We even eat it for breakfast with a bit of honey and butter. And when you finish off the rice, you have a nice container for nuts or other dry ingredients for the pantry. This is a terrific blend of rice.
3659	4	I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.<br />I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.<br />If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others.
3660	5	I've been suspecting that my dog has grain allergies so we decided to try better foods out there as she's been switching every few months. She is on Ziwipeak freeze dried food but after she was ill last year, she became accustomed to wet food so we've been finding her different canned foods to use as toppers. Fromm is decent but after a bad batch of over 15 cans and noticing that our puppy was drinking excessive amounts of water, we wanted to find alternatives to Fromm and Ziwipeak canned because she gets bored easily. After trying Taste of the Wild, Merrick, Great Life, Wellness, etc, she was ecstatic when we let her sample Addiction. She loves it! There's different flavors to choose from (all of which are grain-free!) and the consistency is a little softer than pate and it actually doesn't smell awful like most canned dog foods out there.<br /><br />She's tried the Venison Stew and Turkey with Cranberries and Apples and loves both. We're going to see how she likes the other flavors available.
3661	5	I am so thankful that Amazon has these wonderful almonds! Our WalMarts used to carry them and made a big mistake discontinuing them. There are six people in my office alone that LOVE these Jalapeno almonds and we have looked everywhere for them! I hope we will always be able to find them here!<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK >Blue Diamond Almonds, Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse, 6-Ounce Can (Pack of 6)</a>
3662	4	I try not to buy a lot of bottled water.  It's expensive, and I don't like the extra plastic it creates even though I  always try to find a recycling bin for my empties.  However, there are those days where I forget my water bottle or want more to drink than I carried with me.  For those few days, I'd choose Essentia drinking water as often as I choose spring water even though Essentia comes from municipal sources.  Essentia's silky texture is very cool.  It reminds me of the lake and creek water we drink when out and about in rural Alaska (NOTE: you should NOT drink lake and creek water without verifying its safety).  I chose to try out Essentia since I was curious about the whole 9.5 pH thing.  I don't feel any difference in consuming this pH of water, but did find it nice to drink as water.<br /><br />In short, I can't say I'll be a regular consumer of Essentia since I'm not a regular consumer of bottled water.  But on the few days that I am, this is a choice I'd make.
3663	5	We ordered this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas. He is ill and can't leave the house. The order arrives on time every month and is in perfect condition. This is the only cereal that he will eat and it makes us feel good to know that he will have it even when we aren't able to go shopping for him. Thank you.
3664	5	I have enjoyed a low carb lifestyle for a couple of years now, with great success. I have tried a number of low carb products and Bobs Red Mill is on top of my list! The pancakes and muffins I make taste great!! You can make a complete low carb breakfast!!  The Amazon price is a bargain especially with free shipping.
3665	5	Land O Lakes hot chocolate is the best hot chocolate ever and all<br />you do is add water.  It's rich and makes a large mug.
3666	4	The source of protein in Hemp seeds is much easier to ingest than  whey.  The flavor is very good, rather nut like and is very good on whole grain cereals.  I've cut down on red meat and use the hemp seed product to keep a handle on the protein that my body is asking for.  I'm 61 years old and am an active outdoors person.  I do not take junky supplements of any kind in tablet or capsule form.  This source of protein is natural and delicious.
3667	5	We purchased this product based on a recommendation from our Vet. Our young dog really enjoys these as a treat. They are relatively long lasting, and appear very satisfying to our pup.The Amazon price was a great incentive - and we will purchase again when we run short! Good product, good service.
3668	1	This stuff is horrible!!!  I ruined batch after batch of hummus using this... even just the smallest dab of this will ruin everything it comes in contact with.
3669	5	My parents sent me some of these in care package while I was deployed and they are amazing.  So much better than nature vally bars.
3670	5	While in Ireland last summer, I drank Bewley's tea at the B&B in Kilkenny and bought a box at Dunne's to bring home. Those bags ran out long ago, so I ordered some online. Drinking Bewley's is like being back in Eire, walking in the garden smelling the lavender and loam. As soon as you drop the bag in the hot water, it begins to swirl a rich, dark brown, and in only a minute you have a wonderful cup of aromatic, flavorful tea.<br /><br />I've ordered from Bewley's before - hampers last time - and have not been disappointed. I was glad I could order though Amazon [...]. At last, I've found a place where I can order black pudding. If you want a taste of Ireland, get some Bewley's.
3671	5	I like strong coffee and have only bought  bold  flavors since getting my Keurig (the best invention since sliced bread). I must say that this is the strongest one I've found...really like the flavor and boldness. Again, I like strong coffee, but this is the first time that I've bought a k-cup flavor that stands up to a normally brewed cup of coffee -- bravo!
3672	1	though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did
3673	3	This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a  half diet  drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.
3674	5	This Fruit Dip Peach Passion Mix is Awsome!!! It was the hit of the get together I had with my friends a few afternoons ago. Just mix with Sour Cream, or Sour Cream and Cream Cheese and serve with fruits in season. I used Strawberries, Peach and Nectarine Slices and Rasberries. Make certain that you mix it up and let it sit in the refrigerator at least an hour prior to serving so the flavors can mingle. It is that simple. Then you too can be the hostess of the hour!!!WOW. Am I glad I found this!!!<br /><br />I put it together very quickly...it only took 5 or 10 minutes to find a fancy bowl and serving plate. Then, I mixed up the dip using half Sour Cream and half whipped cream cheese. It only took one cup of each. I made it up the night before because I wanted to be absolutely certain the flavors mingled and mixed as much as possible. I stored it overnight in Tupperware, then the next day popped the dip into a beautiful cut glass dish. I put that in the middle of a large decorative, serving plate and surrounded the cut glass dish with fruit. Every single person commented on how good this was.<br /><br />It is quick, not expensive, and looks really pretty. If you are the artistic type, I imagine you could decorate or garnish this dip (the photo on the package shows it decorated with mint leaves) and make it look really smashing.<br /><br />I have already ordered more and plan to keep this flavor, or some flavor appropriate to the season, on hand at all time. It has become an instant staple in my pantry. Give it a try and I think that you too, will become an instant  star hostess , and will keep it on your pantry shelves. This was an absolute blessing of a find. Hope you enjoy it nearly as much as I and my friends have!!!!!
3675	4	First off, I must say that my wife absolutely feel in LOVE with this granola. I almost didn't get to have a taste of our first bag before it was gone! She would easily rate it 5 stars, but needless to say I have my own opinion.<br /><br />Being a bit of a chocolate granola snob, I have to compare the flavor and texture of this granola to that of <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAMK5O >KASHI COCOA BEACH GRANOLA</a> and <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZ9R3O >Cascadian Farm Cereal, Dark Chocolate Almond, Organic, 13.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>, my long-time favorite. I have enjoyed all three as both a snack and a meal, usually with milk.<br /><br />Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is more enjoyable than the Kashi as both a snack or as a meal. The flavor of the Kashi can be a bit too generic, and this granola just tastes healthier and more natural. As a snack, my only complaint is the amount of small bits that are hard to snack on. Perhaps my wife got all the large morsels before she let me have a taste, but I do feel there should be more uniformity for best enjoyment. This is not as important in a bowl, of course.<br /><br />I enjoyed a medium sized bowl with milk, but this is where the Cascadian Farms granola takes it a step further. I ALWAYS want a second bowl of Cascadian Farms because it just tastes so good, but here I didn't find myself going back for more. While this does lead me to rate this granola just below my personal favorite, it might be a positive point as others trying to lose weight (such as myself) are less likely to give in to the urge for  just one more bowl .
3676	5	Great deal and good coffee.  It is a little too strong for me but I am a wimp..  I will buy it again but I will get a different type.
3677	5	This Stash Premium Decaf White Raspberry Tea is delightful-cold or hot!!<br />It is also very good mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with decaf green tea. It is an<br />all-round wonderful tea. It is great using 1 bag per cup. But if you like<br />stronger tea use several bags per cup. I have not met a person who<br />doesn't like it. I love it!!!
3678	5	This is some of the best tea I have had.  I will buy more when I run out.
3679	3	After drinking the powdered energy drink offered at the supermarket I thought I would reward myself and experiment with this more costly product.<br />I found it hard to mix well, the tiny clumps were few, but in the three boxes I purchased I have yet to mix a drink that has not had them in it. It doesn't bother me but this is a review. The orange flavor and lemon lime flavor I found acceptable and what I expected. It is recommended to consume 30-60 minutes prior to activity. It may be imagined but I feel a little rush within minutes of consumption but it only last a few minutes and I see no notice in my exercise before, during or after. The powdered energy drinks I buy at the supermarket have caffeine and an immediate and sustained zing for my exercise which I prefer.<br />FRS is not a caffeine drink but because it is an energy drink I expected more. I will not buy again.
3680	5	OK, the only bad thing about these is that there are 60 in a box. Otherwise, they are delicious, perfect sized pieces.
3681	4	My dog likes thse alot..He runs to his bedroom to eat them, which is reserved for just his special treats..Can't say his breath is any better but he just started eating them a month ago,or so..
3682	5	This is the same product that I have been buying a local grocery stores for years.  There were no noticable quality differences.  The price, at 25% of the least expensive local grocery supercenter (including shipping and handling), was quite noticable.<br /><br />Will be buying this product again.
3683	5	I first tried these after reading about them here on Amazon grocery.  I am very pleased with the product.  I like the idea that they are organic and support native farmers.  I use some every day in my tea and even got to like eatig them right out of the package.  I liked reviewing the other comments as I am looking for ideas for other uses of these great nibs!
3684	4	It's been a while since I've enjoyed a flavored coffee. I'm something of a purist and honestly, most flavored coffees taste artificial and over-done to me.  But Starbuck's has come through with a very natural-tasting vanilla-flavored coffee for coffee drinkers who want a bit more without the addition of a sugary syrup.<br /><br />The scent of the coffee is a nice vanilla-coffee blend with the vanilla more understated than I'd have expected. As it brews, the scent of vanilla rounds out the coffee aroma without ever overpowering it.  And the cup is smooth and almost velvety, pretty much all you could hope for from this sort of blend.<br /><br />I'm not saying they've won me over to the flavored coffee camp, but I will say that this is a cup of coffee I can respect in spite of the addition of a flavor. If you love vanilla coffee but hate artificial flavors, give it a try.  I think you'll be pleased.
3685	4	I've been buying primarily whole leaf, oolong, pu'er, jasmine teas from a wholesale tea market in Beijing (Malian St). Though the price is far cheaper than the Ten  Fu (Ten Ren) teas and other retailers, the discernment in quality seemed questionable. I am a simpleton concerning tea. So rather than purchase $90/kg for the base Assam tea, I went to Carre4 and bought an under $5/box of Lipton Yellow label Black tea 100 bags for the consistant quality.
3686	5	My favorite is the Vanilla Almond Crunch.  Delicious and healthy.  Add plain yogurt and berries on top for a nice snack or dessert.
3687	4	Includes two of each of the following varieties: Breakfast Blend, Parisian Nights, Espresso Extra Bold, Colombian Dorado, Italian Blend, Hazelnut, Colombian Decaf.,  Green Tea ,English Breakfast Tea & Canarino.<br /><br />NO KONA OR CHAI TEA,<br />they sent  French Roast, Ethiopian Kimssa instead
3688	3	I am a dog trainer and this was a cool vine item to review. I always need new cool dog stuff. The dogs liked the toy /reward once they got a few licks. I love the ease of portablitiy,no pocket mess!!!!! ease of use.<br />dogs like it!!! will work for the bacon one.<br />*****bad news, single use container, no refills, nada. Formed plastic one time use. so 1990s sigh. sigh . sigh . very bad for the planet. please do not buy a plastic waste like this. I would pay extra for refillable container. anyone have one?
3689	3	I wanted to like the Whole Wheat Shells & Cheddar.  I really did.  But the sauce really is quite watery and bland, even with adding the optional butter/margarine.  Alone, cooked per instructions, my kids wouldn't eat this.  I certainly couldn't feed it to kid guests used to traditional mac-n-cheese.  But I discovered that if I mixed in some leftover spaghetti sauce it becomes quite tasty.  I use a jarred sauce added to browned ground beef.  Now that makes a very hearty and tasty meal.
3690	5	I am so happy to see these carried on Amazon. I have been buying them from my local health food store, but I am going to start buying them in bulk here.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I buy very few processed foods. I make nearly everything from scratch including: pasta, bread, tortillas, crackers, ground meat, baked goods, marshmallows, etc. I feel like I have very high standards for grocery items. The only reason I even tried these was that I have a ton of respect for Rick Bayless. I have several of his cookbooks and I have enjoyed many awesome meals and learned a ton from them.<br /><br />Anyway I have tried 4-5 varieties of these pouches: the red enchilada, the green enchilada, the fajita, and the beef taco. All four of them blew me away! To the point where I actually wonder if I should even bother with making any of it from scratch anymore.<br /><br />Take my word for it.... these are totally worth the money! I will always keep them on hand.
3691	2	Though my three pups liked the taste of these healthy treats, they crumbled into tiny bits.  I would not buy these again.  Now I give the pups Blue Buffalo Wilderness biscuits that I break into smaller bite sized bits for our three elderly Maltese dogs.
3692	5	Purchasing Starbucks Via in these 50-package containers is the least expensive way to buy this great coffee.  If you tried Starbucks Via Colombian Roast and were not impressed, try the Via Italian Roast, whose taste is far superior IMO.
3693	5	I had a lumpectomy so could only feed baby from one breast.  I definitely noticed a difference once I started drinking it 3 times a day.  Flavor is not bad, too.  Depending on how much I hydrated, I could get up to an extra ounce-and-a-half from my hard-working boob.
3694	1	The product contains suralose. This may be a bonus to some, but for us, it's a deal breaker. We can not stand the taste of artificial sweeteners, and both my husband and I agree the aftertaste in this beverage is too much to tolerate. I would have preferred if the product would have highlighted this fact before I purchased it at a local supermarket.(Which I had decided to try some of the k-cup products there before purchasing large batches from Amazon.)<br /><br />If you like the taste of sweeteners like suralose, this product may be for you. It is not too watery when made on the 7.25 oz portion size, and is an acceptable instant hot chocolate otherwise.<br /><br />I just wish there was a k-cup hot chocolate not made with an artificial sweetener, even if it had to be unsweetened or add your own sugar. I have yet to find any hot chocolate product like that, and it appears all Cafe Escape products contain suralose.
3695	4	Started using this product the latter part of 2010 and find it to be a suitable protein powder for me. I lift weights myself, and also instruct people as well, and find that it helps you to keep and add lean muscle mass without extra fat gain. I recommend it to all my clients, especially those trying to lose weight/fat.
3696	5	This is excellent espresso coffee. I have bought multiple packs of this coffee in the past year, but have never before reviewed it. I use it both in my stovetop percolator and my electric espresso machine. It has never disappointed, always great quality, excellent crema and refreshing results! 5/5 stars.
3697	4	Like the coffee. Love the single cup system. Delivery was fast and reliable as always.  And really, it does have a nice coffee kick, but it won't give you the jitters.
3698	5	Apart from the BPA in the can lining, these are a great product. It is cheaper for me to have these delivered to my door than it is to buy them at the local store (which isn't locally owned)
3699	3	The ingredient list tells the tale: hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry leaves, natural flavor (presumably the vanilla), dried black current (sic) pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.  This isn't blackberry vanilla tea; this is hibiscus rosehip tea with some added flavoring.<br /><br />The problem is that hibiscus is an acquired taste that I never successfully acquired and do not appreciate here, but lovers of hibiscus and/or rosehip tea should add a star for each love.<br /><br />At least the pyramid shaped teabag works as advertised.
3700	5	Gets me nice and pumped before a workout.. yes I'm sure it's all the caffeine (250mg in one scoop) but oh well.. I couldn't imagine working out without it.. tastes great too!
3701	5	These are the best! They remind me of rice crispy treats. They're so chewy and delicious. I recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products.
3702	5	These arrived fresh and in very good shape, Just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door!
3703	4	These are really great nuts.<br />One thing though, they have too much salt and pepper.<br />Just use a strainer and shake them for a few minutes.
3704	5	While I love chocolate, I normally do not like chocolate flavored things. You know, things that aren't chocolate but are meant to taste like chocolate, such as chocolate Bonne Bell Lip Smackers, chocolate flavored Skittles, and cheap  chocolate  easter candy. I thought this would taste like super-watery chocolate milk and kept the first bottle I bought in the fridge for a month because I was too scared to try it, but I was completely wrong. It's delicious!!! If I had to describe the taste, it would be like melted dark chocolate gelato with a hint of coconut. I work at a small, outrageously overpriced local grocery store and we are selling it there for 2 dollars over the price of the per unit adjustment of a case here on Amazon (though I bought my bottle at one of those trendy chain health food stores for 1 dollar more over Amazon's price). So buy one bottle to see if you like it, and order the rest on Amazon. These prices can't be beat.
3705	5	I gave this to my Mother and she loved it.  But, a word of caution; the tea if steeped too long is VERY strong.
3706	5	It doesn't matter how many antibiotics I take, or how much cough medicine,but when the chips are down, Mullein Tea fixes the cough.<br />OK not 100%, but I'll take 90% any day.  Make a pot, and drink it all day.  Hot with honey?  or tepid, plain.  Reheat it in the microwave. Or not.<br />This centuries old remedy will help.  And, it can't hurt.  Worth a try!
3707	1	Read the fine print before you buy this! I got it as a gift for a friend who is allergic to gluten but loves licorice. Turns out this is for 6 teeny tiny, barbie doll sized boxes of licorice. What look like juicy, chewy licorice bits in the photo are about the size of ice cream sprinkles in a tiny box. Plus they taste TERRIBLE and Amazon won't let you return food items, so now I'm stuck with a bunch of inedible tiny boxes of licorice! Yuck!
3708	5	I write very few reviews but this product changed my life. I have suffered from constipation all my life and I started to drink this daily as a friend recommended this for me to try- what a life changer- If I don't drink it for a few days I go right back to being constipated! This is a product I can never be without!<br /><br />I recommended this to a friend and a few months when I saw her she said that she recommended this to all her friends and they all started to lose weight :) and my friend lost 30lbs only drinking this, eating clean and working out a few days a week! You have to try this product, I cannot say enough good things about it.
3709	5	I love brewed cacao beans.  So much to offer - loaded with antioxidants, flavor and great taste.  Try it - you will like it.  Cream and sugar add to the delightful concoction.
3710	5	My wife loves this K cup and after checking prices all over , the regular delivery of Emerils was the best deal going!!
3711	1	You need to use like a ton of it to get the actual hazelnut taste off this. Hence it makes it very expensive as it doesn't last at all. Returned it.
3712	3	For the price, these bags did the job.  However, be very aware that the size of the bag is SLIGHTLY shortened width wise b/c of the drawstring so ensure whatever you are putting into it is smaller.
3713	5	Consistent smooth flavor that is a bit more robust than mid range roasts without the strong bite that some of the darker roasts have.  I like to create my own coffee  brews  and ofter pair Seattle's Best 4 (Henry's Blend) with Givalia Traditional Roast for my morning coffee.
3714	4	I've been using this product for about a month and do see some improvement in the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have chronically 'clogged' sinuses, so I was happy to find something that seems to alleviate the resulting darkess/swelling I get from this. Hopefully as I continue to use this product, I'll see even more improvement. It is also very gentle--some products have caused redness and irritaion around my eyes. And I like the scent--reminds me of cocoa butter.
3715	4	I love Celsius. Granted, I've failed to continue any workout regiment for over 2 years now and I've barely put on weight. I don't have a fast metabolism. At all. But for me, Celsius is kinda like my safety net. I worry about what I put in my body, about the lack of exercise I do. And this takes away the guilt feeling for a little while.<br /><br />But. I haven't been receiving what I've paid for. I've recently been receiving 2 Sparkling Cola, 3 Raspberry Acai Green Tea, 3 Sparkling Orange, 2 Orange, 2 Sparkling Wild Berry. Where is my favorite Peach Mango Green Tea? Or Strawberry Kiwi, Iced Lemon Tea, Apple Orchard Blend? I've recently been getting 2 Iced Lemon tea but I didn't get any this time! I prefer the non-carbonated ones more but I'm not even getting those.<br /><br />It should list what you're getting instead of false information. The product itself is fantastic. But I'm not getting what I paid for.
3716	1	I ordered multiple ones of this and not had the gift message i wrote in so the ppl had no idea who sent it! so pathetic!
3717	5	I love Lipton Cup-of-Soup!  I keep tons of them in my office and snack on them.  The chicken and spring vegetable versions are low in calories, but I find them satisfying and filling.  The prefect snack!
3718	5	I've tried the big sheets before and liked them but thought they were to big and messy.  These are perfect snack size and I love the salty onion flavor.  They are fun to eat, sort of like cotton cant where you let it melt on your tongue.  I didn't think these would be very filling since they are like little paper sheets but surprisingly after one pack I'm satisfied.
3719	5	I agree with the product description, its a great hydrator. There are plenty of electrolytes to recharge you after a good workout. plus the good amount of potassium also helps! As a person who doesn't really like bananas i rely on vita coco for my potassium. Also its very refreshing! try the mango and peach flavor too its great!
3720	4	I love my hemp hearts. I had a difficult time the first three weeks getting my body accustomed to them. The hearts had an opposite effect on me than other customers about whom I have read.  I now eat them daily and find I have more energy, plus, the overall effect seems to be positive.
3721	5	I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.
3722	1	the tea is fine, slightly weak, but how in the world did they come up with such a high price? Its foolish to buy it through Amazon sellers when there are other areas to buy it cheaper. My local grocery store (Giant) sells it cheaper!
3723	3	I really like coffee and I really like cold coffee drinks. So how was this one? Basically this tastes a lot like McDonald's coffee with some milk and sugar. It was drinkable but not something I would spend money on. It did seem to have a lot of caffeine, even I felt this one. If you really like the coffee at Micky D's, go for this. If not, I would suggest passing.
3724	5	I love this tea, since it's not easy to find in stores Amazon is the easiest way to purchase Tazo Passion Tea.
3725	3	Nabisco has come out with several good products lately.  This, unfortunately, is not one of them.  I recently tried a crispy cranberry-orange cookie of theirs that was one of the best tasting things I've ever had in my entire life... and I'm OLD (53).  These cookies are surprisingly small in diameter (between 1 1/2 and 2 inches).  I was expecting three inch wide cookies (what I'd consider  normal  for this type of product).  In the end though, the size doesn't matter (!) - they just don't taste very good.  I love chocolate, but I'd take those cranberry based cookies any day instead of these.
3726	5	this is wonderful coffee and all we drink now, more expensive than basic coffee but way worth it. It comes quickly in the mail with free shipping from Amazon
3727	5	This formula is a life-saver!  Our 2-month old had a little viral bug, which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy.  With this formula, he barely spits up at all and has been so much happier!<br /><br />Ask your doctor for a sample!  When we took our baby in for his tummy troubles, the doc gave us a full-sized can of this formula to take home and try!  Considering it costs about $14 retail, this was great!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Reduced spit-up and gas<br />Reduced fussiness<br />Easy to mix up<br /><br />Cons:<br />Baby can't go as long between feedings, probably because it's easier to digest<br /><br />You can also get 2 free cans of Similac (one Advance and one Sensitive) by mail if you register at their website.  Great product and great customer service!
3728	5	These are great tasting cookies that go with coffee in the mornings or for that matter anytime of the day.  Just love them.  To bad shipping is so expensive these days.
3729	5	A great tasting tea with plenty of anti-oxidants.  Easy to make, easy to store.  Even the kids like it.  A good value as well.
3730	5	Our names are Lottie Dot and Shortie. Everyday we have flaked tuna and egg for breakfast. We will not eat anything but this combo. Yum and Purrr.
3731	5	I have been buying Mothers Cookies from Amazon, and they all are excellent.  My most recent purchase of Mothers Iced Oatmeal cookies are great!
3732	5	It's healthier than most meat snacks, and it is filling. Great for those moments that you are either too busy or too lazy to make a meal. The fact that it's individually wrapped allows you to always carry one with you. I leave some at work for when I get hungry or for when I am so busy that I don't have time for lunch. My favorite flavor is the original, followed by the peppered. This is also a great price per oz.
3733	3	When I received this product, it smelled so good and fresh! For me personally, however, I prefer the Marques de Paiva organic decaf taste. While I definitely will still finish this coffee, it is not as smooth as Marques and sort of smoky tasting (I am not a coffee expert so I am not sure of the correct description words). However, just to have organic is great! And it definitely comes recently roasted which is a plus.
3734	5	Bakto scientists have found a way to extract the pure essence of mango flavor from the world's most popular fruit.I think this is their premier extract and my faovorite way to enjoy it is to made a light greek yogurt with it. To 16 oz of Chobani lo-fat plain yogurt, drizzle 8 cc (1 1/2 tsp) of Mango extract and 2-3 tiny spoonfuls of Kal stevia. Wait 10min for the alcohol to evaporate. Mix and refridgerate. Thats 5 star mango yogurt.
3735	5	Sensible foods are a little pricey but the quality and healthiness are there. These individual snack packs are great when you're on the go. They are always fresh and tasty. I highly recommend them.
3736	5	You will see that this coffee will retail between 12-13 dollars a bag, if the retail price is above this amount, you are being taken on a Amazon ride towards their higher profit margins.<br />And, this 12-13 dollars a bag is price BEFORE all possible promotional codes that you would utilize to make that coffee lower than that 12-13 dollars a bag.<br />Have bought countless orders of this coffee, enjoy this coffee,it is very good,though unwise to consider ever paying more than price mentioned above,since you deserve better price anyways.<br />For any reason you ever bought this coffee at the lower anticipated price of 12-13 dollars a bag,gets delivered and you decide to re-order more coffee and that good price has turned to a higher price, you are entitled to a refund if you have already had this coffee shipped within the past 30 days.<br />What you do is buy at the regular price now, get confirmation order number, then telephone Amazon website phone cust service and request your refund to be applied back to you as long as not more than 30 days have passed since you had received any of this coffee.<br />That money will be applied back to your Amazon balance for you to spend again, or refunded that difference back to your creditcard had you used a credit card for that order original placed.<br />If you have NOT purchased this coffee at the better anticipated 12-13 dollars a bag, and more than 30 days have passed, you will not get a refund,so do NOT buy at full inflated price unless that price decreases to 12-13 dollars fair price.<br />Besides, nobody wise will pay Amazon 18 dollars or more for this coffee and feel that they got a good deal.<br />Hope my advice is of your benefit too.
3737	4	This is a convenient little energy drink additive (key word, it's a concentrate and it's meant to be added to something else). Simply hold it over your drink, give it a squeeze, and it will shoot a dose into your drink. As far as what to put it in? I wouldn't recommend water. Alone, this tastes like medicine. If you add it to crystal light or something, it's good. You'll taste it, you'll know it's there, but it isn't bad and it will turn your regular beverage into an energy drink.
3738	2	I ordered this because it was natural and nitrate free.  I just received my shipment - it is very tender as others have said but I found it much too sweet for my taste.  The sugar overpowers the pepper flavor and is not what I expected.  If you want something that is more sweet than peppery or spicy you will like this brand.
3739	5	This is a great tasting coffee. Not only good first thing in the morning, but anytime. Very smooth. Green Mountain puts out great tasting coffee on all flavors and blends
3740	4	This is almost as good as the Italian dressing ~ we love it. And it's so easy to make.
3741	4	I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.  Like others, I was unaware these were for 'pod' brewers, although this has been since updated to state in the product description.<br /><br />In fact, the box has NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back to Amazon to find out about using 8oz of water per cup.  A little less Marley/Jamacia on the box, and a few more instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Since I don't own a pod brewer, I tried using a pod in my 'cup at a time' brewer.  All I got was slightly flavored hot water.  Not recommended.  Next I tried brewing one directly in a cup by adding boiling water.  While I got flavor, I also got sediment and aftertaste.  Again, not the recommended method.  Finally, I tried snipping open a pod and just using the loose grounds in my 'cup at a time' brewer with a standard paper filter.  I realize this is not the way the manufacture intended their product to be used, but as I said, since I was unaware this product was for 'pod' coffee makers, it was the best I had to work with.<br /><br />At last, I got to taste Marley's Organic Coffee in a good way.  Overall, I did like the taste (I drink mine with creamer).  Although I have to admit that I would not buy these at such a high price for just 15 cups of coffee.  Maybe if I had a pod brewer, I would.  But I really don't taste that much different to any other cup of good coffee.  As I said, I am not a coffee connoisseur, just someone who enjoys a good cup on occasion.<br /><br />This box of Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee includes 15 individually foil wrapped coffee pods, so that each cup will be as fresh as the last.
3742	5	Am I really writing a review for gum?<br /><br />Great for the HCG diet. No sugar, cinnaminty... Yum.<br /><br />I love having the big tub of it. What more can I say? I eat the stuff like candy.
3743	5	I have a large German Shepherd who is a bone a Holic. These hings are big and meatty and massive. He goes through th esmall bone 5 - 7 inches in 2 days. These take him a week! Great deal all around!
3744	5	I grew up in Seattle and Starbucks French Roast is my addiction. Since it is not available in K-Cups I have tried every kind of french roast or dark roast K-cup and found this one. For those who like strong dark roast, this is the best.
3745	5	this flavor is soooo good!its very smooth and the flavor is not too strong. its just good! its a regular in our house now. everyone loves it.
3746	4	I like STRONG coffee.  This is as close as I have found yet to the bold factor I love!
3747	4	Sent to my sister and she loved them!  Kind of costly but had free shipping which offset mailing cost to purchase and mail.
3748	4	I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this product, but once you get used to the idea of mixing up your own peanut butter, it's really quite good. I have tried both the plain and the peanut/chocolate version, and I prefer the one with the chocolate for eating on rice cakes and such. However, I have been adding the plain to my chocolate protein shakes, and that works really well too. It's like drinking a candy bar. If I eat the plain one as peanut butter, I usually add some Truvia or honey, because it just doesn't seem sweet enough on it's own. If you order the peanut/chocolate version, I highly recommend sizing up, because it goes rather quickly, and you will wish you had more. You will also save on shipping.
3749	5	I love this line of organic olive oils and vinegars.  I use the Meyer lemon olive oil, blood orange olive oil, cassis vinegar, zinfandel vinegar, white balsamic, and champagne vinegar.  I love to make my own dressings and vinaigrettes for inventive salads and these olive oils and vinegars are my staple ingredients for doing so.  I then whisk in all sorts of other components like a little flavored mustard, honey, chili pepper flakes, various chopped fresh herbs, maple syrup, or some macerated strawberries (with balsamic) or raspberries (with the champagne vinegar).<br /><br />I love all of these products but the Meyer lemon is my absolute favorite.  I love lemon, especially in salads, drizzled on seafood, or as a finishing touch to any cooked dish.  The flavor in this olive oil is bright, natural, and aromatic.  I don't often use it to cook, however, because I think the flavor is best enjoyed out of the bottle or drizzled on a finished dish, especially Italian soups like a ribollita.  I also sometimes pour a little of each flavored O olive oil onto small saucers for guests to sample with bread and a few cheeses and it's a huge hit.  They love to taste and compare the flavors.<br /><br />If you're looking to make more exciting salads or just love good, quality organic products, the entire O olive oil line is good but the Meyer lemon olive oil is delicious!
3750	5	This is the best candy ever!!!! Certain Walgreens used to sell it but it was hard to find.  One day I was online and was happy to see that I could buy this product in bulk.  Also, the price is GREAT!!!! Will purchase again!!!!
3751	1	Hey Gang,<br /><br />My tea arrived in a box within a box with some bubble wrap and packaging.  However, I found the box in the middle of my driveway on a hot day (which is a bad omen to begin with).  Why wasn't it on the porch?  Why not at least leaning up against the garage?  Was it thrown onto the driveway by a harried UPS worker?  What I do know is that I can't use one of the jars (it arrived broken) and it's not returnable.  In today's economy, I'm trying to make smarter decisions with where I throw my money.  This tea product is a luxury for me.  I, like you, have roamed around stores without luck of finding the product.  I decided I'd go with Plan B which is to search the Internet and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  However, Plan C is to  move on  and most likely start making  Cold Brewed Iced Tea  from tea bags.  Good luck if you order this... but maybe it's time to  move on.   Lipton is thriving on the shelves but Nestea tastes better in my opinion! I give the tea 4 stars for taste but one star for packaging.
3752	5	Babys loves this one and so do I.  Love the packaging to- no jars to wash.
3753	4	This pasta is great for people with Celiac.  I think the taste is great and when you miss your pasta, this is a great subsitute.  It does take longer to cook and is better when rinsed in hot water before serving.  Does not go mushy like other brands.
3754	4	This is the one that you want to keep your Keurig on the small size setting for. Too much water to coffee ratio will result in a bland cup, and you'll miss some of the subtle sparkle of the top notes. Low acid means easy on the stomach, but it takes some care to coax the brightness out. I like it as a 'mixer'...most flavored K-cups are TOO flavored so I add a short cup of Tree Hugger, and it's just like the baby bear says...'this one is juuuuuuust right!'
3755	5	I have been using this for a few months and love the way it works. The scent is nice and it goes on smooth. I bought to use on my face and started using it on my chest and back. I've noticed that my skin is more clear than it's ever been.
3756	5	I will definitely order this again. It melts in your mouth. The texture is light. When I brought it to work, the whole bag disappeared in minutes.
3757	5	One of the best for our 11 year old Jack Russell mix.<br />I always check to make the first ingredient is meat or chicken, not a byproduct.
3758	1	Got this to try not realizing that the misleading photo on the package (vegetables, meats, grains) would NOT be used to make a premium dog food.  Reading the label, the first five ingredients disqualify it as any kind of premium anything!  They are: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E).  Um, where is the meat?  And ground yellow corn should NOT be the most plentiful ingredient.<br /><br />Giving this to a dog insures that not only will you be feeding the dog twice as much, but that he will poop an incredible amount.  The premium dog food that my dog now enjoys (Orijen Six Fish and Seafood) costs more, but I use half as much and he poops 1-2 times a day instead of every walk.<br /><br />Buy the better brands and be sure to check out the first five ingredients on any dog food before purchase.
3759	5	The plant was packaged very well and arrived in great condition. It even had a flower. Using the supplies and directions included in the package, I got the plant set up and it is looking good and healthy.
3760	1	These cookies are quite tasty. The ginger is there but it's subtle & not over-powering. The cookie is just a bit chewy, which is nice for texture.<br /><br />Although I could recommend the cookies on taste alone, I can't recommend them due to the condition in which they were received. The chocolate had melted & re-hardened at some point, perhaps more than once. The cookies were stuck together, and the chocolate was mis-formed. To make matters worse, the chocolate had bloomed & had the tell-tale signs of white. Chocolate bloom is characteristic of storing chocolate in warm conditions and of improperly tempering chocolate.<br /><br />Moreover, the manufacturer placed a batch sticker (050411) over the nutritional information on the back of the box. I attempted to peel back the sticker but still could not read nutritional information because the sticker did not come off. I have no idea how many calories are in the product, much less fat grams or fiber grams. Because the FDA required that nutritional facts are displayed on convenience foods sold in the US, a food manufacturer really should know better than to slap batch stickers over nutritional information. Likewise, Amazon should know better than to make improperly marked food products available for sale.<br /><br />I give these cookies 4* for the taste but took off 2* for condition. I took another 1* off for lack of nutritional information.<br /><br />Simply, I don't recommend.
3761	5	Great natural sweetner.  I use this in all of my drinks since I quit using all the synthetic sweetners that are so bad for you.
3762	5	I buy K-cups all the time and it was nice to buy a double pack for less money than I would have paid in the store. The breakfast blend is not a bold coffee. Being rather mellow and not bitter and with no after taste. If you are looking for a mild tasting coffee this would be a good choice.
3763	5	This tea is a wonderfully tasting tea.  It has a great aroma and lifts the spirits!  The price was good as well.
3764	5	By the smell of this one I was really iffy as to wether I would like it or not.<br />It smelled just like green bananas! Tart really strong smelling green bananas to the point of smelling like artificial banana flavoring. HOWEVER ... wait for it ... this stuff is AMAZING!<br /><br />Oh and also when I was mixing it my daughter asked  what is that??  as she had smelled it from the other room! I asked her  what does it smell like?  she answered  bananas !<br /><br />Okay no, I am not confused, I realize this is not banana matcha and in fact once you get it mixed it does not taste like banana matcha at all!<br /><br />This is yummy papaya! Like the passion fruit matcha I reviewed earlier today there is a rind like flavor to the matcha but its not quite as strong as the rind flavor was in the passion fruit, this is a very nice, fresh, ripe papaya tasting matcha and I LOVE IT! This is a very sweet tasting matcha too!<br /><br />Honestly, I never would have thought I would like this as much as I do based on the smell of the dry powder. Also this is one of the last matcha I have on hand that I have not yet tried or reviewed! Actually while I have not done my review yet on the brandy matcha I have had it and loved it. Just need to get the review done, so in fact, this is my last matcha to savor and oh yes I am savoring it!!<br /><br />I mixed this in my typical latte fashion and with the milk and creamer the flavors are incredible! I feel like I am drinking something on a cruise ship or at an island resort! The only thing missing is my lei and some island music! Gad this is for sure on my re-order list once this 30g is gone!
3765	5	This item was perfect for making waffles. The waffles had great flavor and nice color.  I like that it is organic. I will buy this product again.
3766	5	I recently bought an espresso maker  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002A3S66 >De'Longhi BAR32 Retro 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>  which I love, and wanted some good coffee to go with it.  Originally I was going to buy the illy espresso, but I saw this and it's cheaper and got great reviews, which are definitely well-deserved.  It's so delicious and I love the smell of the coffee - it's chocolaty.  MMMmmmmmmm.
3767	5	Better pricing than local pet store....easier to find.  They always run out and I cannot find them.  If the price holds I will continue to purchase on line from this vendor. shipping time was decent.<br />I like this vs rawhide - dog seems to choke on them less and they do not stink as bad when they are eating...she never leaves pieces and is always excited to receive.  Can't say the same about raw hide treats.
3768	3	Well I need to start off by saying the price offended me for a can that is a little bit bigger than the palm of your hand. Maybe as much as 4 inches in diameter and 2.5 Tall.<br />But the mix was excellent. lots of dried fruits, cashews and walnuts. No reall filler to this can as I expected with most  mixed Nuts  cans. All in all drop the price and I am happy to buy again.
3769	4	My pug comes running when he see's me filling up his bowl with this stuff. I really like it because since I started him on Wellness Supermix senior , his shedding has almost stopped , he is getting around much better (he's 13) and his is as slim and trim as he was as a teenager. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the Wellness has no oils in it to keep his skin moist. So if you buy this , be sure to add a few drops of Omega 3 oil to it or your dog may be scratching more from dry skin. It is a very healthy food for your dog. I plan on feeding any dog I ever get in the future this stuff.
3770	5	Its hard to improve on a classic, but Chips Ahoy does it well. These cookies are scrumptious, i had to bring them into work before i ate them all. They are a little difficult to dunk in milk as they are so soft and not to absorbant, but it is doable.. Again very tasty and definatly a good buy!
3771	4	In general, I am not a big fan of the recent  squeeze  drink concentrate fad. I have found most of them to have a slightly-off, artificial taste (one exception: Mio Sweet Tea). However, I find that  Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce  is the exception to the rule. Vitamin rich, it has a very pleasant taste that belies its sugar-free status.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to take the rating of this product down a notch for its packaging. It is extremely easy to dribble and leak if squeezed in the wrong manner, and the coloring is prone to staining. Also, the bottle size is larger than comparable drink products, such as Mio, meaning that it is not the most portable squeeze drink product around.<br /><br />In all,  Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce  is definitely worth picking up for its taste, which is pretty much the best I've had of its kind. Too bad about the packaging, though.
3772	5	Starbucks Veranda Blonde K-cup is a perfect thank-you gift for friends with a Keurig coffee maker!<br />Very satisfied with the level of service provided by AMZN.
3773	1	be warned, read the label<br />the candied citrus peel is only 4% and the raisin is 16.5%<br />meaning...<br />when you cut the expensive raisin bread open, don't expect it to look like the colorful picture.  It will be mostly blank yellow with raisins here and there.  There will be very very little citrus peel and they will all be orange and not green.<br /><br />The picture looks more like a dense fruit cake with dried cranberries, raisins and citrus peel in equal portions filling the inside with some green citrus peels here and there to add color.<br /><br />I happen to like raisin bread so it tasted fine to me, but I've also had the real thing with the citrus peels which looked similar to the picture at a party before, it looked presentable and tasted great and sadly this was not it.  Wish I had asked the host for the name of the brand before I bought this...
3774	5	Of all the flavors of tic tacs, these are my favorite.  Great wild cherry flavor. Love them!! Too bad they aren't more readily available to purchase locally.
3775	5	When I discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago, I was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten-free foods on the market. I have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me. Bisquick gluten-free pancake and baking mix is one of them. I use it every Sunday to make either pancakes or waffles. I recommend this mix whole-heartedly!
3776	5	I used to get this at a local major sporting goods store. They stopped carrying it. Thought it was gone forever until I decided to shop the web and here it was. I am a regular customer now getting it thru Amazon.
3777	5	There's not much one can say when reviewing water, but, this is refreshing water. It does have a nice, clear and clean taste. It's purified water with added electrolytes. It's very similiar in flavor to SmartWater. I'm not sure if the 9.5 PH level of Essentia is more than SmartWater. This water is a bit less expensive than SmartWater. I'd repurchase this. Though, I don't like the bottle design as much as I do SmartWater's bottle, it seems to get warmer faster in this type of bottle.
3778	5	these are so amazing, i have them on subscribe and save.  difficult to find any dried fruits that do NOT contain sulphites or sugar, and these DO NOT and are only sweetened with apple juice, not sugar.  even though they are dried, they are NOT dried OUT!  great to eat out of the resealable bag, or in stuffing and cereals.
3779	2	I received a package with 93 tea bags instead of 100.<br /><br />But tea is tasty. Stash company, please count better.
3780	4	I needed a half-caff coffee to use in my Keurig to get me thru the afternoon (but not keep me up all night).  This coffee does do the job.<br /><br />The only negative is a matter of my own taste.  I MUCH prefer dark roasted coffee, and this is definitely light-to-medium.  Tastes like Denny's coffee.  Just fine, not earth-shattering...<br /><br />My very favorite K-cup coffee is Obsidian (by Caribou) - to get a sense of what I wished it tasted like!
3781	5	I don't normally write reviews but for Orgain I felt compelled to. I can't stand most meal replacement shakes or protein shakes, because the texture usually seems off to me. When I have the time I use unflavored protein powder in a smoothie, but for days where that's just not possible Orgain has been an excellent substitute. I have tried chocolate and mocha, and both are great tasting. I prefer the mocha because I feel like I'm getting my coffee fix for the day--and though this stuff is caffiene free I feel energized without the jitters! It's a good breakfast, though occassionally I get an upset stomach after drinking it. I haven't been able to pinpoint why, but it's something to keep in mind if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />I also drink orgain on my workout days, half a shake beforehand and the other half afterward. Even though it's expensive, I don't drink it every day, and my monthly subscription for just a 12-pack has done me well for a while now. For me, it's worth the money to have meal replacement that is easy and tasty.
3782	5	Lovely flavour and taste, would buy it again anytime! Finished it in a short time. We used it as a sweetener or as a drink mixed with soda water.
3783	5	it's my favorite snack. Amazon has the best price ever for this.<br /><br />cheaper than korean grocery website and korean market.<br /><br />I'm gonna order again
3784	5	have picky allergy prone sensitive tummy ridgebacks, all of whom LOVE these treats. other reviews claim they are dry, but that's b/c there arent any additives. these are a mainstay in our pantry! we use the pumpkin/turkey and the sweet potato/turkey cookies. also love the salmon strips by plato.
3785	5	single serves or a little highter but to me worth it because i can make one cup at a time
3786	5	I thought these were very tasty, and I plan on picking some up at my next trip to the grocery store.  I don't know why these got so many bad reviews.  They were chewy, not hard, sweet, but not too sweet, and they have a decent amount of calories.  A lot of bars that you get that have chocolate on them, are about 140 to 150 calories.  These have 110 calories, and are 27 grams, which is pretty much the same size as most bars of this kind.  They don't have high fructose corn syrup, but they do have fructose and corn syrup, so that isn't a good thing.  These aren't natural as they are full of things you can't pronounce.  However, if you are looking for a sweet snack, these beat a candy bar any day.  The only thing I don't care for is that they don't leave me satisfied.  After eating one, I want another.  I find this is true with most chocolate granola bars though.  I agree with the other reviewers, I don't taste the peanut butter, I only taste the chocolate.<br /><br />I like to take these to work for my afternoon break, as that is when I crave a sweet treat, and these are much better than candy, as the calories are considerably lower.
3787	3	Gave this to my mother for her Doberman,  and Akkita/Shepard mix.  That said,  she has two large dogs.<br />So, they didn't like it at all,  and wouldn't touch it unless there wasn't  anything left in the house for them to eat,  Then they ate it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if they don't like this type,  flavor,  or brand,  or just aren't very fond of biscuits.  They don't seem to have too much of a problem with the milk bone brand biscuits.  Dogs are fussy,  it's really hard to find treats for dogs.<br /><br />Mine like chicken strips... And sweat potato sticks.  Greenies,  haven't really found much else.  Chicken flavor pup er ronie. Don't like beggan strips, love anything duck....  Does this give you a better idea of what my dogs taste buds are like?  Your dog may be different,  I dont know if you can really judge by what our dogs like.<br /><br />I'll rate it 3 stars since they ate it,  just not as a first option.
3788	5	The creamer singles are great to take along with you so that you are sure to have your favorite creamer on the go.  Service was prompt and very affordable pricing.  Love these!!!
3789	5	this is a great natural alternative to all the macaroni and cheese products that are on the market now. My kids love it and i can feel good about giving them a natural product without all the additives and dyes.
3790	4	Lapsang Souchong is definitely one of my absolute favorite teas.  I have tried both the Twinnings and Taylors of Harrogate brands of this tea and found the Taylors brand to be better in flavor and potency.  That being said, this product contains 300 teabags (that's a lot of tea!).  I would encourage tea adventurers to search your organic food stores to see if you can find smaller containers of lapsang souchong in order to try it before you buy.  The flavor is not difficult to get used to but may come as a shock to those used to other black teas.  That being said, my only issue with this product is the amount of tea contained within the order, which is enough to last for a year or more with moderate tea consumption.  If that's of no consequence to you, then I strongly urge you to buy this very delicious tea.  Enjoy.
3791	5	Our daughter put us on to coconut oil.  She said to make sure we got organic and extra virgin.  So we did via Amazon.  It's great because you can heat it up and it doesn't break down like olive oil.  Amazon's great because they have free shipping and discounts if you order on a 6-month basis.
3792	5	My husband is gluten intolerant and recently went completely gluten free. It has been hard but well worth it for both of us. I tried to make bread that was good, but was not succeeding. I finally ordered this for us and baked a loaf the day we received it. Like the person who posted photos, a larger loaf pan is a good idea because the bread gets huge after a while in the oven. Make sure when you cover it with aluminum foil you leave room or the foil will pretty much be floating lol. Anyway, this is the most.delicious.gluten.free.bread.EVER! I am not gluten intolerant, but I have cut back a lot on my gluten intake. Which leads me to conclude that gluten makes you fat, or at least helps make you fat! I am losing weight without trying!<br />We use Bob's brown rice flour and sorghum flour. Love it too!<br />If I had to hate anything about this bread it'd be the smell when you are preparing it. But thank goodness there is no trace of that in the baked bread. I was worried about it having a  bean flavor  like others mentioned. If you ask me this tastes very very close to regular wheat bread. There's no gross texture, flavor or dryness, like other gluten free breads seem to have.
3793	4	I eat these on a daily basis, they're that good. I can go weeks of having one or two a day until I start getting burned out, and after a couple of days I'm always ready for another. Special K meal bars have just the kick to last those extra two hours at the end of the day, or replace a junky fast-food breakfast. I feel like I've had a lot less problems with fatigue and stress since I've started keeping one handy all the time; when I start to get tired and grouchy I pop one open, get a short jog around the building, and I'm good to go. I go through about 2-3 boxes a month. After hundreds of bars I'd say the taste and texture could be improved just a little, but they're the only bar I've liked so much, while costing so little, that I eat it constantly. Never had a stale one. Get the subscription, it's so worth it.
3794	5	I got this for my husband but my grandkids love it also.  The small bags are the perfect size for kids and adults alike.  When I make a sandwhich it's easy to add a bag on the side by the sandwhich to make the perfect lunch.  These are good to have if you've got lots of kids to feed a quick snack to.
3795	2	I was first disappointed to read the ingredient list and find chemical names that I don't even recognize.  It wasn't horrible, but I'd rather have a more pure product.<br /><br />I popped a handful in my mouth and at first thought the flavor was good, but very quickly came a bitter or stale after-taste.<br /><br />Definitely not something I'd recommend.  We'll be tossing these out for the birds and the squirrels.
3796	5	Love this snack.<br />Its really tasty.<br />Filling for my wife, not me though... I'll take 2 please  =)
3797	5	My nine month old son loves these in all flavors -- original, vegetable, and strawberry.  They are easy for him to hold and bite; and they dissolve easily in his mouth.  The strawberry flavor is much sweeter than the others.  He started with the Baby crackers at about 6 months and recently switched to the the toddler variety, but there is actually very little difference in the texture.
3798	5	I really enjoyed my first batch of Kim Chee using Noh of Hawaii Kim Chee Mix. It comes with instructions. I watched some youtube videos of others making Kim Chee which were helpful.<br /><br />I used one Napa Cabbage, half a cucumber (peeled) and half a bunch of green onions with one package mix; soaked for 8 hours at least in brine. I sliced everything into bite sized amounts.<br /><br />Then I rinsed the produce and drained it. I mixed up the mix with water and poured it onto my cut produce. It covered everything with with the sauce.<br /><br />I let it sit and ferment. I like the flavor very much. It is hot and spicy; just enough to be delightful.<br /><br />I already have a second batch fermenting now.<br /><br />September.24.2011 update:<br />I've really enjoyed Kim Chee made with the Noh of Hawaii seasoning mix. I've experimented with adding more produce and now I make larger batches of Kim Chee so that I need to use two packages of Kim Chee for the following:<br /><br />1 Napa Cabbage (large),<br />1 bunch of green onions<br />1 carrot,<br />1 cucumber.<br />1/2 leek.<br />3 Jalepeno Peppers.<br /> Diakon Radish 1/2 lbs.<br /><br />I clean, rinse off everything and slice it up into bite sizes. Then I soak the cut produce in brine. Finally I rinse it three times before mixing in the seasoning mix with fresh water.<br /><br />I like the flavor a lot more with all the above ingredients in it. It is full of flavor with interesting textures and looks.
3799	5	Absolutely delicious, savory pasta sauces...I tried all flavors in these handy, easy to store pouches.  If you want savory, this tomato basil is outstanding.  If spicy is your thing, try the spicy Fra Diavlo!  Too yummy and easy to dress up or down.  I ordered 3 cases of each!
3800	1	This stuff is terrible. I have no idea how they consider this to be bacon flavored. It's vaguely mayonnaise-flavored, and slightly fishy. No other flavors are discernible. The fact that it's KOSHER should have tipped me off, but no, I decided to hope for the best. I'm sorely disappointed. I bought the jar, and I'm going to FINISH the jar, but this is not bacon flavored at all, and highly inferior to run-of-the-mill mayonnaise. As far as I can tell from the label, the  bacon flavor  is nothing more than liquid smoke. Every inch of this is false advertising. And while I'm at it, the J&D bacon salt? Kinda barbecue-y, and not bad on fries/tots, but again, not even a hint of bacon to be found.<br /><br />Long story short? Use mayonnaise, J&D has no idea what bacon is.
3801	5	Arrived fast!  Great product.  Exactly as stated.  Would buy this again and probably will when I need more blooms and my own plants let me down.  Perfectly preserved!
3802	2	This is for the hardier consumer, taste wise. If you don't mind the flavor of powdered peas, this one is for you. Good texture, good dissolvability. Price is what you would expect--no bargain but not a killer. There is, however, most definitely the flavor of peas there, and nothing really covers it up. I like peas when they are green and I have to chase them around on my plate. In the form of a vanilla, or chocolate, or coffee, or banana, or blackberry, etc., etc. drink?--naw.
3803	3	These are hardly deluxe or whole, I was expecting larger and more whole cashews.  Good price still as i just fire these things down by the handfull....salt is a little messy but nice.
3804	5	At first I was highly skeptical.  I mean, come on.  Tofu in a box?!?  It must be loaded with tons of preservatives, etc.  However, my roommate swears by the stuff.  After seeing my roommate using it in a variety of ways, I was curious, and finally one day, I picked up a box.<br /><br />I can't believe it's preservative-free!  And it tastes great!  (or more exact, it has no taste --par for course for tofu).  The texture is just like the regular silken stuff.<br /><br />Also, I'm full after consuming a box of tofu (female, 140 lbs), which is only 120 calories!!!  Good for weight loss/control.<br /><br />Ordering the case is super-convenient.  I order it to my office and keep a bottle of ponzu sauce (soy sauce with citrus lemon) at the office.  When I want a quick lunch or pick-me-up snack, I just make myself one that is healthy.<br /><br />The product is also very versatile.  Similar to my roommate, I use it in tofu scrambles (tofu instead of eggs), tofu shakes (fruit, juice, tofu), and miso soup (by the miso base from Japanese or Korean market from the fridge section, comes in 4 x4  cube container..only scoop out what you need and refrigerate the rest).  There is also tons of books out there on how to innovatively use tofu (has tons of non-Asian recipes).<br /><br />bon apetit!
3805	5	One day my husband came home with this little bottle of spice....Okay, says I...I'll try it.  All I can say is Wow! It has been a couple of years now, and I am STILL not bored with it. It is still my favorite spice to reach for. My favorite combo being a dash of celtic sea salt, and a big shake of Bragg Sprinkles!<br /><br />The grind size is just right...not so fine that it is like tiny  sand . Rather, it's just large enough that you can actually get little tastes of various flavors....rosemary, thyme, sweet basil, a smidge of dill, oregano, etc. Even though it contains about 25 different spices, it doesn't blend away to  anonymous  when it hits your mouth. You're gonna love it!<br /><br />Oh, and we usually have it right on the table, for that last sprinkle on top, right before we eat it. Mmmmmmmmmm.
3806	4	These are semi-thin, crunchy cookies with dried blueberries mixed in.<br /><br />The good:<br />I loved the packaging and the fact that I could keep the contents fresh with the folding wire.<br />I appreciate the lack of corn syrup and the whole grain %.<br />They are low in sugar and even have some iron.<br />I love that they have no cholesterol.<br />My husband and son really liked their taste (very important to know when one craves junk food and the other has high cholesterol).<br /><br />The negative:<br />I thought these would have a new kind of taste but they don't.<br />Each cookie is about 45 calories.<br />The fat content is quite high (8%).<br />I didn't like the taste much.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Not for me, but if I am filling up the pantry with food for others to snack on, I will definitely pick these over other cookies.
3807	4	I absolutely love illy coffee ever since I had it in JFK airport.  It is so smooth with no bitter taste at the end.  Very rich coffee like they have in Europe.  However, the flavor of the blue label/medium roast had a better flavor to me.  I thought I would like dark roast better, but medium was more my taste.  That's all.
3808	5	I have tried so many different bars (Kashi, Cascadian farms, others), but I have never had a better bar than this! It is great, not too sweet (a big deal for me) snack. It is also organic - what not to like?
3809	4	This is by far the best K-cup coffee I have tasted. Has a big bold taste with lots of flavor. Unfortunately the price is too high so will only buy on special occasions.
3810	5	I got a sample of these crackers in the mail and from first taste I was hooked. My husband loves these crackers too. I can not find them in my local stores so I order them from Amazon. They are more expensive than similar crackers but I like them more so it evens out. These taste like goldfish crackers only better and they are all natural.
3811	5	This product is excellent for so many things.  Soup on a cold day, add veggies or meat.  It's just right.
3812	5	We switched to this dog food after our 12 yr old mixed breed dog started losing weight and developed severe dermatitis, itching, scratching and shedding! For 12 yrs, we had been giving her a name brand dry product we purchased at local pet stores.  She is a completely different dog these days!  She has gained back all her weight, is happy, and does not itch,scratch or shed.  I HIGHLY recommend this dog food!  It is made of natural, good ingredients.
3813	5	This is a wonderful product, at a wonderful price.  I am so hooked on the stacy's pita chips, and this is a great buy.
3814	3	Pretty Good but I had to buy a lot of them and I got tired of the taste after about 2 packs so I would not purchase it again, I still have enough to last for years if I only use 2 or 3 a year.
3815	5	My 3 1/2 month old kitten Sadie just loves this food.  She has lots of energy and none of the bloat that other foods gave my other cats.  I would recommend this food for anyone with kittens.
3816	2	The product was cheap, so I bought a pack to try. Wasn't the greatest beef jerky but not the worst for massed produced jerky.<br />Beef jerky is cut too thick for my liking, flavor wasn't really sweet or spicy.
3817	5	This is the ONLY brand that I will eat.  Of course, they have tried to feed me a ZILLION different brands and flavors, but this is what I started with & this is the brand I am sticking to.  Don't even try to pass me anything else.
3818	5	I love these chips.  They're crunchy, slightly sweet & salty, and really delicious.  I love that they're gluten free (because I wouldn't eat them otherwise) and free of a lot of other things too.  They have a great flavor!
3819	5	I have always thought that Turkish pistachio nuts were better than the California ones. These are what many of us grew up with, even though we didn't know it. California ones are great. They are larger, sweeter, meatier. But the Turkish ones have a wonderful taste anda texture. There are only two problems, other than the addictive part: they are so expensive and hard to find.
3820	1	$4 a bottle, they must be kidding!<br /><br />You can get this for $2.50 to $3.00 at any<br />convenience store and they are hardly known<br />for low prices.<br /><br />You would have to be brain damaged to pay<br />these prices!
3821	4	great tasting molasses I like this product a lot but the packaging was very poor,<br />the bottles leaking. please improve your shipping & handling.
3822	1	I love the Cappucinos and Lattes Gevalia makes for my Tassimo so I thought I'd try the Hot Chocolate, too.  It's as easy to make as the Cappuccinos and Lattes, but I really didn't care for the taste of this Hot Chocolate.  But this is just a personal preference
3823	5	This bite-size cookie is unbelievably delicious with a chewy texture and a super rich, fudgy flavor.
3824	4	This is a great coffee....I have been tasting many different brands....this one is rich, bold, and delicious!<br /><br />I highly recommend this coffee, it's a nice get up and go blend.
3825	5	I really like the flavor of these coffee pods.  I have the pod holder for my kuerig machine and these are one of my favorites.  Has a lot of flavor and the price is far cheaper than kuerig cups. Would recommend.
3826	5	SO glad that I found something that is healthy and yummy for my puppy. She gobbles them up whenever I give them to her.
3827	5	This year we ordered these dark chocolates and also bought a package of dark chocolates from Godiva. The Godiva dark chocolate box is $36 for 10.5 oz. (really, it's on their website). These are the same price for a full pound. And they come from Belgium, where people are very fussy about chocolates, and proud of their chocolates. It is not just the price. The taste difference is amazing. These are the real thing, a pleasure from first to last. We lived in France, where chocolate shops abound, and Leonidas was quite competitive against the artisan shops.
3828	5	I used to buy this when I lived in Maine years ago and it goes great with homemade baked beans.  I live in the midwest now and had forgotten about it until I saw an advertisement somewhere a few months ago.  My husband loves molasses and I thought that he'd really enjoy this unique bread.  I was right - he loves it.  We have 4 cans left, but he wants me to go ahead and order more. I'm wondering why they don't sell this nationally as it is so tasty.  I don't remember it costing so much when I lived out East and the next time we're out that way I'm going to buy barrels of it!
3829	2	These individual nutella packets are going to be great for school lunches, but I was very disappointed with how they arrived.  I expected them to come in a case like the one pictured, and instead received them crammed into a flat rate mailing envelope, with several of the packets squashed.  I was charged 10.88 in shipping fees.  Not cool.
3830	5	We have two shelties and their breath improved almost immediately with this product.  One of our dogs has a problem digesting another brand, but neither dog had a problem with the Greenies.  Highly Recommend.
3831	5	It's awesome tasting just like any mainstream kind with the taste of berries to boot. A real gem!
3832	5	We love this flavor of tea and cannot find it in stores.  These large tea bags make more than one cup of tea.
3833	1	Just bought and tried COCO LIBRE coconut water. After reading the label, I see that it is from a concentrate and uses unknown  natural  flavors.  So, we would want to know the process for concentration, in what kind of storage container is was shipped in, at what tempurature, for how many days and what kind of water was used to reconstitute it. I don't think the advertising makes any of this clear.
3834	5	This tea is herbal, but tastes like a smooth regular tea.  Makes great hot tea or cold tea.  I especially like it hot with a teaspoon of honey-mmm delicious.  It also seems to be a natural diuretic, so especially nice when you feel like you've got a little extra fluid.  Don't drink it right before bed, or you'll be getting up during the night.  This is my favorite tea.
3835	5	My Kitties(Tuffy and Silki) LOVE this stuff. They will eat other food they are less fond of if I put a tablespoon of this on it. It's got to be the all time fave!
3836	5	I love coffee, especially Italian espresso, freshly made..and with this coffee, you can have such a good coffee at home. Smells good, taste is strong but smooth and it makes this nice coffee foam..just perfect. I will hardly ever buy different one.
3837	4	For a convenient tea in a teabag, this is a good buy, largely due to a lack of bagged white tea availability in most locales.  White tea is believed to be even more beneficial than green tea in some ways, and can have quite a bit less caffeine then green or black if the tea is immature enough.<br /><br />For most of this year, I have been using bulk teas (silver needles and rooibos) with a Swissgold infuser--all purchased from Amazon.  I now notice the paper taste on normal teas I once thought were perfectly fine.  That said, the flavor from the paper in this tea is not too bad, and thankfully, the floral-fruity tea flavor comes out okay.  The bag uses unbleached filter paper and the tea is organic.<br /><br />I find a sweetener and a brewing temperature under 180 degrees helps this tea.  Another reviewer stated this white tea produces a darker tea, and I definitely find this to be true.<br /><br />As with Silver Needles, I find I can focus better on work or study.  This effect starts within twenty minutes of drinking.  However, Silver Needles seems to produce no jittery  caffeine  effect while this one can a bit.  I have had other white peony teas that have no caffeine  jittery-effect , but these are ones I've had at good cafes, and they were bulk, but pricier teas.<br /><br />A higher-grade, better tasting white tea, Silver Needles, is also available on Amazon.  We get the Davidson's Tea Silver Needles in bulk.  If you are looking for a pure white tea with no flavorings of any sort, this White Peony and the Davidson's are the two to try.<br /><br />The Davidson's Tea Silver Needles is here:<br /><br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SANUEK >Davidson's Tea Bulk, Silver Needles, 16-Ounce Bag</a>
3838	4	These made very tasty cupcakes.  The directions say to fill up the paper cups to the top, but I would not recommend that.  I came close to the top filling 12 cups,and the cupcakes  overflowed  and stuck to one another.  They still tasted great, but didn't look as great as they could.<br /><br />I also wish the box mix would make a full recipe of Ina's cupcakes like other box mixes.  It says it only makes 10.  I did get 12, and probably could have gotten 14 out of the mix, but I would have liked to make 18-24 like her from-scratch recipe.<br /><br />Finally, I wish they would put directions for making a full cake.  I tried one box mix to make 2 9  circles, but they were too thin because it really only is a 1/2 recipe -- something I didn't realize until after the cake attempts.
3839	5	I really enjoy the delicate flavor of this tea and it has a very pleasant scent. Makes morning wake up delightful and mid-afternoon break quite soothing especially on a stressful day. As it contains ginger, it does double-duty on my tummy (I have IBS). I highly recommend this.
3840	5	This is the third box of the Island Coconut coffee I have purchased.  it is a medium roast coffee with more than a hint of coconut that comes out in every sip.  It also has other nutty flavors.  Out of all the flavors I have tried (a bunch) this is my favorite flavor, but I love coconut.  I don't like very strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee so this is roast is perfect for me.
3841	5	I never bother to write reviews but I am SO SAD that Amazon doesn't carry these cookies anymore that i had to write a eulogy.  I had these on subscribe and save and was ordering about 3 cases a month.  My husband is English and we drink a lot of tea in this house and there is seriously no better tea cookie.  These cookies are pretty good dry, but dunked in a hot cup of milky tea they are total heaven.  Since Amazon isn't carrying them anymore I am going to have to figure out another way to get my fix.
3842	4	This sauce has a good delicately balanced flavor, I can understand why it is a favorite sauce among it's fans.  The flavor is balanced with no one particular one ingredient taking over.  It is a farily simple hot sauce flavor profile with vinegar, garlic and onion boosted with citrus to make it interesting.<br /><br />I have to admit, it was not quite as hot as I was expecting after seeing it had both habaneros and pepper extract in the ingredients, and from the many warnings on the label about how dangerously hot it was.  Don't be fooled though, this is still a very, very hot sauce.  I have had other sauces without extracts that were as hot as this which is the only reason I bring this up.  I suppose it could be possible the batch I got was weak for some reason and I did not get a typical sample.<br /><br />This is a good sauce, I would recommend it to others.
3843	5	This puppy food is excellent!  It is very high quality.  The price is a bit higher than even some of the other super premium dog foods but it's well worth it!
3844	5	With this sauce, what you get is solid, wonderful flavor. The heat is not important here(even though there's plenty of it for the general population), the flavor is the star of the show.<br /><br />Most foods will mask the hotness, but the flavor complements everything, from wings to pizza to burgers. This is a very, VERY good thing, because you'll want to pour this wonderful substance on EVERYTHING. Do yourself a favor and buy the 12oz bottle, because the 5oz bottle won't last a week.
3845	5	Great candy.  The shell was hard with a soft center like they were supposed to be.  Good flavor too.
3846	1	THIS PRODUCT WAS SENT WITH A SHORT SHELF LIFE AND I FELT IT WAS SNEAKY AND UNDER-HANDED, WON'T PURCHASE FROM THEM EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!
3847	4	This coffee is absolutely amazing. Don't get a BLEND do not, do not buy a blend. You're not getting the real thing. I've tried this through the coffee pot (using permanent gold filter) and through french press and it's absolutely wonderful. Sweet, nutty, fruity, everything it's made out to be. worth every penny. Such a wonderful cup of coffee. I usually like mine with cream and sugar and with this cup I didn't need either. Try it black with a small amount of sugar. Excellent. Someone suggested cutting this coffee with Kona. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This coffee doesn't need to be cut by anything. It stands up on its own and if your friends didn't notice any difference in the coffee they were driking you either a) made it wrong, or b) have friends with little to no taste buds.
3848	3	I get these figs from my local Walmart (can't recall price but, well under $10).  They are a good substitute for the actual dry figs that I got used to but, can no longer find ANYWHERE!.  These are moist and mushy like prunes.  I prefer the dried (actual dry) figs that are chewy and flavorful (not that these don't have flavor but, the mushyness is kinda gross).  I leave the bag open to try to let them dry out a bit.  My 7 year old daughter feels exactly the same way!  I am ordering some of the dry ones on-line in hopes that they are like those I previously purchased at two different stores in the area that no longer carry them.
3849	5	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006U7SVI >Real Meat Chicken & Venison Jerky Dog Treats</a> Gracie was blase about her treats until I started these.  When I bring these out she dances.  I love to see a happy dog!
3850	5	I like a more robust flavored coffee and try a few different ones. This Tullys Italian Roast consistently delivers. The breakfast blend and French Roast is also a good choice. If it is too strong you an always choose a larger cup size on your brewer. The taste is comparable to what I would purchase out shopping for a nice pick me up.
3851	3	I like the fact that it is organic but the spiciness is not there.  I perfer the Sagion cinnamon because of its flavor.  This cinnamon is mildly spicy.
3852	4	AS others have said, this cereal is pretty tasty. I like the flavor, although the cereal is pretty crunchy (hard).<br /><br />Despite the good flavor and other positives, BE WARNED!<br /><br />Do not eat this cereal for breakfast if later that day you are:<br />-going on a hot date<br />-having a business meeting<br />-meeting the in-laws for the first time<br />-giving a presentation in front of any number of people<br />-going on a long road trip with other people<br /><br />This cereal is better saved for days when you plan on being a solitary hermit....or are spending the day with someone that doesn't mind (or is highly amused by) explosive flatulence! Holy cow! I bought the 4-pack of these cereal from Amazon several months ago, and I could NOT for the life of me figure out why I've been having such tremendous farts! My long-term boyfriend was initially amused by the frequency and volume of my trumpeting (farts that literally lasted 30 seconds or more), but it's since just become something for him to grimace at. Notably, I ate this for breakfast the morning on the day he proposed to me....Let me just say that our hotel stay that day was less than romantic. Hilariously awful, but not romantic.<br /><br />So, this cereal has its purposes. Despite being a 26 year old woman, fart humor is still a blast (pun!) to me. I might buy it again (I just finished the last box), but I'll just be selective on when to eat it. A Google search for  Kashi gas  reveals that I'm not alone in this.
3853	5	The treats are soft and smell meaty.  Not a smell that appeals to me but then I'm not the one eating them.  My cat loves them :)  I give him 1 each morning!  Well worth the money since he rejects the different flavors of greenies cat treats i've tried to give him!
3854	3	Thats right, the 'ultimate hippy corn ships' are not made with organic corn which means it is most likely it's made with GMO corn. Not cool and amazingly they have never used organic corn. Why not? Most of the other health food type chips have always used organic corn. Why not the one with the hippy label? No excuses, I'd rather pay an extra 50 cents and get it right.
3855	5	I have a very picky 7 month-old baby girl who LOVES this baby foods. This particular one. I first bought them when my local grocery store ran a buy-one-get-one free special on Sprout baby foods. I bought one of each and found out my baby loved this one the best so I went and got some more. Now this is the only thing she likes to eat.<br /><br />I wish they came in jars but this doesn't stop me from buying them. My baby loves, loves, loves this flavor.
3856	5	Wow, my cats just love these, especially the Chicken Pot Pie variety.  They also gobble up the Chinese Chicken (now renamed to Sesame Chicken), but the Chicken Pot Pie is their all-time fave.  I enjoy feeding my cats food that they like as long as it's healthy, and Petite Cuisine is.  It's  real  food (no meat by-products) and there aren't any added dyes or preservatives.
3857	5	Tully's coffee is the smoothest coffee on the market. The Kona blend is our favorite. The price is well worth the enjoyment we have with every delicious cup!
3858	5	Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as lime 'n chili, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts. A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want.
3859	5	I am not the type that ever writes reviews, especially for the internet, but Pop Chips are the best   potato chips  that I have ever had -- so much so that I have to limit myself to one bag per week!  A friend introduced Pop Chips to me and I immediately told her that I hated her because they are so good, they are irrisistable.  I purchased a box of 12 to be delivered every three months so that I can limit myself to one bag per week ... otherwise, I would absolutely be in trouble.<br /><br />Believe me, you have to try these chips!
3860	5	These beans arrived quickly and the quality was fantastic!  The beans were moist and easy to use.  The flavor was amazing and I will definately be ordering these beans again.
3861	5	I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!
3862	5	Discovered these at M.O.M.'s (My Organic Market) in Maryland. They came in large bags and the taste and texture really grew on me, so I checkd on Amazon and voila, small bags, bought a case, I am a happy camper!
3863	5	I recently had the opportunity to try the Fog Chaser blend and loved it. Bought this based on that positive experience. The K-cups are quite novel - the base is a filter instead of plastic and they work GREAT.The Rainforest expresso blend is also quite nice. Try the breakfast blend for a little lighter roast.
3864	5	Calm has lived up to its name.  In fact it has also helped my son with his muscle twitches.  I highly recommend trying it for anxiety and muscle issues.  And by purchasing it online I saved almost a huge amount of money!
3865	1	I've championed a number of Rishi's Chinese teas (and their chais) because they're excellent. This, unfortunately, was my introduction to Wu Yi oolongs many moons ago. Had I not looked farther, I'd have dismissed the entire category.<br />Wu Yi  rock  oolongs are processed from bushes that thrive in mineral-rich soil. They tend to be on the  dark  side, i.e., rather highly oxidized. The best of them are sublime; however, that's not to say that there aren't good rock oolongs to be found that won't require that you refinance your home.<br />In general, though, you get what you pay for. I trusted my previous experiences with Rishi, plus their description of this one's profile sounded right up my alley (someone over there writes very good copy). At the price, I figured that I couldn't go wrong.<br />I was in error.<br />The only thing I taste in this tea is smoke; it tastes like the leavings of a campfire. This is fine for a Lapsang red tea, but it's totally out of place in an oolong. Quite frankly, this is the worst  specialty  tea I've ever bought, and I don't believe it's due to a mere matter of taste--it's just bad, like Liquid Smoke. The fact that it's organic in no way compensates for the fact that it's almost undrinkable.<br />I wasn't going to review this tea given that  if you can't say anything nice, ...,  etc. However, Amazon made the point of recommending this to me, so I felt I had to set the record straight. Bottom line: look elsewhere to become acquainted with Wu Yi oolongs...unless you're a pretentious Finnish ugly-boy stalker-troll with liver-lips, of course.
3866	5	My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year.
3867	5	i bought three of these for my children as gifts - two of them use it - and i have adopted the unused one for me.  it is very helpful with calming yourself and letting go of stress.
3868	4	I bought these pumps to use wtih teh Torani syrups.  They fit the bottles perfectly and are quite durable. They are really easy to clean and they seem to rarely clog.<br />Not to mention the very reasonable price! I would recommend this product.
3869	5	I concur with many of the other reviewers that this makes a delicious cup of tea.  It's also very well packaged: a thick, well sealed bag that you can store in the nice airtight tin once it's opened.  Quality all round.<br /><br />I also agree, though, that the brewing instructions on the tin are very wrong.  They say to use a tablespoon for one 8oz cup, and brew for 3-4 minutes.  That's way too much.  I tend to brew a 36oz pot, and for that I use about 1 1/2 teaspoons brewed for around 2 minutes (you can use the leaves a second or even a third time though, as they say).  The flavour is supposed to be delicate, not blow your socks off, but even using that quantity of tea produces a very tasty and aromatic brew.  And this comes from someone who likes black tea made strong enough to stand your spoon up in it.<br /><br />Similar products from other sellers give brewing instructions much closer to mine, so I can only assume that the instructions on these were simply an error (or they want everyone to burn through a tin in a few days).
3870	5	I bought these for my sister-in-law who has celiac disease and added chocolate chips and walnuts to the mix.  She and everyone in the family loved these cookies.  You could not tell that they were gluten free at all.  I did let them cook longer so that they would come out crispy instead of chewy.  Would definitely buy this mix again since inside the box comes different recipes you could make with this mix.
3871	5	When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the  nuggets in gravy  style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being.
3872	5	I got the pineapple one for my husband, because it's his favorite gummi flavor as well as gummi bears being one of his favorite candies. He loved it, and it was enough to get him excited, but not so much that he O.D.'d on it, and couldn't finish it or look at another gummi bear ever again. It might start to be a Christmas tradition for him now.
3873	1	This is labeled:  Great River Organic Milling 100% Organic Bread Flour Unbleached Wheat <br />This I evidently mistook to be ordinary bread flour made from wheat. What I got was 20 pounds of Whole Wheat Flour which I have no need for and can not return.<br /><br />The label should have read: Unbleached Whole Wheat Bread Flour.
3874	4	Sometimes you want a refreshing change to plain water, and this does the trick.  I could imagine adding a splash of gin or vodka on days you sort of want to be bad (smile).
3875	5	If you like a light-flavored coffee, you will probably go for this one for convenience as well as flavor.<br /><br />It is in coffee bags (like tea bags) so you never need to make more than one cup at a time.  The bags are round, which makes it steep better than square bags.  There is no string on the bags to leach coffee from the cup onto the surface where you are steeping it.<br /><br />I shared this with friends.  Upon opening the packaging for the bag, every single one commented on the wonderful smell.  All those who liked a mild coffee described the flavor as SMOOOOOOTH.
3876	1	I oredered when the price was 4.99. But they cancelled my order without reason and any explanation.<br /><br />The price was 4.99 few days ago and Now They changed for 18.46.<br /><br />First e-mail   They were back ordered ...and Second e-mail  they will ship one month later <br />and finally they e-mail me that<br /> your order has been canceled. Your credit card was not charged for this order. If you're still interested in this item, please search for it again on Amazon.com. <br /><br />Obviously, They have stocks(They sell).... And what is the reason?  No trust!
3877	2	The toy is sturdy and well constructed but my Havanese puppy took no time at all to figure out the three games.  Certainly not a brain teaser.  Because there are small pieces the owner must be involved in the game to be sure a puppy doesn't eat them.  My dog much prefers the ball with treats inside that fall out as he noses it around and so do I as it keeps him independently amused for at least 15 minutes.
3878	5	I had a skunk take up residence behind my garage.  Threw down about a third of the can and in just a day or two, Mr. Skunk had moved on.
3879	5	The Tug-A-Jug seems to have really gotten a hold of both my dogs from day one, and so far there's no sign of them letting up...even at night sometimes...alas.  Seems to be solidly-built.  They've taken it outside as well.  I may order a second one so they will stop fighting over it.
3880	5	Very closely resembles a Triscuit cracker...except there is no soy!  (And a bit lighter.)<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with the taste and texture, it is a quality cracker.<br /><br />Enjoy.
3881	5	They look good and they smell good and my very picky German shepherd loves them as well. I will be buying these in the future and her poops are great! My dog and I LOVE them!!!
3882	4	Well, it's not exactly what you'd consider the epitome of culinary delights, but then again, Harry Potter isn't exactly the normal boy either.  If you've read the books and wondered exactly what it is that the world of wizardry chooses for snack time, this has to be pretty darn close if not spot on.  I wouldn't choose to eat a ton of these, but they're great for Potter parties and the like.  I would suggest looking at the Jelly Belly website as well.  They have some better deals on price, but depending on what else you order, shipping may exceed the savings.  I recommend the crispy frogs, too.  And careful when you open the package - they may jump!
3883	5	This is a full-bodied tea with ginger. It's substantial and satisfying--a great coffee substitute. I definitely will be re-ordering this tea. It's flavor is absolutely unique.
3884	5	I use a pinch an meats when I grill or broil. Love the alder wood taste of this salt, broil indoors and get a rick smoked flavor. A little goes a long way!
3885	5	Oh, these are so good, and good for you too!  Even if you hate  snack  bars, you'll probably love these.  The challenge will be in eating just one--in my house they tend to get eaten several times a day until they're gone.  It's the lasagna of the snack world.
3886	5	these are very hard to find in chicagoland.  old family recipe for matza ball soup.  have to have them.
3887	4	Many chocolate flavored coffees tend to leave a unique 'fake' aftertaste.  This Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut K-cups are no exception, if brewed hot.  For some reason when this coffee is brewed as an iced coffee (either directly into ice or placed in freezer for 20 minutes after brewing), this weird flavor goes away.  It is a great summer iced coffee drink.
3888	5	My daughter has celiac and has been complaining that the only thing she really misses is ravioli.  I hadn't been able to find any in my local stores-- so thanks amazon !!!  It arrived in a cooler pack, still frozen.  My daughter had it for dinner tonite and was so happy-- she loved it.  Worth every penny !
3889	5	Purchased for my wife the vegan. She loves this product and uses for shakes or sprinkles on her hot cereal in the morning. She has me order more as soon as she starts getting low. On the flip side if you are a  meat & taters  person like myself it is an acquired taste as I don't like it much. In a nutshell....<br />Vegans & Veggie lovers = GOOD!!<br />Junk food Junkies = You could use some help
3890	4	It isn't made well enough to last a lot of dog abuse however. If you have a dog that plays more gently with it's toys, you'll love it too.
3891	4	So now I feel so warm and fuzzy on the inside since there is less plastic being used. However, once you break open the inner plastic packaging that holds the kcups, you now have to store them in a jar so they stay fresh.
3892	5	It seems like I am always sampling new coffee for my K-cup brewer, but for consistent good taste this is one of the best. It makes a quality cup of coffee with real coffee taste.
3893	5	This is a great espresso, and amazon has the BEST price out there!  I can't drink hot coffee in the summer, so I have started brewing this the night before.  I make about 4 double shots, but brew it more like an americano - into a small pyrex cup.  Then I allow it to cool, pour it into a container with a little ice, and the next morning, voila - Iced Americano as soon as I wake up without having to mess with the espresso machine.  I have tried other brands, Illy, Fresh and Easy, but this is my favorite and the price is right.
3894	5	I purchased a smaller quantity of this espresso at a local retailer, and have been prepariing it in a regular coffee maker.  To my astonishment and delight, there's not a hint of bitterness to this highly caffeinated libation.  Make no mistake, this is a STRONG cup of joe, but very pleasing to the palate and well worth the price.<br /><br />For those of you who need the morning perk but like it sweet, try this:<br /><br />8 oz brewed Lavazza<br /><br />4 oz very warm milk<br /><br />2 tablespoons Ghirardelli White Chocolate Mocha<br /><br />Blend the milk and the white chocolate together FIRST, then pour and blend the mixture into the coffee.  This has salvaged more than one otherwise miserable commute for me!
3895	4	Got this instead of another more expensive jalapeno powder. Works great! Husband likes it on popcorn and I use it to make hot and spicy pretzels.
3896	1	My title says it all. The first ingredient reads,  Organic corn syrup solids,... <br /><br />This product is shamefully unhealthy. Even our dog's food doesn't have corn products.<br /><br />Check out the research on how corn does not metabolize and the effects on the brain by consuming an  excitotoxin  like corn.<br /><br />The little one is healthier to have breast milk vs such a desperate and compromising alternative.<br /><br />Excitotoxins:<br />[...]Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]
3897	2	This is NOT food. Not for humans at least. Maybe a quasi-meat-flavored alternative to Ex-Lax. If you're lucky, you will only be spewing orange sludge from one bodily orifice at a time after you eat one of these. Shiva step aside if you eat more than that. On a positive note, my dog really likes them, so I give this two stars.
3898	5	If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!
3899	2	I'm going to give the sellers time to respond.  Maybe they made a mistake.  But according to the label.  I received this Product on May 14, 2012 and it expires on June 11, 2012.
3900	5	We get a shipment of this regularly, because we MUST be well-stocked at all times.<br /><br />It has a deep, rich flavor with complex notes. The acidity is low, and while the beans are oily, it's in just the right way.<br /><br />I have yet to find a burnt bean, as well! You can tell there is some love and care that goes into the roasting of these beans.<br /><br />We will buy these beans for as long as they continue roasting them!
3901	5	The pink color is very nice and bright. I made some candy hearts and they came beautifull. I also used it for cake pops but it have to be mixed with a little amount of paramount crystals to be liquid enough for coating the cake pops. It's liquids much better than Wilton's.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008DI8OY >Paramount Crystals</a>
3902	5	This is the best hot cereal Ive had, its all they say it is. The only complaint is that it is quite expensive for what you get. As long as that doesnt bother you I would highly recommend it.
3903	5	I have been using these with my dogs for over two years. Although my beloved Maltese died recently, I still purchase as I now have a new Yorkie Puppy. I believe they help with their health and their teeth. Plus they are great for training.
3904	5	Besides the fact that it's the only food my fussy bunch of four agree they like...there are other reasons why I love Newman's Own. Check the label.  The first, and most abundant ingredient is organic turkey.  In fact, ALL of the ingredients are organic.  When others pets were sadly dying from contaminated food connected to China, I could rest assured my cats were OK.  Again, check the label...Newman's Own meets the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO...a factor my vet cautioned me on when I went looking for a high quality food. Finally, I buy it because Paul & Nell Newman produce a great line of products.  If you want to treat yourself, pick up a package of Newman's Own Organic Cookies.  It doesn't matter if you go for the Newman O's or the Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies...they're all terrific.
3905	5	Childhood dreams come true again! Couldn't find this product anywhere in stores near me, but finding it on Amazon truly made my day. So excited! Taste exactly like I remembered, haha.
3906	2	I can't speak to the quality or ingredients of this product.  All I can say is that my cats won't go near it.  I put it outside and the stray cats and possums don't seem to care for it either.  Won't buy it again.
3907	1	Kellogg's is hiding the truth about GMO's , Genetically Modified Organisms. Kellogg's is using the American public as a science experiment. If you really want your mind blown away do some research on GMO's. I will not consume any product which is made with an EPA registered pesticide.
3908	5	With other formulas, my daughter had really bad gas pains and far more spit-up incidents.  After switching to Gentlease, she has really thrived, gaining weight appropriately and seeming tremendously happy with it (and not so happy when we're 30 seconds slow in providing it to her :D).<br /><br />As for the corn syrup solids, this is simply there as a replacement for lactose, which is removed from gentle formulas.  It has to be replaced by something, so they use corn syrup solids.  I don't think there really is any major concern here, as sugar generally is sugar once it is broken down in the body, but I can see the reason for others to be concerned.<br /><br />One thing I would like to see, however, is Amazon include this on a subscription plan like Amazon Mom.  Enfamil is not inexpensive, and it is a regular consumable for my family.
3909	5	My young Havapoo was very unhappy when I put him in his cage at night.<br />After I bought this product for him as a treat before going to bed, he is readily willing to enter his cage, munch a few little pieces of the dried liver and go to sleep quite happy. I can recommend this product to all pet lovers.
3910	5	I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless.  It wasn't.  It tastes awful.  This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added.<br /><br />I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back.  This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product.  My disks are no longer slipped.  It has helped me to heal.<br /><br />A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life.  I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm.  I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.  <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE >Natural Calm Raspberry Lemon Flavor 16oz, Natural Vitality</a>
3911	4	I did like the green tea in k-cups ...I do agree it is a bit stronger than the tea bags...however all you have to do is add a bit more water ...I like it lots!
3912	4	Hotter than I expected.  Not much pepper flavor but great for adding heat to anything.  A nice fine powder if you want to sprinkle on popcorn.  Jar doesn't say what type of peppers they are unfortunately but that is o.k. for me.  The jar is larger than I expected but 4 ounces is 4 ounces.
3913	5	Very good cup of coffee.  Not as strong as some of the expresso or french roast brands which I also enjoy; so when you want something that has some body too it that's not that strong, then this is an excellent choice.
3914	4	Dark Magic doesn't taste overwhelming.  No burnt flavor. Tolerable straight black. I add creamer and one packet of stevia and it still holds it's bold flavor, just a little milder.  Nutty taste.
3915	3	This product needs to have better packaging.  Many of the biscuits arrived broken and crumbly which detracts from any prospect of reordering.
3916	3	These cookies were quite delicious, and reminded me of those my grandmother used to bake for me when I was a kid.  Unfortunately, I only got to taste them in very little bits, as every box was crushed and the cookies inside were broken into small bits and crumbs...I suspect this is a result of poor shipping/packaging on Amazon's behalf.
3917	5	Jeff:  I was so happy with my last order of this product, I wanted to send you a personal, hand written thank you note.  I love this product, but Lipton will not ship to me in Alaska.  So, when Amazon offered it, I was delighted and immediately placed an order.  Now, it's no longer available.  What happened?<br /><br />Jeff, keep up the good work.<br /><br />Sincerely, Linn J. Plous<br /><br />100 Trading Bay Drive #4<br /><br />Kenai, AK 99611
3918	5	This is the best rinse for dogs that we have ever found. I use it on my Mini Schnauzer and he smells so sweet--and I recommended it to my daughter who has a very SMELLY Black Lab....and she loves it too! Her house used to smell like dog as soon as you came through the door--even though she keeps it so clean--because her dog smelled--there is no doggy smell in my house now! Try it! for 5 bucks it's worth the chance believe me.
3919	1	Its taste so gross!! Its worse than cough syrup! I wish I could return it but its be a hassle for just the one item. Do not buy this flavor.
3920	2	My puppy chewed through the rubber tug pull within a few mins.<br />Not worth the money.
3921	1	Describing this material as  cranberry tea  seems unfortunate.  It is merely bitter black tea with a few shreds of something not definable. Perhaps I should have realized from the picture that it would have no cranberry flavor or scent and ordered the cranberry-apple instead.  I will return it to the company and they can compost it, because that is its only value. Laurence
3922	1	Bad product.  Gave to my 2 Labs & Beagle 3 times over 3 days.  All 3 dogs threw up each time.  Trashed the rest of the bag.
3923	5	Got these for a xmas gift. There is a lot of them in there to satisfy even the biggest mint fanatic!! Highly Recommend!! Great Deal!!
3924	5	I have a 1 year old lab puppy...He absolutely loves this toy! I was unsure I was buying greenies and a rawhide bone and this was suggested. It Kept him busy for hours and He even slept with it like it was a teddy bear!
3925	1	As simple as that: nutritional information is NOT accurate !!!<br />Iron content in purple bag is only 2%, NOT 45% as stated on the pouch itself !!!!!!!!!!!<br />Light green pouch  Rutabagas , contains Iron: 4%, NOT 120% stated on the package itself !!!!!!!<br />We have fed 2 packs daily: 1 light green  rutabagas  and 1 purple one -  pumpkins  to our girl since she was 3.5 month old.<br /><br />What a disappointment !!! This company should be held accountable for causing anemic, malnutritioned infants.<br />Wow, I can hardly keep my emotions !!!<br />FDA control anyone ...
3926	5	This 4-pound bag is a good product for those in need of wheat-free flour.  Makes very tasty bread. Much cheaper than buying a box of flour.
3927	4	Although they do not taste good, they are a healthy, low cal snack.  When you add light cream cheese or Laughing Cow cheese and a slice of lean meat, the taste improves.  Then you have a great snack for less than 100 calories that will keep you satisfied throughout the afternoon.
3928	5	This is the best Muesli I've ever found. I eat it for breakfast every day with soy milk, warmed in the microwave. MMMM good! All Bob's Red Mill products I have tried are excellent. I highly recommend them.
3929	5	I LOVE this pancake mix.  It is just a bit on the sweet side, but still super light and fluffy. We make a TON of them at one time and then freeze the extras for later.  My kids beg for waffles.
3930	4	Other than getting a TON of the bags at once, these are great! I add them to some other cereals to add some more flavor and nurients. Good stuff.
3931	5	If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer. That way they're sort of hidden from you (and others) but for some reason freezing them brings out the taste and consistency of the chocolate. Try it!
3932	5	These pretzels are absolutely delicious!  I did not notice the excess salt or burnt flavor some other people experienced - we loved them!
3933	3	It's the best treat ever... for appealing to humans.  Everyone where I work says this is the only dog treat they wish they could eat.  It smells, FABULOUS.  I mean, I've smelled a lot of dog treats.  I promise you, upon opening this bag, you'll go,  Wuhhh?  and take a deeper sniff.<br /><br />These are not always such a sure-fire hit with the dogs, however.  Some really go for them.  It's about 60/40, the haters & the lovers.  I honestly wish more dogs liked these, because they make my training pouch smell SO much better than those stinky chicken & cheese nuggets I'm often stuck handing out.  Honesty, however, compels me to admit I am often more in favor of these treats than the dogs.<br /><br />However; I emphasize that *some* dogs did quite like these.  They're a good fit for Kong stuffing and puzzle toys.  They're not a guarantee, but if your pup likes fruit, he will probably enjoy these.
3934	5	I have tried this flavor first time when my son was 6 months and he loved it right away. Did not have problem with texture either. This one and Chick Chick are his favorite right now.
3935	5	If you are a tea drinker taste this one you will drink no other after.<br />I have tried them all but this is the only one I drink now.
3936	4	I thought that because of the name attached that I would be wow-ed...its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular.
3937	5	I used to feed my cat products from Castor and Pollux, but this time I tried something else against her weight issue.<br />Today is the second day, so I can't tell if it works but my cat loves this one, too. (Honestly, she loves every food I give but anyway~)<br />One of the top rated holistic cat foods, I would recommend this one. Also super fast shipping from amazon prime yey!
3938	2	Well, I decided to share this with my daughters - 11 & 6 - apparently for my oldest daughter they sell this drink in her school. She loves it. Needless to say she was thrilled that I would get an opportunity to review it. I had never heard of it. So for a kids they loved it. Would I buy it, probably not. For such a small thin can, it has 140 calories. That's just too much! I would prefer they drink WATER! Good for the body and 0 calories. How about that?!  As an adult, I saw that although it is marketed as 100% natural, it did have 35 grams of sugar. Sugar is sugar - natural or artificial. I'll pass.  The kids give it five stars...and I give it two stars. So because mom is the actual reviewer, two stars wins.
3939	5	Pill Pockets are wonderful! I can not say enough good things about this product! I have a 2 year old terrier mix, Frodo, who has skin allergies. He has to take pills daily, and with Pill Pockets, he actually looks forward to pill time! They are simply a soft flavored (I have only purchased the Beef) treat with an opening in the center to put one or two pills inside, and then pinch closed. The beef remind me of a softer, rounder tootsie roll. Frodo loves them so much, he once got one off the counter before I got the pill inside! Frodo weighs 60 pounds and I buy the large size. I also have an older Lab mix dog, Casey, who occassionally needs medication. He weighs almost 100 lbs, and he loves the pill pockets as much as Frodo.
3940	5	I bought this food when I first adopted my cat. I strayed from the brand once, and purchased Purina cat food. The difference in my cat was night and day. With Blue, she had a gorgeous coat and the litter box was not scary at all. When she was on Purina for a few weeks, her coat lost its luster and her litter box - well, let's just say it wasn't pretty. We will never buy anything else again. The value of this product is amazing - yes, it's expensive, but your cat will eat less, look better, and be much happier. You will too!
3941	5	My little boy loves Toddler Health which is great because he doesn't always like to eat as well as I would like him to.  I mix it with rice or almond milk and it's good to go.  As a treat I'll blend it with some frozen fruit when he's hankering for ice cream or sweets.  It's nice knowing on the days when he won't eat one green vegetable that he is covered nutritionally.
3942	5	Who says all water tastes the same? I can tell the difference while drinking this. This stuff is the best most crisp bottled water I've had. I like to try different bottled waters, such as VOSS, Fred, Smart, Evian, etc. But nothing seems to top Figi, this stuff is truely refreshing. Buy some now!
3943	4	I learned about this product when I visited Japan.  They call it  Crazy Salt or KURESOL  and use it for everthing!<br />The package looked very American so after I came home, I googled (image search and compared to the photo on my iPhone) and was I right! It is sold here!!<br /><br />I use it in place of plain salt & pepper seasoning. Just 1:1.  I think since it is seasoned salt and herbs are basically fillers, I take less sodium if I go with the 1:1 ratio. I am salt sensitive and try not to have a lot of sodium in my diet so this product helps.
3944	1	I have two Great Danes who love chew-treat toys. Especially KONG. I brought the Everlasting Treat Balls Home and they both were able to pop out the treat within 2 minutes! They enjoyed the treats- but the expensive plastic ball is useless. I will be returning this product tomorrow!
3945	5	So, a few years back, when my son was just 18 months old, I discovered these and thought they'd be great with chili (they were!). As I was eating them, my son saw them and wanted to try them. I figured, what the heck, they were kinda spicy but not enough to hurt the little guy. So I gave him a couple. He loved them! So, I gave him a handful, and he munched away happily.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the next day.<br /><br />My wife is in the office when she hears a blood-curdling scream from my son's room!<br /><br />She rushes in to see what's the matter, and there stands my son, a look of panic on his face, yelling  Mom-Mom help! Hot poop! Hot poop!  as he reaches back into his diaper to try and get it all out.<br /><br />Needless to say, at the time my wife was not amused.<br /><br />However, this brand of cracker has henceforth and forevermore become known in our family as  Hot Poop Cheez-Its. <br /><br />And yes, my son still loves them.
3946	5	This is my favorite flavor of tea.  I enjoy white tea more than the darker teas, and the mix of peppermint and ginger is perfect.  If you enjoy any kind of peppermint tea or coffee (such as those served around Christmas) you will enjoy this tea.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the little white packet shown in the picture) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets.  If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />The only negative I've seen is that a few of the tea bags have  failed.   By  failed,  I mean that when I combine them with hot water they sometimes expand quickly and purge a small amount of tea leaves through the stapled end of the bag.  It's a minor distraction (only once or twice have I had to through it out), but it's probably a 4% failure rate based on my usage so far.  No doubt part of the problem stems from poor technique on my part, but I haven't had this problem with other teas.
3947	5	I have purchased this product many times, my wife and i found out about it through a web promotion, but the prices here on amazon are awesome and delivered very fast.  Salty, low cal ->Nutritious and delicious
3948	2	I have tried several varieties and had very high hopes for this Etheopian YigacheffeThe flavor is without question OFF. I am not sure what it is, but the flavor is flat, not much depth to this coffee. I am going to have to mix it with other coffees to add flavor, it is not very good on its own. I am sorry but I just can't reccomend it.
3949	5	The honey is sweet.  One stick is just the precise amount for teas, hot cererals, plain yogurt and for a snack.<br />Great for kids. Will definitely order more once supply is finished. Honey sticks and a box or two of tea would make a nice gift. Seller and product are highly recommended.
3950	5	My picky eater chihuahuas will finally eat healthy kibble as long as I add some of this to it.  They didn't like their kibble dry or when I added canned dog food to it; then it was too moist.  They love this!!!  I just shred some, mix with the kibble, and they are happy.<br />Whew!!!!  Finally.
3951	5	My dog loved this large bone! It actually lasted 2 weeks or so before it was gone.
3952	5	I love this tea! Not only is it good for your immune system but it helps acheive a clear complexion which is why i bought it in the first place. It also is a powerful antioxidant! I highly recommend it if you're looking for beauty on the inside and out!
3953	5	My cat seems to like to chew and so since he is a large cat.  He loves this dog green chews, I never find any left on the floor.  He has good breath too.
3954	5	This product has a surprise taste and I truly wonder why nobody has thought of this before.  It's the best of both coffee and tea in one infusion. It's got the best of everything in terms of convenience, taste, and triple bottom line. Here's what I love about it:<br /><br />TASTE:  The rich earthy depth of Arabica coffee infused with exotic overtones of berries and flowers. It's simply divine.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE: Each pouch is individually wrapped to preserve the aromatics, and the drink is steeped like tea, so there is no need for a press or coffee maker.<br /><br />ECO Friendly:  The coffee is 100% organic and fair trade. What's not to love about that?<br /><br />CHARITABLE: A portion of the proceeds of this beverage go to charity to promote youth soccer programs<br /><br />All in all this is a delicious, convenient yummy beverage and a new favorite in our home!<br /><br />Our other favorite is <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027CNY7U >Guayaki Traditional Mate Tea Bags, 75-count</a>
3955	5	I absolutely love this flour. I disagree that it is dense, especially since this is a whole wheat bread flour not a white, all-purpose flour. I first purchased the sampler pack and liked this flour the best. My flatbread is perfect and my no knead bread seriously was amazing on the first try ever. The taste is delicious. All in all, I definitely recommend this for the first-time or anytime baker :)
3956	5	Husband and Grandaughter LOVE this cocoa... Make it for them all the time as I drink my coffee.. My husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house.. Loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings.
3957	5	My dog has food allergies so we are always looking for treats made of vegetables/fruits. These are the perfect size to use for treats when doing tricks and she loves them!
3958	5	The only butterscotch pudding better than Jello's can be found at the Smith Brother's restaurants in Pasadena, California. If I use whole milk, it is identical!
3959	5	I normally prefer Lindt over Ghiradelli, but these chocolate chips are great. We've been using these to make superb chocolate oatmeal cookies.
3960	1	I was disappointed when I opened my first cookie that was ordered from Amazon.  Although I am still eating them, they were stale.  When ordered directly from Nanas Cookies, they were so fresh they were falling apart.  The aroma was delicious!
3961	4	We tried this recently. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First off, I am allergic to aspartame, so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there are<br />already off my radar.  After living in a place with nasty ol' well water for a few years, I developed<br />a soda habit that I am trying to break. I've tried plain tea, don't care much for it, so looked for<br />a decent flavored tea that I didn't have to boil water for (partially disabled, and no stove, etc<br />where I am most of the time).<br /><br />Last time at the store, I saw these. The package is a little deceptive, so be aware!<br />That  five calories  is not even for one whole bottle of water - it is for HALF of a bottle of water<br />with ONE packet mixed in! I guess they didn't want to post double-digits of a whopping ten calories,<br />but that's what it is for one packet.<br /><br />The sweeteners are THREE KINDS - Honey, Sugar AND Sucralose. Why they needed three, I do not know.<br />It actually ends up being a little too sweet. I make it, them dilute it with more water than<br />it technically needs.<br /><br />Not sure why Lipton can't just make something ALL natural, or use stevia, which has no effect on<br />blood glucose. They seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason, but I don't know why. They have no<br />problems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners, but avoid stevia!  Weird...<br /><br />I have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week, but I have been sick. I am not sure<br />if it is related to the illness, or because I've been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the last<br />few days. Aspartame makes my mouth, tongue and throat swell up, which is why I read every label now.<br />Not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not - I would tend to think not, because my lips are not<br />numb nor is my tongue swollen. Still, I'd avoid the sucralose if I could.<br /><br />The flavor is really sweet, but I like it. It is refreshing and tasty. Again, a little too sweet for my<br />personal tastes, so I  water  it down with lots of ice, and it makes it very good!<br />It's worth trying. This is the only flavor we've tried so far, but will definitely give the others a shot<br />as well. If it helps me give up soda, then that's even better! : )<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 9, 2012:<br /><br />Well, it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest, with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records.<br />Of course, I was drinking a lot of tea. These packets are 10 calories each (that  5 calories  on the box refers to HALF<br />of one packet!), and I had either one or two packets each day for the last month, perhaps.<br />We also tried the peach flavor now, and I don't care for it, but my husband and son like it better than this one.<br /><br />I had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd. Now, I am hypoglycemic, so maybe that is part of it,<br />but I have to mention it in case others have this problem. I got this tea originally to help me get away from my Pepsi habit.<br />The 24-oz bottles of Pepsi that I buy have 300 calories in the bottle. I make the tea kind of weak, so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me - I like the flavor better that way (just personal preference), so by comparison, I am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz, vs the 300 in the 24-oz Pepsi. Savings of about 97% of the calories, which should be a good thing!<br /><br />Here's the kicker - I have been GAINING WEIGHT since I changed over to the tea! Nothing else has changed. I didn't suddenly<br />take up eating endlessly, etc, and in fact, have eaten a little less during this heat wave. I put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea. Now, from a caloric standpoint, it doesn't seem possible. However, I am one of those people who does much better on high-protein, low-carb. If you have a similar type of metabolism/body, then be aware of these little packets!  I think it might be the honey in them creating a non-stop (because I sip tea all day long to keep cool) assault on my blood sugars. I've noticed that I feel hungry more often as well too. I normally don't get all that hungry - just have a few hungry days once in a while. With this tea, it almost gives you the munchies. I haven't indulged, so it isn't from extra food. It has to be the tea.<br /><br />Again, I have to say that I don't think that everyone will experience this effect, but wanted to bring it up.<br />I think the combo of the THREE sugars Lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally.<br />I still like the tea, but have now been cutting it down even more, to see if I can lessen the effects of the sweeteners.<br />I find it odd to think that I could cut out 590 calories a day (I usually drank two of those 24-oz pepsis! Yes, I was bad...) and GAIN weight. It has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system.<br /><br />So, if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low-carb diet, be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress, or even cause you to gain weight. I have also warned my husband, who tends towards higher blood glucose, to only drink it with meals, never alone like I do.  Just an important heads-up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long, long time.<br /><br />Lipton - please try making something with stevia, which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories. Why put sucralose into your items, when stevia is so much better?  I don't get it - it can't be that much cheaper to use! And I'd pay more for an item that used stevia... what a shame!
3962	4	I love all these different flavors that they have come out with for Blue Diamond almonds.  Soooo Goood.  While this one wasn't as good as the Wasabi flavor, it was still delicious.
3963	5	This is great hot chocolate.....Not watery like some others and my husband really likes this one.....Thank you.  Pat Greenough, Boise, Id.
3964	4	This variety is vegan, according to their website. I'm not sure I would recommend buying in bulk if you haven't tried them before, but they are quite tasty and I WOULD definitely recommend trying them! ;)
3965	3	I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with  meal  of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.
3966	5	My puppies love this food! I have a shih tsu and a chiguagua. The price for this product is also decent.  I would definitely recommend it.
3967	5	I purchased this as a gift for my Mom who lived in Traverse City and loves Michigan cherries.  She loves this coffee, says the flavor is not fake or overwhelming but strong enough that you can really taste the cherry.
3968	4	Busy. Busy. Busy. Tis the season to run around and get run down. The Ambrosoli-Honee Energy Plus Vitamin caramels are a delicious way to boost your immune system and stay healthy on the go.<br /><br />There's no yucky tang or aftertaste, just the flavor of caramel and honey. This supplement is buttery and sweet, and you don't have to feel guilty about indulging. I was pleasantly surprised these.
3969	5	If you're not from Minnesota you might not know what Caribou Coffee is; quite simply it is some of the best coffee on the market.  It has a delicious smokiness to it that is not overpowering and does not taste burnt like Starbucks.  Coffee is not supposed to taste burnt!  The Caribou Blend is their  middle  roast that has made them what they are and is very well balanced.  It has an amazing flavor and is easy on the stomach too, as I personally have difficulty with some coffee roasts and digestion.
3970	5	From the moment I cut open the sealed bag containing the coffee pods, I could appreciate the quality of this coffee, as the wonderful aroma enveloped my senses.  The coffee taste only bolstered my appreciation, as the flavor was rich and delicious.  Highly recommended!  (Note: I have no connection with this company... just a happy customer)
3971	5	These chips are just what I have been looking for -- they are very tasty and also nutritious!  The first ingredient is bean flour made from 3 different beans, and they are baked.
3972	3	Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake-feet products: this is not one of them.
3973	5	I decided to get this item for my new shelter dog.  He went through dog toys like mad and most dog chews would be swallowed whole, only to be puked up later on.  I was trying to find a product that he would get excited about chewing on and wouldn't be destroyed within minutes.  Boy did this fit the bill!  He has had it for well over a month now and has not even made his way through 25% of it yet.  It doesn't have a smell and it hasn't broke off into pieces.  I recommend this product to all my friends who have dogs and will be buying another one when the time comes!
3974	5	I love these pinto beans. Prior to soaking them I always put them in a strainer but unlike most pinto beans bought in bulk, there's never any foreign objects that need to be discarded. I appreciate the package size. To prepare. I cover them with water (about 3 inches over the top) in a pot, cover it and let it soak overnight. In the morning, discard the water (it can be used for watering your plants) and, if making a whole box, add 6 cups (3 cups of liquid for every 8 ounces of beans) of water, or broth, bring to a boil, then simmer covered for 90 minutes.<br /><br />They are delicious and highly nutritious (you probably already knew that). Of course, that they are organic, also makes them even more appealing, in my mind.<br /><br />I've purchased this product twice (total of 12 boxes). I've used ten of the twelve boxes and the quality is consistent.<br /><br />Buy and enjoy with confidence.
3975	5	Love this cereal and was delighted finally to find it at Amazon. Doubly good to have it delivered at specific times throughout the year. Great breakfast is now continually ensured.
3976	5	I am very restricted in what I can eat, and I eat a lot of rice products including ricecakes.  I get teased alot about eating  cardboard  until I let people taste these little crackers.  They are always shocked at how good they are and quit teasing me.  Thanks for making a product that I can eat....and enjoy!!!
3977	5	Nice texture, wonderful taste! My other half isn't a garlic lover and he wasn't offended by the amount of garlic in the product. Much cheaper and a better product than those big companies. Highly reommed this; I like it so much I have it on scheduled delivery.
3978	5	What can I say. I've now tried nearly every Extra Bold Decaf K-cup made and this is my favorite. It's a full bodied, rich, complex coffee that tastes  better  than 95% of the leaded coffees I've tried over the years. I set my Keurig to the 10 oz. mug setting, push the button, and enjoy! My second favorite (and very different) coffee is Coffee People Donut Shop Extra Bold Decaf, although I am looking forward to trying Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast.<br /><br />PS. I have to drink decaf only now, but no compromise in taste thanks to this great coffee.
3979	4	Okay so I didn't expect anything spectacular but both my husband and I tried this and we were both a little dumbfounded. I don't really know how to explain it and all my husband had to say was it tasted  soft  We have filtered water and it there was a difference. This water is refreshing. Worth the price? Ummm, not in my opinion. I think we are an average household and there's no way we would afford to drink this on a regular basis. We do want to stress that we did like the water, but not for this price. I'll stick to my filtered/bottled water.
3980	5	As far as the ingredients are concerned, the chips do seem healthier than regular chips. BBQ flavor is my favorite.  Be careful they are addicting and you could eat a whole bag if you were really hungry.  I haven't yet but i've eaten half a bag.
3981	5	She (my cat) is happy with this stuff and the price was good for my budget so that makes two of us.
3982	5	I'm a busy mom with two jobs and a 6 month old. I want to make my own baby food but I really don't even have five extra minutes to do that. HappyBaby pouches are my go to! I started adding Apple Cherry to my daughters cereal because she didn't want to eat the rice cereal plain. Now she gobbles it up! I feel good that she is getting awesome organic fruit in her cereal that doesn't have added sugar or color and it only took me a few seconds to get it prepared for her.
3983	5	I was using a different product and my scalp was irritated, red, and flaky. This felt like a milder, calming version that cut back on those symptoms. There is a slight tingle, but it is less irritating. The smell is also nice which is a huge plus. If you have an irritated scalp I would highly recommend this product.
3984	4	I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.
3985	1	the one i got says  cleanse  on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say  cleanse  on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive
3986	4	My puppy liked these dental bones but they are only up to 15 pound puppy's my puppy weighs more then now. When my puppy was eating these his breath smell clean and it was not to hard on puppy's teeth.
3987	4	It tastes good for the convenience and has enough caffeine to get me through a work day.  It comes in packets that are easily split up if you are sharing, or good if you need them on-the-go.
3988	5	The tug-a-jug keeps my boarder collie busy for hours! I just put her normal food in the jug and she thinks it's a game to get the food! It is wonderful.  I don't sugest using it in any rooms with glass doors (like on an entertainment center) though, they break from the hard plastic jug.<br />WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!
3989	5	My family and I have enjoyed Mona's Original Granola for several years and it became a good habit for all of us with our yogurt for breakfast.  Even the grown-up  kids  took it home with them when they visited.  Then we were unable to find it and I looked on Amazon's search engine and found it again.  Great news!   Mona  and coffee are the lifestays around our house in the morning.  Mona is always fresh, tasty and delicious.
3990	5	This is exactly what I thought it would be.  The little individual packets of cereal.  Great for snacks.  I actually bought them to send for lunch at school.  My 5 year old loves having cereal for lunch.  I decided on these for the great price but when she couldn't screw on the thermos top and got milk every where this was my solution.  I even put them in the car for snack in the car.  They are only 8 grams of sugar.  I couldn't be happier!!  Thinking about getting another box.
3991	5	I love this tea!  It's full bodied yet mild.  I've been drinking this tea for approximately 20+ years and wouldn't switch to any other brand.  I always take a few bags with me when traveling just in case I can't buy it wherever I happen to be because I can't be without my daily cup of tea (or two or three cups).
3992	5	Yes, I should have hidden these from my son. He couldn't get enough of them. I couldn't be too upset since it was his first experience with Mallomars. There is just something awesome about the combination of textures and flavors.<br /><br />So yes, I knew I liked this before I bought it. But it's been years since I've eaten them. I have to confess I like them better than moon pies. Not something I'll be saying next time I visit family in Texas. But these are a lot less heavy handed and just right.<br /><br />Fun food. If you like crispy cookies, marshmello (ms?) like filling and chocolate, this is a cookie for you.
3993	5	I bake bread every week with this flour and I am very pleased with it. I first got the Great River gift pack and when I ran out of this flour, I ordered more.  I haven't had a bad loaf yet.  :)
3994	5	Perk's you to life without being overbearing, that is to say, no  painful stomach upset afterwards. Aroma is very delightful and brew very tasteful even from an instant coffee's lover point of view.
3995	5	This is a great product at a very good /reasonable price in the six pack.  Try it with walnuts, blueberries and raisins...  tastes more like desert.
3996	1	How does a multimillion dollar company ship a product to it's customers in a paper bag? Yes, it came in a shipping box...but the product itself (24 flavored K-Cups) were all thrown inside an unmarked brown bag and stapled. Leads one to believe that they're cashing in on unsellable broken boxes of K-Cups, sad part is that they're still getting PRIME FULL PRICE!!! Well, a lesson has been learned and I will not purchase this  item  again...Thanks Amazon! And by the way, almost a third of the contents were that disgusting GROVE SQUARE brand and various decaf (of which we don't drink!) Such a convenient way to dump your stock of the brands & brews that don't move! Shopping via the internet is okay most times but it can damn sure bite you in the ass as well. The only reason they got ONE STAR is because of the Kahlua Blend, which was very good.
3997	5	If you like spicy snack food, this is it.  I love this product.  My favorite is the ketchup fries.  I tried the buffalo one and Wow!  Too hot, but good.  The regular ones are good.  My store will not stock up on these so I'm buying here.  These are REAL tasty.  Will buy again.  Also, they don't weight you down.  They are light and no trans fats.  Yum!
3998	4	These tasted good, but after listening to other reviews , i don't think these tasted that good. The cheese taste is not that strong, and regular cheese popcorn tastes better in my opinion.
3999	5	These Soy & Wasabi almonds from Blue Diamond are my absolute favorite - just enough kick & the almonds tide you over until mealtime. The resealable bag keeps them nice & fresh.  Love them!!
4000	1	This is the worst apple cider I have ever drank. It sounded good--caramel apple. Does not taste anything like that. Will never purchase again & now I am stuck with these.
4001	1	I liked the flavor of this energy drink, and I agree with the reviewers that say this tastes like Hawaiian Punch.  However, it is NOT all natural!  It contains the artificial sweetener, sucralose.  This is a deal breaker for me.  Sucralose gives me headaches; even if it didn't cause such a reaction for me, it bothers me that the manufacturer advertises this as all natural, when it clearly is not.
4002	5	So chocolaty and spiced just right! I decided to try this brand after reading all the wonderful reviews. I'd never had spiced hot chocolate before - just the plain store-bought instant kind. WOW! The flavor of this just blew me away! Best cup of hot chocolate I've ever tasted!! I'm hooked!!
4003	5	I love black licorice, but not just any black licorice.  I'm very fussy - I want real molasses and licorice extract in my licorice, not corn syrup and artificial flavors.  Panda is the real thing and it tastes divine.  I am on the subscription service now because this is the only licorice I want to eat and I can't always find it locally.  Also, the new ziploc packaging is wonderful - it keeps the licorice fresh and soft.  So, if you love the taste of black licorice, stop eating junk and try Panda.  You'll be hooked!
4004	5	This is my ultimate comfort food. I have been eating these things since I was a kid and they were always my favorite and I still love them to this day and I am 46 years old. I know its crap food but heck, you only live once. These are just as cheap as getting them at the grocery store if you do Subscribe and Save and you don't have to lug them home. If you liked canned ravioli, you will drool over these. They are really filling, too. I am a big eater but I can eat one can of these and I'm satisfied. Yummy!
4005	2	I bought this brand because I heard good things about it and I was comfortable with the ingredients that were list. When I tried to feed it to my dog he would not touch it and usually he is not a picky eater. This is not a negative review in any way against the product itself but just an FYI to other pet owners.
4006	2	I bought this product to occupy my 13-month-old mix.  She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough.  When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber  pull  was already in pieces.  While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does.  Especially for eleven dollars!
4007	5	My husband's favorite loose green tea.  He drinks every morning, and it is a little better price than from Stash.
4008	4	This was the first time I ordered K Cups from Amazon, arrived quickly and I really liked the Medium roast Organic Blend By Newman, I liked the Decaf also and will drink it but only if I do not have Timothy's decaf I liked it better. jgibson
4009	2	They just dont have that slim jim snap. Really, they are kind of gross. m brother seems to like hem though so all is not lost.
4010	5	My child took to this flavor of Ella's immediately, moaning with delight with every slurp. Soon enough, she was able to drink down the container on her own using the spout, which was a new skill of hers I can attribute to the spinach, apple and rutabaga Ella's!
4011	5	You will give up brewed coffee for the Starbucks VIA Ready Brew.  Our whole family loves it.  We love Starbucks and can now enjoy it all day long at home.
4012	5	These are great pretzels, better than regular ones.  Crunchy with just the right amount of salt.  Opened a bag at work and my co-workers ate them right up.
4013	5	Some coconut oil has no taste or a bad after taste.  EfaGold oil tastes like coconut!  Love it!  We use it for every thing.
4014	5	Ordered the Peanut butter with dark chocolate first and these were exceptionally good.  Then went back and ordered the coconut and almond which was outstanding too!  Put both on auto-shipment so I'm not left without.  Can't believe the awesome price I got too!!
4015	5	We had a sample of these crackers in a store and loved them.  They're tasty, crunchy, filled with various seeds, and incredibly high in fiber while low in calories.  They're also gluten-free.  We love them with cheese or by themselves as a healthy snack.  We're so glad we found these on amazon.com so we can have them any time!
4016	3	I am definitely in the middle of the fence regarding this product. :-(<br /><br />The good:<br />* Non-BPA packaging (as we all know, almost impossible to find for a plain tomato product)<br />* low in sodium<br />* not sourced in China<br /><br />Now for what I consider the downsides (other than the price, which may not be a deterrent to some).<br /><br />First, compared to the no-salt-added product I used to use (Del Monte Petite Cut Tomatoes, No Salt Added), I do think these tomatoes have FAR less taste. The difference is not due to salt content because the sodium content as given on the packaging of both products is the same. IMHO the Pomi tomatoes taste less  tomato-y  than what I used to buy (a friend who also tried the Pomi said she finds the taste  insipid ). But that is not my main gripe.<br /><br />The package claims 26 1/2 oz net weight (approximately, but close enough). However, a LOT of that weight is the watery juice from the tomatoes and thus I was unpleasantly surprised to see how little of that 26.46 oz is actually TOMATOES. So one day I took the time to strain the package and see exactly how much chopped tomato there is, versus their juice. The strained chopped tomato pieces were weighed on my electronic kitchen scale and came to 13.4 oz; the juice which was strained directly into a measuring cup came to just below the 11 fluid oz mark. Also, some of that 13.4 oz of chopped tomatoes also included a little bit of juice as well, since they were impossible to drain completely  dry . So this means that for the current price ($2.50 per box of Pomi at my local supermarkets) you are getting only about 13 oz of chopped tomatoes. That comes to about 19 cents per ounce. Hmmmmmm.<br /><br />This made me curious enough to invest in a  throwaway  can of my former choice, the Del Monte Petite Cut tomatoes which comes in a 14.5 oz can, to see how they compared. I strained it in the same manner as I did the Pomi. The results: I got 12 oz of actual tomatoes and only 2.5 oz of their juices. The can of Del Monte was $1.29 (at the same large supermarket chain that sells the Pomi for $2.50) which comes to 10.7 cents per ounce... almost half the cost of the Pomi if you are calculating how much actual chopped tomatoes you get for the money.<br /><br />I must also comment that the consistency of the Pomi chopped tomatoes is much  mushier  than the Del Monte petite cut or other typical canned ones ... in fact, IMHO the Pomi chopped is more than halfway to  sauce  consistency right out of the box, which is okay for some recipes but not good for others. The Del Monte diced served me perfectly in that regard but again... that darned BPA in their cans! :-(<br /><br />I really DID want to love the Pomi chopped tomatoes and if it was only the taste and the consistency that disappointed, I could probably learn to live with those shortcomings. However the realization that they cost almost twice the price for approximately the same quantity of ACTUAL chopped tomatoes compared to the equivalent canned product, is very frustrating especially in today's economy. Because I usually need little or none of the juice which makes up more than 35% of the package's contents, basically I'm paying a 90% premium for the non-BPA packaging.<br /><br />There should really be a better alternative but I've yet to find it. The few tomatoes in glass jars that I have found, have all contained spices (which I can't use, being allergic to garlic and onion) or have high sodium contents. Ideally, I wish Pomi would add a straining step to this product (which perhaps Del Monte does?) so that their package would contain more tomatoes and less liquid.
4017	5	Barrys Gold Blend Tea is the finest cup of tea that one can buy. To Traveler who only gave it 4 stars I say it probably did not taste right because your water was crap. Real tea does not have a string attached to the bag. You just need boiling water, leave it to stew for a minute or so, sugar and milk to taste.<br /><br />A that reminds me, it's time for a cup of Barrys.
4018	5	Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q >Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.
4019	5	The only thing I can say is that these chocolate bars are so good plus they arrive on time and well taken care of....I'm very satisfied customer!! :)
4020	5	I don't like a lot of herbal teas.  Lots of them taste the way health food stores smell--like herbs and vitamins--or else they go way off the flowery end.<br /><br />Yogi Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy Tea is hearty without being overpowering, the herbs are evident without being weird, and it provides a real afternoon pick me up.  I was a little worried about the caffeine.  Afternoon sodas, regular tea and coffee disturb my sleep at night, but this seems to have no ill effects.  It smells wonderful, the vanilla is the predominant flavor and aroma but it's not all vanilla.  There's enough spice to make it interesting without being a chai.  It's definitely tea and is a true  beverage that cheers and does not intoxicate .  It's a very nice afternoon break and does seem to provide a little energy, though that may just be the power of suggestion.<br /><br />There's lots of stuff in this tea.  Green tea and black tea, and a lot of other things that sound like they came from the ashram in Eat Pray Love.  I haven't had the urge to start meditating since I've been drinking this, so it's safe if you want to stay mainstream, and it really is delicious.<br /><br />Just as an aside, it would also make an excellent base for a hot adult beverage if one felt inclined to add a shot of something to a cup after a long freezing afternoon spent shoveling the mountains of snow we've had this winter. Not that I've tried that or anything.
4021	5	My only complaint is how long it took to ship from the UK to the United States. But, that's not Marmite's fault. I am a recent devotee of Marmite, having only found out about it, and that I could get it here a couple months ago. After devouring 2 bottles of the regular, I had to order this. Man, am I glad I did. I mean Marmite is good, but if I am going to pay a premium for it anyway (125g jar here for $6), then $15 for a jar twice the size, with twice the taste is worth it to me. Thanks for making this available to me.
4022	5	This coffee is surprising rich and free of bad overtones.  A great everyday mix and so far, holding up well.  I grind enough for several days out of necessity and discern no difference in freshness from day to day.  I store the beans in a cool garage and find not a note of rancidity after nearly a month and a half of storage.
4023	5	oh how I love thee, my Dark Magic K-cup. I would count the ways but that might be a bit much. Bold and strong - not as bold as Double Black Diamond but in that ballpark. If you are a fan of SB Verona than you should like this too. If you like Nantucket, Breakfast Blend or Coffee Shop it might be too bold for you. It's perfect for a 12oz cup or even a 14oz travel mug.
4024	1	This drink doesn't taste anything like fruit punch. And I don't know how anyone can call it  light . It is hard to explain the taste but the closest I can come is that it is a heavy cherry taste similar to what you would get if you drank the juice out of canned cherries (only not as tart).<br /><br />No one in my family can stand this stuff.<br /><br />Do I recommend this drink? NO WAY!
4025	3	My kitty was getting around a little better after eating these treats for a few days but then she stopped eating them. Maybe she'll like them again later.
4026	5	These taste great, and better than the more generic swiss-miss types. The chocolate tastes nice and rich. My family likes this product quite a bit.
4027	4	I first had these in England and have been wanting to eat them again.  They came well packaged; each individual package was wrapped in bubble wrap.  However, the first few cookies in the first pack (I've only eaten the one pack so far) were a bit broken and crumbly, but the rest in the package were fine.  The cookie is not overly sweet, and the sweet taste mostly comes from the chocolate coating on the top.  While they are not the most delicious cookie made, they are quite good and bring back fond memories.
4028	4	Based on the reviews here I tried some of the jerky from Buffalo Bills. This is the only one I think I would order again. Moist, tender, very good flavor.
4029	5	From pancakes to pies Bisquick makes baking easier as the hard work is pretty well done. Bisquick is a baking mix that has flour, shortening and leavening already mixed up and ready-to-go for making biscuits or pancakes. In fact, if you read the history of Betty Crocker, and General Mills, you will discover Bisquick was developed after a company employee enjoyed hot biscuits while traveling on the train. The employee wondered how the train's cook was able to bake up the biscuits so quickly. The cook showed the General Mills employee his pre-made biscuit mix. Bisquick was created after the General Mills employee returned from his trip.<br /><br />Today, you can use Bisquick to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, quick breads, cookies and Impossibly Easy Pies. It is a true workhorse in the kitchen.<br /><br />Books you can read about General Mills and Bisquick include <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0816650187 >Finding Betty Crocker: The Secret Life of America's First Lady of Food (Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage)</a>; <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605298166 >Betty Crocker Ultimate Bisquick Cookbook Exclusive Deluxe Edition 323 Delicious recipes for breakfast, dinner, dessert & more!</a>, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470916575 >Bisquick to the Rescue: More than 100 Emergency Meals to save the day!</a>, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764559176 >Betty Crocker Bisquick Impossibly Easy Pies: Pies that Magically Bake Their Own Crust</a>.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
4030	5	as I was reading reviews on this product, I was hesitant to try it because so many said it had a bad taste....I liked it....I am enjoying it as a lunch time sandwich in my thin breads....hoping to help me lose some weight...isn't that the reason most people buy this product? It's a little costly....of course....but for me...worth the price.
4031	4	I first tried it using water - blech!  Using milk makes it infinitely better.  I use 2% milk at home so I can't comment on 1% or skim, but I found that the milk makes the coffee a little richer, and cuts down on the artificial sweetener aftertaste.
4032	5	fastest shipping around and zsweet is the best artifical sweetener there is i use it in my sweet tea and im a southern boy and we drink some tea tastes just like sugar im on a low carb diet it works great thanks amazon for such great prices and free shipping
4033	4	Really enjoying the FG products I've ordered. I'm a little mixed on this one, but I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers. ;)<br /><br />Macaroni:<br />Great to get so much fiber and fewer calories in a noodle that tastes just like any other. Very pleased, would have given this 5 stars had this just been macaroni. So far their pasta products have been excellent - both in taste, texture, nutrition and calories.<br /><br />Sauce packet:<br />I agree with the other reviewers, this is far from creamy and cheesy, and most of us  doctor  it to get flavor and texture. (I dare anyone to upload a photo that looks like the one on the box!) Adding cheese turns this into less of the guilt-free item I was looking for, and more of an occasional treat for us due to the saturated fat in cheese. Still, better for you due to the noodles, so not quite as taboo if you're health conscious but miss the old  blue box .<br /><br />In addition to the cheese, you can also do what you do with other products like this and toss in cooked vegetables like broccoli or fresh peas, and meats like ham or lean ground beef, turkey or chicken to make it a balanced meal.<br /><br />Happy eating! :)
4034	5	Her's my problem with people like the previous reviewer. I don't need your novice, pseudo medical opinion for a product you have not tried. You are as bad as the people that review a recipe after they change 6 ingredients and then say it was just okay. They didn't review the recipe at hand! I digress... The company has been making this stuff for over 30 years and have not seen any issues or side effects. In fact, dogs and cats seem to love it and they seem happier with better coats. From the Avoderm website:<br /><br /> SAFETY<br />You can feel quite confident in AvoDerm® pet products safety and nutritional value. In the over 30 years since Breeder's Choice first introduced this product line, millions of dogs and cats worldwide have consumed AvoDerm® with no negative reactions from avocado oil or meal.<br /><br />AvoDerm® pet products use only carefully selected suppliers of avocado meal and avocado oil. Years of problem-free consumption of these products indicate that AvoDerm products are not only safe for dogs and cats, but also provide vital nutrients for them.<br /><br />Concern has been expressed by the ASPCA about the consumption of the leaves, fruit, bark, and stems from the avocado tree, with the exception of the avocado fruit which is used for the oil and meal; none of these parts are factors in any of the AvoDerm® pet products formulations and we have no indication that avocado oil and meal as used in AvoDerm® are toxic, poisonous, harmful or bad for your dogs or cats diet.<br /><br />Dr. Art Craigmill, UC Davis, Professor and Extension Specialist in Environmental Toxicology has said that his studies and other research in the United States and Australia have shown that the problem of toxicity is in the leaves and the pit of the Guatemalan variety; the avocado meat of the fruit and oils have not been shown to be toxic. AvoDerm pet products do not utilize any Guatemalan variety avocados, nor do we use any leaves or pits of any variety of avocados for our avocado meal and oil.<br /><br />The avocado meal and oil used in the AvoDerm pet products comes from the meat of the fruit and does not contain leaves, bark, skin or pit of the fruit. The oil is extracted from ripened fruit in which the meat pulp has been separated from the skin and the pit. Through a mechanical separation process the oil is extracted and filtered and placed into sealed containers. The pulp of the fruit is dried, ground, and screened before being placed into its final packaging and than shipped to our facility. <br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Do your own research, research the company or the claims about the ingredients or try it for yourself. My dog (Yorkshire Terrier) seems to love this food. He gets excited and waits by his bowl when he knows it is almost time to eat. He does this even for just the dry food alone! Other dry foods that I have tried before would require me to mix in some wet food after a while to make it more appealing. Not Avoderm - he is still always excited to eat it. He also gets a spoonful of the wet food in the afternoon as a snack and he goes even more bonkers for that stuff. I am happy with it - I will be trying the grooming products next.
4035	5	My three very finicky dogs love this product, and I like the way I can cut them up into small pieces for training.  There is only one ingredient in this: liver, all sourced within the United States, so I feel confident and safe giving this to my dogs.  I buy this on a regular basis.  It's priced better than any pet supply store I've seen, even the larger chains.  Qualifies for free shipping, which is also nice.
4036	5	My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem.
4037	5	Great Coffee for those that like what in America would be STRONG coffee. Even at a mug size with one pod the coffee is nice and not  thin .<br /><br />Highly recommend it!!
4038	5	Will not last as long as you would think.  A little bite here and a little bite there and suddenly its gone...
4039	5	Got into EFS thru my training group. I had been having stomach issues with hard training, and decided it was time to ditch the Gatorade. This seems to fuel me much better, and the lemon lime flavor is pretty good. I only use it for cycling, not for run hydration. As long as you only use it for serious training and racing, one tub (altho pricey), will last you a good long while. Worth the switch from Gatorade!
4040	5	Well people these are a real welcome treat and taste very good indeed. The tuufiddy ml glass bottle was a bit bigger than i thought :-) (16,5 cm tall) None of my four time glass bottle`s had that cool paper card on the neck of the bottle, just the gold foil. There is a soft seal & cap on the inside of every white plastic cap wich may be used to keep it well, sealed! This white  short skirt  plastic cap looks good on the bottle once the gold foil is removed. Most have a golden sticker on the top of the cap with the grade type. Mine came packed with a good amount of big bubble wrap around them. As you may have noticed all these style bottle`s hold the medium amber type (second out of of the 4 grades/blends) The taste is vey rich and sugary with a very nice presence of aroma from what i would suspect is the maple tree! Also, you may want to get a 36 oz.  refill  tin of your own choice. At room temperature this stuff has about the same viscosity as fish oil, maybe a tad thicker..and it can even be freezed without it becoming  solid  just thick. Shelf life is very good. Uses: to be taken  internally ;-) at presence i just drink the stuff as i have yet to incorporate it into my waffles/pancakes and what have you...Recommended!
4041	5	These are the best chips I have eaten. They are popped instead of fried or baked which makes them easier on the weight column.<br /><br />Love them, love them.
4042	5	Our two little Toy Manchester Terriers (8.5 lbs) have very sensitive digestive systems so we are careful what we feed them and they are also a bit fussy about what they'll eat.<br />This flavor - Rotisserie Chicken and Chicken with Rice agrees with them just fine and they love it for the 2x a day feedings.<br /><br />We do feed a moistened dry high quality dry food mixed in with the Mighty Dog just to make 100% sure they're getting a well balanced diet and we like them to have a bit of crunchy food to help keep their teeth clean.<br /><br />Our vet tells us they're both in tip top shape and their coats have a beautiful show quality shine. We believe that the food they consume has a lot to do with that.<br /><br />Yes, Mighty Dog is a little higher priced than some but it's a good quality food that along with regular vet visits and exercise will keep your dog healthy for their lifetime.
4043	5	I have been in love with this product for about a year now. I love PB chocolate. It is SO delicious. I feed my cravings with little calories, great nutrition, and amazing taste. I wish they would have a 5 lbs. pack, because 1pound package does not last long in my house (my husband also love it).
4044	5	Wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing. There is no after-taste at all and it very satisfying, you always want another cup of coffee. I continue to buy it.
4045	2	Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies, some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags. The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent/normal size but they really are a bit smaller. Case they are shipped in is great for storage, in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase. Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies though...unless you like dark, crumby hard ones.
4046	5	$0.42 for a cup of coffee- sure beats buying at Starbucks or another coffee joint. And this tastes better than most of the flavored K-Cups I've tried.
4047	1	I have dogs who are 85 pounds. They chewed the bottle toy in less than 10 minutes; trashed it.<br />I have not tried this with a little dog.
4048	4	I was pleasantly surprised by these bars.  Usually nutritional snack bars, particularly gluten-free vegan bars, are mediocre to terrible.  Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bars are delicious!  They consist primarily of dates, like chocolatey Fig Newtons.  The almonds provide a satisfying crunch.  The bars are 190 calories, 25g of carbs (unfortunately, 17g of those are sugars, which is why these bars get 4 stars instead of 5), 7g of protein, and 8g of fat (only 1g saturated).  The bars are filling as well - they could easily get you through from breakfast to lunch, or provide a good afternoon snack.  And because they're gluten-free, they won't bloat you.  If you're looking for a candy-bar-like 'nutrition' bar, look elsewhere. You won't find milk chocolate or drizzled caramel here.  But if you're looking for a delicious, much lower carb option than a Clif Bar, give these a try.
4049	2	So let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of anything with marshmallows and/or mallow product of any kind. My boyfriend and I saw these and thought they sounded delicious, and they turned out to be a huge disappointment. The quality of the chocolate is terrible, I'm talking  Russel Stover  terrible: grainy, chalky, and hard. The  mallo  filling isn't too bad, but there isn't much of it, and the coconut is essentially non-existent. What you basically end up with is a mouth full of grainy, terrible chocolate flavor with sweet milky aftertaste from the wannabe marshmallow filling.<br /><br />If these things were more like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups with filling similar to the marshmallow in either Rocky Road candy bars or Hagen Dazz Rocky Road ice cream they would be awesome. And they should either have more coconut or none at all, because right now it only adds to the grainy texture without adding any flavor.<br /><br />Anyway, I seriously regret buying these- ESPECIALLY SINCE I LATER FOUND HUGE PACKS OF THEM AT THE DOLLAR TREE! -_-
4050	1	I ordered two boxes of these -- one for myself, one for a thank you gift. After opening my box, I realized that I would be ashamed to give these candies as a gift. I have been to Belgium and have eaten many Belgium chocolates, and these are just poor quality -- overly sweet with little flavor. They arrived bruised from the shipping and looked like they were ten years ago (dried out and marked). Absolutely horrible.
4051	3	Although this is one of the best instant coffees in the world, I second another review here. Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months. So, unless you consume one of these at least 2-3 times per week - which I don't per se - watch out. Also, I shaved off a star bc of the poor packaging design of the individual packets. When you tear off the corner (the way they indicate where and how to open it)  the opening is still very small and a fair amount of powder is still left in the packet unless you shake it vigorously and make sure it all comes out, or simply chop off the top with a scissor.
4052	5	We call this kitty crack because we can literally get our cats to do anything for it. If they won't come in at night, we shake the bottle and they come running. They jump up on the chair and sit up for a small piece. It is nice to have some kind of control over this uncontrollable species!
4053	3	This pistachio paste did the job and made good tasting gelato but was on the sweet side, very strong flavor.  I'm going to try the more expensive  Bronte pistachio cream  to see if its any better.  Bronte not available on Amazon
4054	4	But do I taste some artificial flavor in here?  A little cream or vanilla Soy and maybe some sugar DOES mellow out what appears to be a slightly spiky note to the otherwise great flavor. However, this is something I can live with, as the overall taste, fresheness, aroma and quality of the coffee is very enjoyable.
4055	5	This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do.
4056	3	I'm not any kind of coffee snob since I usually kill it with creamer anyway, but I do love my flavored coffee, vanilla expecially.  I've had some mixed results with Starbucks coffee, generally preferring their plain roasts, but I've never tried Fusions.  I think I'd rather stick to another brand for my flavored.<br /><br />The bag itself was a lot different from nearly any bag of coffee I'd ever purchased pre-packaged.  It was sealed, but not vaccum-packed, and the loose grounds only filled about 2/3s of the bag.  This isn't a brick.  It also was extremely easy to open, which was nice for my fingers, but considering what I usually end up wrestling with in other mail-order coffees, I wonder if the other stuff was unnecessarily difficult or if this was just packed the right way.<br /><br />The grounds had very mild vanilla scent, nothing like the beans you grind in the stores or even inexpensive stuff you buy in cans.  It didn't get any stronger when I brewed it.  I was afraid I hadn't used enough grounds, since I hadn't used the recommended amount (it was double what I use with my usual grounds), so I made another pot and had the same results.  While the second pot tasted better overall, it wasn't really any more  vanilla  than the first and it still had a little bit of a medicinal flavor to it.<br /><br />My recommendation if you really want a good aromatic vanilla flavor would be to stick to another brand coffee; Millstone and Melitta make good versions if you want to go the fancier route and if you're lucky and live in the area or can get it mailed to you, Steep and Brew is the best I've ever had.  Honestly, the various kinds of Folgers vanilla give better taste bang than this.
4057	5	Excellent in your coffee, great flavor, not too strong and sugar free...you can`t ask for more!!! I highly recommend to anyone using artificial sweeteners.
4058	5	This is actually the only protein drink I've tried.  My diet is sorely lacking in protein, and I thought this would be a perfect way to get more... especially since I love iced coffee.  The taste is fabulous, the vitamin & mineral count is good.  After a month of having Click for breakfast, I can really feel a difference in the way my body is functioning.  I would recommend Click to anyone who needs more protein in their diet, and is not worried about the caffeine.
4059	5	A great source of energy booster. You should have it before you hit the Gym and you will how quickly the energy booster kicks in.
4060	5	We originally bought this flour to make pizza which made EXCELLENT crust!! Also made excellent bread in my bread machine- worth the price-- esp in bulk like this
4061	5	My kids LOVED these!  They are the perfect snack for little ones!  I served them in a small bowl with a little bit of chopped fruit on the side and my kids loved it!  Don't be turned off by the fact that they are made with  Greens  they have a nice sweet flavor and your kids won't even know they they have veggies in them!  I will be ordering these again without a doubt!  Great product!
4062	5	This licorice was so good.  We've been looking for peach licorice for some time and it was great to finally find it.  The vendor sent the product quickly and it was fresh and delicious.
4063	5	My kitten is 8 months old and we've seen such a change in his coat since switching to this brand of food. Previously we fed him the Fancy Feast kitten food and he liked it but after reading horror stories about the ingredients in most commercial cat foods we decided to switch to something more natural. He loves this one too and as previsouly mentioned, we've seen such a change in his fur - softer and much shinier.
4064	4	This cat food has good, natural ingredients and is obviously grain-free.  My cats don't absolutely love it, but they like it well enough, but my cats are moderately picky eaters.  The only reason I can't give this food 5 stars is because it contains 36% protein, some argue this is ideal, but most vets I have spoken to say the higher the better (cats are carnivores, after all).  There are other brands with higher protein, but they are more expensive.<br /><br />On a note from ordering on Amazon, it was through  PetFoodDirect,  which sent me a 3.3 pound bag instead by mistake, but without any hassle they fixed the problem by sending me the correct order and letting me keep the mistake bag, so you know you are safe when ordering from them (well, you always know your safe when ordering from Amazon).<br /><br />Do the right thing! Buy better cat food like Merrick's!
4065	5	I think the makers of this granola intended to have this be cereal, but I ate it as snack. This product is delicious and lower calories than most granola. The dark chocolate gives the crunch just enough sweetness. The berries don't really add a lot of flavor. I also used this with yogurt which was yummy. I think the dark chocolate bites really preclude this from being a breakfast cereal for most adults, but I am sure some will find this much more appetizing than other grains.<br /><br />For the price, this a good value and as I said the 3.5 g of fat per serving is lower than most granola.  The manufacturer is also donating proceeds to food banks. So besides being organic, good to eat, there is also a charitable element to buying this food.<br /><br />I know I will buy more of it.
4066	5	Five pounds doesn't last that long in my house. They're that good!<br />The Jordan almonds arrived quickly and were quickly dispatched.
4067	4	Essentia tastes great. I am usually a Fiji fan, but Essentia takes the prize because of its 9.5 pH. There is no major difference that I can describe, however, there is a subtle difference. I don't know if it is just the alkylinity, but whatever the reason, I like it.<br /><br />They do sell machines that can create high pH water, but the decent ones start at $700! That makes Essentia a real bargain. Now, whether you buy into the health claims or not, well, that's a different story. Having been treated for Stage four cancer, I'm trying it, and will keep stocking it as long as I can find it. The idea that a more alkyline pH can help fight off cancer has been written up  many times, however, the validity of those claims are somewhat questionable, and until something appears in a peer reviewed medical journal (and is not funded by Essentia) it remains a matter of opinion. I will update if I find more information. As far as staying hydrated better, I don't know, and without blood tests I don't think I could tell....but like I said, it tastes good.
4068	3	I've tried a lot of stevia - not sure why this has agave or silica but then again, the last stevia I bought had lactose listed first, then stevia leaf.<br /><br />The taste is good and it dissovles fast, but I wish it was just pure stevia.
4069	1	Something about the texture of this cereal... once it's in the milk, it quickly becomes so soggy and mushy that it feels and looks like cat food. it is also very lacking in taste- it's VERY slightly sweetened and lacks the toasted aroma of other  honey toasted' cereal.  Granted, this product is probably a lot healthier.  I wish I liked it since I bought the Costco pack... and I usually LOVE other the other Kashi products (go lean crunch, energy bars), but unfortunately this cereal is not one of their best.
4070	5	I couldn't seem to find  the works  in the store. I ordered them on line and I received a case of chips in a reasonable time frame.
4071	5	I'm typically a tea drinker. After the first pot, I made coffee every day until it was gone. Would definitely recommend.
4072	5	I really like Nutiva's brand of coconut oil, it seems to be the cleanest by far.  I use this with oatmeal, and to pan fry just about anything.  It makes for amazing ham and eggs.  The only thing I don't care for is the plastic jar (yeah yeah, everyone has to watch costs) so on a hot day I will transfer mine to Ball glass jars.
4073	5	Our little cat needs to have her teeth cleaned and a tooth extracted, which means going on antibiotics for several days.  I had no luck getting the liquid in her mouth, and my efforts were causing her considerable stress.  The vet told us about pill pockets. I was skeptical because she is notoriously picky, but I didn't have any other options.  My husband got some, along with antibiotics in pill form.  We cut one in half and let her try it without a pill in it.  She LOVED it and asked for more!  We gave her the other half, and then the one with the pill in it.  SUCCESS!!  I wish I would have tried this method first, and skipped the whole fiasco with the liquid.  Wonderful product, I highly recommend it.
4074	5	I am buying this product for 2 years now, and if I am not ordering it in time....So I agree with all those people with bad experiences.My wife bakes our bread every second day.She is kneading the dough by hand, leaving it to raise than again.It becomes an enormous size bread finally, and I cant eat the publix bread no more.The secret could be the kneading, the warm weather,(Florida) or the spelt, but without this mix,it does not raise that much.So I am keep buying it.This is strictly my opinion, all the others could be right.
4075	5	Very refreshing. Plenty of fruity flavor. Thicker.... not water like consistency. Good chilled or not. Slightly sweet, milky and tart. I like the products I have tried from this company.
4076	5	This product is of high quality and tasty too. I used in on stuffed sole and the dinner guests said it was a favorite.
4077	3	I love Stacy's regular Pita Chips, but was not crazy about these.. and I am a huge cinnamon-sugar fan.
4078	1	I tested the pH of this water with reliable testing strips and it tested at 6.25 :\<br /><br />Used these:<br /><a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PDB79W >Phinex Diagnostic Ph Test Strips, 80ct -2 pack (160 strips) Results in 15 Seconds Balance Your pH today</a>
4079	5	I usually purchase this from Gevalia, but is costs more and the I usually have to wait up to ten days!! TOO LONG!!! I love this product TOO much to wait. As long as you keep this in stock I will purchase it from you!!
4080	1	I like spicy candy and wanted to try these.  The box arrived destoyed wrapped only in some plastic. (Like plastic wrap, wrapped around the box a few times) The candy is completely stale, I mean these have to be YEARS old.  They have to be thrown out.  The color is completely faded, they are rock hard, and they have a shrunken look to them.  Don't waste your money on these.
4081	5	These are given to my 2 rescue dogs at the end of the day.  They know when it is time to go out for the last time at night and sit and wait for their Greenie.  All we have to say is  do you want to brush your teeth  and they go nuts.  They love them and their teeth are in great shape...
4082	5	I love this tea.  It has a hint of citrus that is not overpowering.  It is a nice refreshing alternative to regular English Breakfast or Earl Grey.  It is not too heavy and a find it very difficult to over steep.  It can be difficult to find on grocery store shelves so I have been purchasing it through a subscribe and save membership with Amazon.
4083	3	Saw this new cereal at the grocery store for the first time yesterday and decided to try it. I have found Kashi cereals to be of high quality in the past (as well as being healthy), so I had high hopes. I just had my first bowl, and I am sorry to say that my high hopes have been dashed--at least in one major way.<br /><br />The cereal is a nice size (small bite-size), and has a nice crunch, not over-sweet, but the  kiss of berry flavor  the box promises ends up tasting like berry-scented candles, perfume or bubblebath. VERY fake-tasting. Eesh.<br /><br />Unless my tastebuds get used to the fake-tasting berry flavor, I expect this to be the last box I ever buy. Too bad, because I liked everything about it EXCEPT the fake berry taste.
4084	5	I can make some really good brownies from scratch but if you want to save time, you can't find better brownies in a box than this. Chewy, rich and moist with a crunchy crust - people who don't have to eat gluten free keep asking for them.
4085	1	The first tree looked good, but arrived with a broken pot.  I returned it without problem for a replacement.<br /><br />The leaves of the second tree were dark and drooping.  The soil was very wet.  The leaves quickly began to dry and fall from the tree.  I suspect there was some cold damage during shipment (6 days by UPS) or the soil was just too wet.  Since I've read that the Fukien Tea may loose it's leaves, I've kept the soil moist and have been waiting for it to releaf. The small branches have become brittle, so there's not much hope.  The return window is open for another two weeks.  Should the tree perk up by then, I'll provide an update.<br /><br />It would have been a nice looking tee.  I don't recommend ordering in winter.
4086	5	First, the chips arrived in perfect condition having been double-boxed by Amazon, with the outer box very sturdy.  I have share the chips with friends, and we all love them!  Very unique taste.  Highly recommend.
4087	5	Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.<br /><br />Then we tried Wellness canned food.<br /><br />Isabel loves it (but she loves anything that resembles food, so that's not a huge hurdle), but what is great about Wellness is it fills her up! And not only has she stopped constantly begging for food, she started to lose weight! Her dandruff is going away, she is no longer lethargic and has started to play again, and she generally seems like a happier cat.<br /><br />Now that her chronic UTI has finally cleared up, we give her mostly Wellness canned food with a little bit of dry food mixed in. This is still her primary source of food, and she is just as happy now as when we first made the switch.
4088	1	this item molded 7 days after opening (stored in air tight container) I would give it -10 if I could, Tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni
4089	1	Very disappointing- I usually LOVE coconut haystacks, but these were waxy cheap tasting chocolate with not enough coconut to call themselves 'haystacks'. Yuck.  Save your money and just buy a Mounds bar...
4090	5	We've been buying all flavors of Stretch Island's fruit leathers for years - raspberry is one of our favorites. These are delicious. The kids love them. And no added sugars or other ingredients. Just pure fruit in a convenient way to take it along. My diaper bag and purse always have a few in them for the kids - and me - to snack on. But I do prefer their organic ones.
4091	5	These are tbe best fruit chews I've ever had!  The flavor and texture is great.  My son had these last summer for the first time when he was at the Boy Scout Ranch, Philmont, in New Mexico.  He, of course, said this as a real treat while he was there.  I'm so glad I found them on Amazon!  Well worth the price...a great value!
4092	1	I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the  real  k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says  for Keurig K-Cup Brewers .  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however.
4093	5	Back to Nature has a hit with these crackers.  They're thin, taste great and don't have all the extra added unhealthy ingredients found in most crackers. These taste much better than wheat thins and are reasonably priced.<br />My only recommendation would be to change the inner packaging. If the manufacture is going to use a plastic bag to hold the crackers it needs to be more durable and resealable to keep the crackers fresh.  The bag inside the box tore completely, top to bottom, when opened and I had to replace it with a Ziploc storage bag to keep the crackers fresh.
4094	3	Although called Dark Roast this is more like a medium and doesn't compare with Senseo.  At the time it was ordered Senseo had been discontinued.
4095	5	This tea is very light and has a delicate flavor.  It is a VERY pleasing taste.  It tastes the way a flower smells.  This tea was my first experience with loose leaf tea, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised!  I am eager to try other flavors too!
4096	4	This appeared to be the best price around, but I still don't like paying it!  Wish my dog would eat pigs ears, but he has to have his  toothbrush .  My vet also sells these and I do trust him, so maybe  Max  knows best.
4097	5	We owned a Saeco Vienna Deluxe since January 2004, but decided to purchase a newer model in September 2010.  The Vienna Deluxe served us well for six and a half years, but was beginning to show its age.  The Saeco Vienna Plus is the updated version of the Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />Saeco's Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use.  Add up to 57 oz filtered cold water to the reservoir, up to 12 oz beans in the hopper, and then turn the machine on.  While warming up, adjust the volume dial for a 1 to 6 oz pour. Once ready, press the coffee button once to make an espresso or twice for a double shot or two espressos.  If a latte is desired, press the steam button after the espresso has finished brewing and turn the steam knob to activate the pannarello to steam the milk.  Turning the steam knob without pressing the steam button will produce hot water from the pannarello instead.<br /><br />The perfect espresso may require adjusting a couple dials in the hopper. A strength dial controls the amount of grounds used per cup.  A second knob controls the grind's coarseness. These settings are typically adjusted once then left alone if you chose to alter the factory setting.  The factory settings work well for us, so we didn't adjust these controls.<br /><br />Maintaining and cleaning the Vienna Plus espresso machine is just as simple.  Cleaning consists of a weekly (or after every 15 pucks) wipe down of the machine, rinsing off the brew group with warm water, and emptying and washing the drip tray and grounds drawer.  Incidentally, the used coffee grounds are beneficial to soil when spread out in the gardens or lawn.  Once every three months, running descaler through the boiler keeps the inner workings in good condition.<br /><br />A common complaint about Saeco Vienna espresso machines is the outer plastic cabinet.  The durable plastic cabinet was not a problem for us on the old machine, as it didn't chip, crack, or break with normal use.  The Veinna Plus uses the same plastic material for the outer cabinet, and is probably used to keep the cost down.  The internal workings, like the stainless steel boiler, are hidden from view and use more expensive materials.<br /><br />Another complaint I've read about is the grinder getting clogged.  Our local coffee shop advised us not to purchase oily beans like many flavored coffees.  If you enjoy flavored coffee, add syrup to the cup instead.  Choosing the right beans, and regular cleanings has kept us from experiencing this problem.<br /><br />Compared to the Vienna Deluxe, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine has an updated look, but operates the same and is similarly sized.  However the Vienna plus is quieter, and the pannarello has been improved for easier and more consistent frothing.<br /><br />Ultimately, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use and maintain; plus produces a great tasting espresso and Americano.  If you're looking for a fully automatic espresso machine, this one is definitely worth considering.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fresh quality coffee made at the press of a button<br />Makes consistently great tasting coffee/espresso<br />Simple to use<br />Easy to clean/maintain<br />Biodegradable waste is great for the garden<br /><br />CONS:<br />This espresso machine is sure to spoil its owners<br />Cannot handle large quantities quickly
4098	4	Love the product, but the price is now over $41.00??? I purchased this for $33.63 in February! What's going on Tinkyada?
4099	5	Cuban Style Black Beans:<br />I have prepared them  from scratch , tried more than 10 different brands in cans, and the winner is  El Ebro Black Beans Cuban Style !  Not very many groceries (outside of Latin market areas) have these, but when I find them I buy 2 or 3 cases at a time - I have friends that think these are the BEST they have ever tried (from a can).<br />I live in Ocala (Fl), and Winn Dixie here does not sell them and cannot get their warehouse to provide them, while the Winn Dixie in Marion Oaks (30 miles South of Ocala) has them on their shelves!<br /><br />If you LOVE black beans and yellow rice, get some of these El Ebro beans and some Vigo Yellow Rice.
4100	5	The cookies are a chocolate lovers dream as they are filled with soft, ooey, gooey chocolatey goodness. For chocolate lovers you will love this cookie.<br /><br />Recommend.
4101	5	My dog is a destroyer of every toy I buy her, so I was looking for something that could keep her attention and something she couldn't easily destroy. Thankfully, I found this! My dog loves it and it keeps her entertained for hours! I use Cheerio's instead of dog treats, I think its a healthier snack and its certainlly cheaper! I would definatly recommend this toy for any dog.
4102	5	This is a wonderful product. I add a teaspoon to a cup of lemonade. Adjust for your own taste. Thanks Teisseire.
4103	5	These are the best pralines that you can order. i suggest that you eat them within a week of receiving them for the freshest flavor.  Aunt Sallies are the best!!!
4104	5	This has become my favorite coffeee.  It is strong and bold without being bitter. I even make a second cup with the same puck and it is still good.
4105	5	Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee is the best!  I love the smooth, but robust taste!  I can hardly wait to smell and taste my coffee every morning!
4106	5	I bought a bunch of the powder from the company for soups. I am very happy. It seems high quality.
4107	4	I'd never tried this flavor before ordering them from Amazon, but I'm glad I did! The honey flavor isn't too sweet or overpoweing, with the cool flavor I've come to enjoy with peppermint.
4108	4	Great product. Very fresh, excellent horseradish flavor. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the shipping was a little slow, nevertheless, I will be ordering more.
4109	2	What I wanted was Lance peanut bars, and instead it showed planters peanut bars, and the wrapper looked so much alike, that I didn't even notice the brand name wasn't the same until I received it. Planters is not nearly as good a product as Lance. Guess, as with so many other things now days, if something is really good, then you can't get it anymore.<br />What a shame...
4110	5	I use these soup packets when I cook.  I have not been able to find them in the stores anymore.  What a great price too!
4111	5	I find this a much better choice than the other non-water drinks out there. I can't always get my hands on the fruits and other foods that give the antioxidants I like to get, and this is an easy and tasty way to get them. Great stuff, I always try to keep some stocked.
4112	2	Better than the non-frosted blueberry, but I'm just not a fan.
4113	1	Essential water sounded great...in theory. Just what I needed after running. After trying it, I guess i will stick to Gatorade to replenish electrolytes.<br /><br />I tried this water over several days and I have to say,  have never felt so thirsty whilst drinking so called  water . Let's start with the taste. I have tried spring water, as in 'put my hand in a spring and drink water' spring water and this can't taste any further from it. It tastes metallic and artificial at the same time. It leaves my mouth  with a horrible after taste. Not only that, after drinking it I was never dated. I have never been so thirsty after drinking water... Ever.<br /><br />The price of this is well above anything I would pay for water. At least <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NPUTSq >Vitamin Water</a> tasted good.
4114	5	I have to limit my caffeine consumption. Because I can't drink very much coffee I want the coffee I drink to be absolutely superb. A large part of my whole coffee experience is enjoying the aroma of coffee as it brews and as I inhale the steam from my cup.<br /><br />The extra fine grind of the MELITTA HAZELNUT CREME BRULEE package meant that I could use less than half the recommended amount of coffee and get a robust, strong brew. The flavor was so smooth I did not need sugar or sweetener to enhance it. I love the way this coffee smells. As I sit writing this review, I smell the wonderful aroma wafting from the kitchen and take small sips of the coffee from a mug that was a gift from a friend. This is civilization and comfort of the highest order.<br /><br />I love cream brulee. This is a great coffee that can be substituted instead of dessert, or with dessert if you must. I recommend using real cream or milk in it rather than non-dairy coffee creamer. I also recommend this coffee for breakfast as a companion to cinnamon rolls, cereal or pancakes with real maple syrup. It's great iced and would make a wonderful flavoring for homemade ice cream or milk shakes.
4115	5	I love the Fever Tree tonic water.  Try it with Tang 10 or Bombay Sapphire Gin. You will never go back to generic tonic water.
4116	5	I'd continue to buy but I'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.
4117	5	These little seeds are a tasty fuel source that provide a lasting, balanced, energy source that will sustain an active human through a vigorous workout.
4118	5	these are very flavorful fruit snacks.  My kids and i prefer them to others that have many more unhealthy ingredients.  they are pricey, but anything that says organic tends to be.
4119	5	Product was packed very well and shipped quickly. I'm very pleased and will reorder again.
4120	5	Stash teas are the best in my opinion. This flavor is amazingly tasty. Six bags brew a strong flavorful gallon. I like the fact that I save lots of money versus buying the smaller boxes in the market.
4121	5	If you have ever bought capers then you know how crazy expensive they are. These are the cheapest I could find and they don't have any noticeable taste differences when compared to the more expensive brands. I use capers in my hummus, about half a jars worth. I also use them in spaghetti sauces and ground up in mayo for a sandwich spread. If you have never had capers don't by this! Capers have a very unusual taste and not everyone likes them. They are very salty and taste kinda like a green olive but more complex. They are juniper berries so they do have that taste to them. I don't expect everyone was raised around juniper so I will just describe it as almost metallic/bitter/earthy taste.
4122	3	I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!
4123	1	These were a sore disappointment to the Nana's brand. I love the Chocolate Chip and Peanut Butter but these were way to dry and powdery. The flavor was good but the texture made my stomach turn.
4124	5	This tea is amazing!  It is great for those new to tea and enjoyed by this tea enthusiast.  The flavor of the strawberry is very true and fragrant.  I've turned on several friends to this must have tea.
4125	5	The Bahlsen Delobas are my favorite so far. Call them biscuits or call them cookies they are just plain good. Light and pastry like with a nice burst of sweetness from the red current jam. Try Them!
4126	5	The teriyaki seitan strips have great smoky/sweet barbecue taste and a nice stringy,  pulled  texture. They're full of protein and 100 calories each (I wish it were even a little less), which makes for a great snack. They dont't taste like beef jerky, but it's not supposed to. They're isolated soy-free (there's a little soy from the soy sauce in it), as the base is vital wheat gluten. I carry one in my purse all the time just in case I get hungry.
4127	4	Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other  natural  sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the  natural  paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag.
4128	5	Have been feeding this cat food to my two cats for many years now.  Couldn't find it locally after we moved but luckily found it on Amazon.  Couldn't imagine life with them if they didn't have their favorite food to crunch on.  I leave it down all the time with fresh water and I often hear them crunching during the night.  Do feed them a little canned food also to give them a little variety but they do love their Bench & Field's.
4129	5	This tea is so very delicious. It is also a beautiful ruby red and looks great served in a clear glass mug. I bought it with the idea of using it for an iced drink but found I prefer it hot. I will purchase this again.
4130	5	The items that I ordered came on time. The product is great and it worked just like the reviews stated. I will definitely use these pills again when we have another child.
4131	5	We love this coffee by Coffe Bean & Tea Leaf. Very fresh and good taste. Try their different roasts, we like them all, all that we have tried.
4132	5	This is a very healthy product that is good for your older or sickly cats, but some of mine wouldn't drink it. My Vet had previously recommended the Gerber Meats baby food as a 'supplement' for my Leukemia cat and my 15 yo cat. I decided to mix a little of the Cat Sure with a jar of the GERBER® 2ND FOODS® Meats - Chicken & Chicken Gravy, and that worked really well. Great product.
4133	2	I like hummus, but this stuff is not nearly as good as fresh. We tired of it quickly and ended up giving away most of it. Its not  bad , its just not that good, rather bland and oily.
4134	5	This is, by far, the best Collins mix on the market. I mix it with rum to make what I and my entire family enjoy as  Rum Goodies . It beats the bottled stuff hands down.
4135	5	Had been buying greenies at the pet store for the past 7 years, best price on sale was $32.99. These are a great value.
4136	5	As far as gluten free products this is awesome.  I use it as a substitute for any recipe that asks for flour.  It makes great pumpkin waffles.
4137	3	I don't care for the smell, but it works wonders to guard against breakage.  You notice a difference almost right away.
4138	3	It is a pretty good tea except they have licorice in it -- even in small amounts it is not appealing to me.<br />Raises some people's blood pressure, too, so it would be good to know this before purchasing.<br /><br />I liked it except for the licorice flavor.
4139	5	I love the fact that the gluten-free products by larabar say so right on the display box in the store so it takes the guess work out of it for you. They taste just like the flavor they're supposed to and aren't too sweet for a quick snack. They still hold you over until you can get some actual food in your stomach, which is great. I keep these around as much as I can! My favorite GF flavors are key lime pie, pecan pie, apple pie, and banana nut bread.
4140	4	This blend of Early Grey is very mild as long as you don't over brew it. It has a very subtle taste and a great blend for those who enjoy white teas. However, if it's left to brew too long, the flavor can get a little bitter, so just watch how long the tea bag sits in the cup and you'll be sure to enjoy your cup of tea.<br /><br />A great white tea that I recommend!
4141	5	This is a great dry dog food for seniors. In fact, my young dog prefers it to the Nutro Adult in the purple bag, this is so tasty. It has had a new face lift recently, new formulation, and they are even more crazy about it. The nuggets are a bit more plump and now multicolored and they do not look nearly as dry and crumbly. My dogs like it as much as ever and there has been no stomach upset from any change.<br />If you are looking for a high quality dog food that even many allergic dogs can eat, this is it. (My dog nearly died after eating one mouthful of Merrick Senior Medley, he got so sick. Other friends also report their dogs not being able to eat Merrick in wet or dry because of allergies.) If you are looking for a great senior food, this will keep your older pet looking slim and trim provided you follow the instructions on the bag. (As a side note, the canned food is also very good, but unfortunately, really not good value compared with the dry, and compared with other brands of canned, just as Natural Balance and Natural Balance Limited Ingredient.)<br />After the latest food recall, I also just want to remind people to always wash their hands before and after feeding their dog. It should be common sense but sadly it is not.  Salmonella abounds and while it will not usually harm a pet, it can harm humans. I love this food because it is so wholesome for my pets and so safe. 30lb bag is great value too.
4142	2	These cookies taste great, but they arrived a crumbly mess.  Every cookie in all three packages was damaged in some way.  The packaging is also awful for keeping them fresh.  They were stale within days.
4143	4	My dog likes to suck off the brown meat flavored part in the twist and then leaves the remainder for the dust bunnies under my bed. Even still, I'll continue buying these as he seems to truly love them (or part of them) and it's about 2.00 less on amazon than what the local pet store has them for. Shame they don't have just the brown meaty part as a treat itself. :)
4144	3	This is a powder drink mix that you can add to your water bottle. (Each packet is meant to be added to 16.9 fl oz of water.) I think it tastes okay, but it is more like juice than tea. I don't really taste the green tea part. It reminds me of the Celestial Seasonings herbal teas. I tried the drink both cold and hot, and it tastes fine either way. The powder doesn't dissolve as readily in cold water but stirring helped. The only thing I don't like is that even though it claims to be only 5 calories without using aspartame, I noticed that there is sucralose in the ingredients list. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener used in sweeteners such as Splenda, and I've never liked the taste of it.
4145	5	This pancake mix is excellent, if you are looking for a wheat pancake, that is light and fluffy, look no further. The combination of wheat and oat flour, makes this pancake mix, one of the best! I gifted Kodiak Cakes Mix, this past Christmas, with a wooden spoon & spatula...there were smiles all around.
4146	5	This was one of my freebies from registering my Tassimo and boy did I choose a good one.  There were a lot of good reviews on this flavor, so I didn't doubt that it was tasty, but after only a week I'm pretty well addicted to the Caramel Macchiato flavor, so I wasn't sure that I'd enjoy a Latte lacking the caramel.  Well, this is wonderful in its own right.  Jacobs espresso is good and smooth, not burnt or harsh tasting.  The creamer is sweet enough with not being sickening and yields a nice foamy top.  I added about a teaspoon of sugar to this, but it is definitely delicious enough without this addition.<br /><br />If you're into aesthetics, use a clear mug for this one because you truly do get the layered effect that is pictured on the package.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of this.  I would consider this variety in my top 3 for the Tassimo.  Give it a try, if you haven't yet!  Cheers :)
4147	5	I love Wrigley's Extra Polar Ice gum, because it's soft and easy to chew. The flavor is very robust, and lasts a long time. I also chew this gum when flying. For some reason, I have the most success with this gum when descending in the plane. Some things just can't be explained.....all I know is that I love this gum, and you will too.
4148	4	I use 3 bags for 2 quarts and my family loves this tea. Not too sharp and never as bitter as some of the other teas are. Remember to add sugar while the tea is still hot to keep it crystal clear (if you like sweet tea)  I make it in the evening to enjoy the next day.
4149	1	I recieved this item in the mail and the bottle top was loose and had leeked inside the packing. The bottle label was wet and unreadable. The seal on the top was intack, but it still leeked. The company ( Fee Brothers) needs alot better quality control................
4150	5	Love these, find that I am now using them in everything I cook....salads, fish and meat sauces..esp. in pasta sauces and sprinkled on my rice dishes as well.....I love the salty, savory taste....almost like using anchovies--another fav of mine. Love the autoship..<br /><br />btw--these bottles recycle perfectly into herb and spice jars...PERFECTLY.
4151	5	This is one of my favorite flavors of green tea, and I was very happy to find it on Amazon when my local Walmart stopped carrying it.<br /><br />It's got a nice  peach skin  essence flavor to it (easy to taste the peach flavor), and the green tea can get a nice strong flavor if you leave it in there for quite awhile.<br /><br />The tea bags are also individually packaged in foil lined packages, which probably keep the tea fresher, longer (with no light or excess air).<br /><br />It's a very nice, enjoyable green tea with a little honey!
4152	5	This product is everything the Elana's Pantry websie said it would be.  This flour is a MUST for anyone on the Primal Blueprint program.  Buy the 5 Lb bag - it is definitely needed when you're baking for family and friends.
4153	5	This is a really good alternative to the non-dairy creamers in the grocery store.  very good. sugar free very tasty too
4154	4	My dogs are absolutely in love with Wholesome Hide products.  It is the only brand we let them have though...  It took longer than I expected for this product to ship and the packaging was really leaving a lot to be desired (a torn up garbage bag inside a box.)  They were a deal compared to the other store that I buy these bones from, but I'm going back to the other store for the better shipping time and packaging care.
4155	5	36 Petit Fours for $10.50 is outrageous!! What a super deal!! I had been looking for months for Petit Fours, it was great that Amazon and Swiss Colony could make it happen.  The product arrived in a very timely matter and in perfect condition.  My tea party was a big hit with these dessert favorites.  I plan on ordering them again if I can find this same bargain.
4156	5	This tea is stronger than I am used to, so it takes less teabags to make tea. I use about half the usual amount of teabags I used to use to make my Georgia Sweet Tea! I love the flavor of this tea, and it saves money using less.
4157	5	After reading about Holly's Oatmeal online, I went to her website to order some.  There I found I could order it through Amazon.  First, I tried the assorted flavors so I could sample each one.  They were all delicious.  I finally decided to stay with the Wickedly Plain Oatmeal because I like to add blueberries and walnuts to my oatmeal.  If you are an oatmeal fan, this is for you.  Such a good flavor and so full of nutrition.  It is more costly than other brands of oatmeal, but, oh, so much better.  I have given friends boxes to try and everyone asks where they can get some.  Six boxes at a time may seem like a lot, but they have good code dates and disappear quickly.
4158	2	I thought I was ordering the plain Golden Treasures Butter Toffee. What I received were the flavored butter toffee, they are good, but my favorites are the just butter toffees.
4159	5	I have a lot of trouble with sugar free gum- I hate the taste of artificial sweeteners. This gum has a powerful initial lime punch and the flavor lasts a long time. When they discontinued carrying this at my local store, I came to amazon to buy in bulk. I hope it will be available forever!
4160	5	My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem.
4161	3	There are 24 little boxes contain roughly ten small lemon heads a box, The price was far too high for what you get, and the product was overheated and candy had often been melted together.
4162	5	Green Mountain Dark Magic is delicious coffee! I love starting my day off with this coffee. I highly recommend you try this coffee.
4163	5	My family loves this product. I cook with and it taste great. I use it on my body and also on my haisr. It is a great product.
4164	4	I ordered these to see how they would ship because I wanted to order them as gifts. It is mid-March, upstate NY, so it's pretty cold here now. Most of the candies arrived in a semi-melted state or most of them were broken or crushed. They are wonderful snacks, but I think they need to be purchased directly from a store and not sent through the mail.
4165	5	I was very skeptical about what a low carb tortilla would taste like but it is amazingly good.  Great texture and doesn't fall apart when you're eating it.  I prefer these now over regular tortillas.
4166	1	I have been on an Indian food kick lately. The local Indian restaurant is quite expensive so I decided to try this sauce as a cheaper option. I am thoroughly disappointed with its flavor. It has way too much vinegar, probably to help preservation. I couldn't even take more than one bite. I would not recommend this sauce at all.
4167	4	I agree with the reviewer who said it won't give you 100% the firmness of jello but it does satisfy my cravings!  Wonderful product!
4168	5	I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.
4169	2	This used to be my favorite coffee type for my tassimo coffee maker, however, the current deliveries have been slightly bitter and not pleasant for my taste.  I wonder what Gevalia has changed in the product?
4170	5	My cat seems to enjoy this and her coat is shiny and she seems happy.<br /> It arrived super fast like 3 days and wow what a relief, that I didn't have to pick it up, have a bad back and can't lift over 5lbs.<br />so I buy large bags and buy them here or [...] and some others whom ever has free shipping and the best price<br />worth it not to mess up my back...<br /> Such a convience
4171	2	I've got a mini-Aussie/Blue Heeler mix, so she's a small/medium-sized dog at 25 lbs. She managed to chew the toy up in 20 minutes. So if you're dog's a strong chewer, don't waste your money! Great for dainty chewers, though, like my Corgi.
4172	3	Box was opened at the perforations and was only 23 in the box, thief amazon worker took one. Makes me think twice about ordering grocery items. Bright side is one less candy for me to get fat on.
4173	5	This coffee is as big and bold as Emeril himself.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites of all time with the Keurig, it makes a fantastic full bodied cup of coffee without the typical burnt or overly bitter taste normally associated with dark roasted coffees.<br /><br />When brewed an immediate wonderful coffee aroma will fill your kitchen and it develops a very light caramel colored froth that hugs the edge of your cup or mug.<br /><br />A major pick me up, Big Easy Bold holds up to the largest brew sizes and makes a delicious full flavor cup for travel mugs where ordinary K-cup coffees normally become watered down.<br /><br />Brew a small size, top with the froth of scalded milk and you will have the best cappuccino replica you ever tasted at home.<br /><br />Big Easy Bold is best to sit for a brief moment after brewing before adding sugar or another sweetener as the initial  bite  of the coffee quickly mellows into deep rich flavors. I found myself at first adding too much sugar and finding the coffee a tad too sweet a minute later as the flavors settled into one great cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you love rich, full bodied cups of coffee you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If breakfast blends and watery medium roasts are boring you, kick your cup up a notch, give it a try and fall in love with your coffee again.
4174	2	I've come to that conclusion. I don't know whether it's the milk itself or the plastic container which influences it, but the milk pods just make the coffee untasty to me.  This was was heavily milk-laden, and so did not set well with me.
4175	1	I was not at all satisfied with the quality of the walnuts. The taste and<br />particularly the texture were poor. I expected a better quality and was very<br />disappointed with the product.
4176	5	Our kids just love these all natural fruit snacks. We would buy the regular fruit snacks in the store with all the sugar and the kids would bounce off the walls. These are so much better for them. With the subscribe and save program it is so nice to just have them shipped to the house.
4177	5	My adult daughter is  into  saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea  the old fashioned way .  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.
4178	4	My nearly 16 year old cat takes meds daily and these have been a life saver.  I thinks she's figured out that after she takes the treat she gets her breakfast, so I rarely have trouble getting her to take it.  Wish I'd had this years ago for another difficult kittie!  We recommend them highly.
4179	5	I rescued a cat not long ago and have had a hard time getting him to come out from under my sofa. When offered about four other kinds of treats he turned up his nose, these were the only treats that would get him out from under the couch! They must taste good!
4180	1	I USED TO LOVE THIS TEA WHEN IT WAS CALLED  WHITE TEA  made from peony and had a plain tea taste but now it is WHITE PEONY and has a floral taste.<br />I don't like it now and am annoyed that Choice seem to have discontinued the old tea.
4181	1	Purchased this coffee because I enjoy vanilla and coffee, and enjoyed a previously purchased bag of Starbucks ground coffee. It sounded good, but I was wrong. It just tastes like bad coffee. There's no vanilla in there anywhere. This would be fine if it still tasted alright, but I feel sad for wasting my money on this product.
4182	5	My dog loves the taste of these treats.  They have glucosamine in them which is why i tried them.  He can't get enough of them.
4183	1	I love my Keurig, and use it several times a day. These K-Cups were the worst I have tasted. Grove square is one of the few brands that, for there coffee, uses a mix of micro ground and instant coffee. But since this review is for their apple cider, I will briefly tell you my opinion. The Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider is by far one of the worst drinks I have ever made in my Keurig. It hardly is apple cider. For Thanksgiving most of my family tried it and none of them even finished their cups. I will never buy any Grove Square product again. I have heard that Green Mountain Apple Cider is much better and I am sure would be worth buying.
4184	5	I have to eat gluten-free to stay healthy, but the rest of my family doesn't.  My boyfriend of many years, actually asks for this pasta and really enjoys it.  And, we've found that this pasta cooks almost exactly the same as regular pasta, but for any recipe that uses the  pasta water  as an ingredient, this pasta actually makes a really good pasta water and the end product is PERFECT.  (Using pasta water incorporates some of the liquid and primarily the starches that boil off of the pasta into the sauce you are making).  We love this pasta and eat it at least once a week, if not more.  This is my preferred brand of gluten-free pasta.
4185	5	We have been using this to make cinnamon popcorn.  The Pure Cinnamon Oil 4 oz. is perfectly strong and it is essential to follow directions or only add a couple of extra drops at a time to obtain your ultimate flavor level.<br />Now I am seeking a Vanilla extract in the same league as this Pure Cinnamon Oil 4 oz.
4186	5	the taste the taste the taste is gonna move ya!  I remember that catchy little jingle back in the 80's when I was young and watching morning cartoons and Alf.  It's a perfect melody for a wonderful and sunny girl-chasing day on the surfboard!  Back then we didn't realize how silly such a song is.  Nowadays such innocent stupidity has been replaced by... a man in a dance competition and attempting to win a Klondike bar (and winning with the confetti raining down... yikes is that ever awful).<br /><br />Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Gum is addicting.  If it wasn't for the poor state of my teeth and my dentists highly recommended wishes to avoid sugary foods, I'd be chewing this stuff all the time.  Actually it hurts when I chew gum for several minutes at a time these days... so I probably wouldn't.  I guess the jingle is right- the taste is gonna move me all the way to the dentists office and a monthly 100-dollar bill.<br /><br />Anyway, this is probably my favorite gum flavor-wise.  My teeth may not like it, my dentist may not like it, but the sugar Gods above shine down with a smile whenever I chew it so at least I could appease somebody.
4187	2	My favorite pretzels in the world are Ener-g sesame pretzel rings-light and crispy and with seeds on the pretzels. Thought I was buying those,only in a bigger package.These are hard and dry-not crispy-dry!and must be made with ground sesame seeds because I can't find a seed on any of them.Next time will read description and check picture better.
4188	5	Stash is my favorite tea, and by far the Moroccan Mint is my favorite flavor.  I love mint, and the mix of green tea and mint is just delcious.
4189	5	I bought this for my hubby, he loves dark rich coffee & Dark Magic offers it. Great convenience of the Kcup makes it that much nicer.
4190	5	I used this repellent at the end of May in Louisiana. My friends got bitten profusely, and I didn't even have a scratch.<br /><br />I get bitten a lot and also am allergic to bites, so am always looking for something strong enough to protect me.<br /><br />This product actually smells quite pleasant, is a cream so does not dry out your skin, and 100% actually works. I also didn't have to reapply once I'd put it on in the evenings.<br /><br />I would say it doesn't last too long as it's quite a small bottle, but it can probably be put on more sparsely than I did.
4191	5	Taste will be different for everyone, for me this is as good as Starbucks French Roast and better tasting than Black Tiger and the price can't be beat.
4192	5	Good product!<br /><br />Good presentation.  Not crazy about the  >$1  price per package ... but if you don't have access to one of the few stores which sell the Chiclets packages right now, this Amazon price will do.  (Fancy brands in grocery stores are $3.50, where these are $1.00.)  (So far, I find at Dollar Tree, and Big Lots.) I had hoped for more flavors among the return of Chiclets; but it seems only the two... Fruit and the Peppermint.  I confess I'd not remembered the gum lately.  But, when the new (expensive!) plastic tubs of gum in loose pieces became popular -- it reminded me of Chiclets.<br /><br />The cross-section population who comes and goes at my office via the Delivery Door where I sit, has chosen its favorite-- CHICLETS, FRUIT Flavor, even more-often than the intense mint options.  I'm thankful, as it saves me a lot of money while I keep all manner of visitors happy.   I'm doing some things right:  the gum helps to keep our office on the good-list with every brand of couriers!   I deposit the chiclets into one of those tubs for distribution.  Each gum is not individually wrapped (like are my other favorite, Life Savers) but the  pour  method for the gum, still helps to reduce the degree of germ-sharing.
4193	2	This has a really nice flavor and is not  too carbonated but it did absolutely nothing to my energy level! This is the first time I have tried a product like this. I tried it because I work nights and wanted a little energy boost to help get me through  til quitting time!  I think a little extra caffiene will work and be less expensive.
4194	4	I've been using this coffee for several years and I am quite satisfied.  For a decaf, it is rich and satisfying, a robust taste for the early morning.  One of the best decaf coffees I've tasted.
4195	4	I was pleasantly surprised at these little snacks.  Thought sure they wouldn't fill me up, but they did.  Had just the right amount of crunch and a hint of cinnamon flavor that was not overpowering or bitter.
4196	2	While it didn't taste too bad, it was really hard to get past trying to drink the chunks.<br />My daughter usually loves green tea, but she couldn't drink it either because the chunks just grossed her out too much.  Sorry....
4197	5	I use this mix on a regular basis.  Both my daughter and I are gluten intolerant so we are always on the lookout for great tasting GF products.  This mix makes a great sugar cookie,in fact, when I brought some for a party at my daughter's school, kids preferred my cookies to the other sugar cookies brought.  This also makes an excellent chocolate chip cookie.
4198	5	This is the third storage unit I have purchased for keiurig coffee pod storage, and it is a toss-up between the 36 pod storage drawer or the 54 storage drawer.  I find this one to be compact and a good storage option for the coffee pods with each drawer holding 18 pods.
4199	5	These eggs changed my life. For many years, I hated eggs. Eggs made me literally sick to even look at. Oftentimes I would see an egg and consider ending my own life. Then one day, a brown package from Amazon.com arrived on my doorstep. I opened it to find a friend had ordered for me these perfectly ovular, smooth, pearly white eggs. I could immediately see that there was something special about them. Handling them as carefully as porcelain china, I carried them into my kitchen and hesitantly cracked one over my skillet. With a little milk, a pinch of salt and pepper, a sprinkle of cheese, and a touch of love, these small, simple eggs were without question the best things I have ever tasted in my life. I am literally addicted to these eggs. I eat at least one for every meal.<br /><br />Whoever would even consider writing a poor review of these eggs obviously has no palette and no intelligence whatsoever. They should truly consider reevaluating their life.<br /><br />Thank you, eggs.<br />And thank you, reader, for taking the time to listen to the inspiring story of how these eggs saved my culinary life and supplied me with enough protein to make it through the day.
4200	4	I love chocolate covered pretzels, and these are pretty good. The chocolate is above average quality for covered pretzels, but there isn't a heavy coating, which is a minus in my book. It's easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting.<br /><br />I have tried the dark chocolate variety but found those to be pretty tasteless, the milk chocolate definitely complements the pretzels. If they would just add a bit more chocolate coating they would get 5 stars.
4201	5	PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down. The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy. The calories and fat are very low. No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip. You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem. But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the  popping,  but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!
4202	5	I imagine the people giving this product low ratings either a. don't have clothes moths and expect it to catch all kinds of moths, b. didn't actually put the pheromone in the trap (you have to open the package and drop it in that hole in the top), or c. didn't read the package to see this only traps the MALE clothes moths and does not kill the larva which is what actually eats your clothes.<br /><br />First off, the type of moths that eat your clothes are very very small and very very fast. They also hate light so they are very hard to just spot. Most of the times I've seen them have been when I was watching TV in the dark and one fluttered by the front of the TV or I've found them hiding in cracks in my closet.<br /><br />I had a serious moth infestation in my clothes. I sorta ignored it until they ate about 10 of my sweaters. They were literally in shreds. When I threw all the wool clothes away they started eating the cotton stuff as well (although not as successfully) so I decided to get these traps because I didn't want to use poisons or whatever. They did a good job of trapping a lot of moths but like the packaging says, these basically will ALERT you that you have a problem they aren't going to totally solve it.<br /><br />Eventually I threw away a lot of old clothes and then washed everything else all at once and put anything wool into plastic bags. The moths WILL attempt to eat your cotton stuff but they don't tend to be as destructive to it (you'll see the cocoons on the clothes but they won't be all full of holes like the wool stuff) Vacumming in your closets will also help get rid of them. I then put cedar chips in my closet. Not quite sure how useful that is but I have definitely slowed them down and haven't seen any more destruction since.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo of one of my traps that caught about 20 moths to prove these do work. Just realize to get rid of your problem you're going to have to do more than just get these traps.
4203	5	My adult daughter is  into  saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea  the old fashioned way .  She realized with the first brewed cup that loose tea has a much fresher, intense flavor than teas in a bag. I doubt that she will go back to using tea bags again and will probably research and request more Stash tea products in the future.
4204	5	I am on a restricted diet, so these popchips was something I was eager to try.  I am always on the lookout for healthy alternatives to snacking - these were neither fried nor baked (although I will gladly eat a baked chip over a fried potato chip) - popped chips... they reminded me somewhat of Pringles, except the salt content was much lower and not that greasy either.  And, using sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes caught my eye as well.<br /><br />I loved these popchips.  They are slightly sweet and definitely quenches my need for a snack in the middle of the day.  I've seen these at my local Sprouts (not just in sweet potato flavor but other choices as well) and recommend them.  I think it's wonderful to see different types of alternative ways to healthy snacking available to the consumer.
4205	5	I'm not much of a tea person, but this stuff is incredible (Chamomile citrus in particular).  It's pricey, but worth it.  The teabags themselves are a work of art.  The deal here on Amazon is also great: it works out to less than half the price of my local market on a per teabag basis.<br /><br />I drink a cup every night before bed and fall asleep like a baby.
4206	4	I made these pancakes today before heading to work for my family.  My husband said they are the best pancakes I've ever made.  They were super easy to make and tasted great.  Looking forward to making more and adding some extra ingredients in there.  I also want to try out the waffles.
4207	4	It's Cholula if you like Cholula a lot then you will like half a gallon of cholula even more. I bought this for a bachelor friend's birthday about six months ago. He loved it. Unfortunately the pump lid was cracked. This didn't affect the pump's working but was still bothersome. If you want to have half a gallon of Cholula that you can pump into your food buy this.
4208	5	Every time I open a can, my cat meows like CRAZY... He always thinks it's one of these... Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. So whenever I have soup or whatever, I give him one of these. This is the only kind of food that I KNOW he likes. And it keeps him healthy. I can tell when cat food isn't that good for him. He sheds a little more. But I don't have that problem with this and the other cat food I'm giving him now.
4209	4	While I love dogs and want them to have good lives, I still balk at the idea of actually TASTING their food.  That makes it tough to review dog food.  I'm not a nutrition expert...all I can do is comment on my personal experience.<br /><br />First of all, Beneful dog food smells better than MANY popular dog foods.  That is a BIG plus in my book.  If smell is a decent indicator of how appetizing something might be to eat, then I would say Beneful must taste pretty good to the dog.  Any the dog loves it (as much as any dog who occasionally gets human food scraps can  love  dog food).  He always sniffs it with interest when presented, and eats it with gusto when he's ready to eat.  When he decides its time to dig in, he'll polish off his bowl.  That's a pretty good indicator to me.  I think Beneful is a good compromise between your standard  Dog Chow  and the much more expensive items you see in speciality pet stores.  It is just a little more expensive than the  common  stuff, but if you can't afford the price of the top tier food...I think Beneful makes a great alternative for something a bit more flavorful and which (based on information provided, not any  scientific research  on my part) has a bit more concern for providing your pooch with a well balanced diet.<br /><br />I think if you've not tried it, it is WELL worth seeing what your dog things.
4210	5	This pod is great! It has a nice nutty rich flavor and is not weak like many other pods. Its also a big pod, I have to use my 2 pod holder in my senseo for just 1 of the Blasts.<br />I will say this is not weak coffee but its not kick you in your teeth strong coffee either, for me its the perfect strength.
4211	4	Just a sweet little 30 calorie treat to satisfy your craving for candy.  The hint of salt makes this all natural lollipop a winner in my book!
4212	5	Purchasing this coffee was definatly worth it! Not only is it not that expensive but it tastes wonderful! Although you get 50 I had to purchase another box because my husband and I liked it so much.
4213	3	What can I say. The lack of calories is good. This is the latest fad on sweeteners.  Let's just hope it doesn't cause cancer down the line.
4214	5	I opened these because I was hungry but once I took the first bite I knew this was a slow chewer. Very moist and flavorful jerky with a vivid and accurate teriyaki flavor. The product arrived quickly and well packaged.
4215	5	This is a wonderful alternative to rice. It is easy to make. I use the microwave instructions. I used to buy it in the local grocery stores. But I haven't been able to find it. By chance I found it on Amazon and because there was no shipping cost, it cost the same as I used to spend in the store. I love this and it is healthy and high in fiber. My kids even love it.
4216	1	I received the offer from Amazon and had never tried this brand before.  I thought since Martinson's had been in business for a long time that I would order.  I was disappointed.  The flavor was not what I expected and each cup of coffee had a residue in it. I have not had any of the other brands do that so I know it had to be the coffee.  I am guessing that the coffee was ground to fine for a K-Cup.  I only have 8 more left and will be glad.  I will not buy this brand again.
4217	5	I have been brewing a large container of tea and chill it for ice tea.  It is great just the way it is but you can add sweetner if you like.
4218	5	Who would've thought a snack that is not bad for you, could taste so good.  Both my husband and I really enjoy these.
4219	4	The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better.
4220	5	I purchased Greenmax  Chinese Yam and Multi Grains Rice  from an oriental market in Houston.  This one does not say it includes yams and the bag is different, but the grains look the same in the picture.  The one I purchased was absolutely delicious!!  It included: oatmeal, Kaoliang rice, pearl barley, fox nut, wheat, oat, flat red bean, rice, pearl rice, yam.  I cook it in the crock pot overnight (1:3 grains to water ratio, in a bowl set in a water bath in the crock pot); this way they cook perfectly and are ready to eat in the morning.  :)
4221	1	I usually don't write reviews, but this coconut water was nowhere near the quality of their normal product.  I would not drink these if they were free.  Very disappointing.
4222	5	I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face...BADLY and didn't want to way 4-5 days for my order to process on here. So I purchased it (and I cringed at the thought of spending 15 bucks on a small container of moisturizer), and applied it to my clean face in the morning and before bed. Let me tell you...<br /><br />THIS THING ZAPPED MY PIMPLES LIKE NO TOMORROW!!!<br /><br />Not only did it feel nice and silky on my face, and it soaked in, but it just cleared my face up! I was so surprised. I thought it was too good to be true and maybe it happened to be one of those days that my skin decided to clear uyp on it's own. But no, I was wrong... and thank goodness. I continued using the moisturizer twice a day for a week and my face just stayed clear for the entire week. I was so happy!<br /><br />This stuff is definitely worth the money, and it WILL last you quite a long time since a little DOES go a long way. How little you ask? Just lightly, and quickly tap your finger onto the surface of the moisturizer and that's all you'll really need!<br /><br />Five stars, baby. FIVE STARS!
4223	3	I'm surprised to see all those 5-star reviews. I bought these mixes directly from Hodgson Mill. The first time we made it the bread was very heavy and not very sweet. The second time I added some sugar but we still didn't enjoy the very dense texture. What to do with all those other boxes?  We bought a box of another brand of gingerbread mix (which would probably have been too sweet on its own) and combined the two and it came out fine. I'm an experienced baker so I don't think I did anything wrong - with such simple instructions there isn't much you can make a mistake on but it's been a while so maybe they've changed the formula a bit.
4224	5	I had the EREWHON Crispy Brown Rice with Salt and the one with no Salt both Equally Good, got them from Amazon.com, several boxes made all kinds of Treats like Rice Krispies with Marshmallows, then I got this one EREWHON Organic Crispy Brown Rice Cereal Gluten Free, Well...I can't tell the difference they all taste Great to me, sometimes I eat it with Milk and I like to make Treats with it, like Peanut Butter Energy Bars and Granola that I use for Toppings and to give away. It's all Organic and made from Whole Grains it doesn't Taste Stale and Funky like other Cereals loaded with sugar, ...EREWHON Cereals are all Good! Thank You
4225	5	Ginger chews are such an amazing thing. Ginger helps nausea of all sorts (including those caused by chemo and motion sickness), heartburn and I have heard even menstrual cramps and other ailments. While fresh ginger can be very strong, these are slightly calmer, with a bit of sweetness. They are portable and come individually wrapped which are great for travelling. I love ginger chews and The Ginger People!!!
4226	5	WE ENJOY FEEDING OUR DOGS THIS GREAT FOOD AND IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT IT ISN'T FILLED WITH FILLERS OR BY-PRODUCTS, WHATEVER THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE!I KNOW WE DON'T THINK BY-PRODUCTS ARE SOMETHING THAT BELONGS IN OUR PETS FOOD.I BELIEVE BY-PRODCTS ARE SOMETHING LEFT OVER AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN PROCESSED! I LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE ARE FEEDING OUR ANIMALS FOOD GRADE MEALS THAT ARE GOOD FOR THEM. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
4227	5	I've tried different products and this is the first product that actually tastes like milk.  The price is better than anything on the current market for the amount of product you receive.  I will not buy anything else anymore.
4228	5	I am a faithful Tassimo fan, and Swiss Hazelnut has become my favorite coffee. The aroma alone is worth it.<br /><br />I am equally ecstatic about Amazon's very intelligent packaging, which I hope will set a trend for traditional retailers as well. Now that I am getting older and crankier, I get very angry when I return home from WalMart or Target, only to find that both my mental and physical health are jeopardized when I try, for example, to open a blister pac of batteries.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon, for doing what is environmentally right, for making shopping easy, and for avoiding the very real insult to honest consumers embodied in anti-theft packaging that requires our time, effort, and physical well being.
4229	5	I am a calorie counter and I ordered this product along with Heinz blackberry jam in 0.5 oz. Perfect size for morning toast, no measuring or cleaning up afterwards.
4230	4	I found this tea at Oleana, an excellent Turkish restaurant in Cambridge, MA. At dinner, everyone at the table wanted a sniff of my apple tea, so I passed the glass around. Most found the sniff delightful, so they also drained a sip.  The glass came back nearly empty.  Fortunately, the pot was very large.  I'm a tea drinker; this is not Camellia sinensis, nor meant to be. Nevertheless, I found it in its own way subtle and quite delicious.
4231	5	It is great! I like it alot. Great price too. I think it is delicious. Top quality product in my opinion.
4232	5	This maple syrup is delicious and so flavorful -- Did you know grade B maple syrup has so many vitamins and minerals you could almost not feel guilty about having french toast for breakfast. I also try and use maple syrup where I can for sweetener instead of sugar. The company was wonderful about the shipping and the product arrived packaged well and on time! Enjoy.
4233	2	The name of this product is  Disney Cars 8 Re-Useable McQueen & Tow Mater Rings .  However, the Product Features and Product Description sections both state there are 12 rings in the pack.  Specifically, there are 6 McQueen and 6 Mater rings.  I just received this product and there are only 8 rings in the pack; 3 McQueen, 3 Mater and 2 WGP.  Hopefully, I will be able to reorder more rings and get them here before my son's birthday party at school on Tuesday.  The features and description sections need to be corrected to the reflect the actual product being sold!!!
4234	5	Love these chips. They taste great and I love knowing I'm getting in my grains while eating something that tastes good.
4235	5	Product was delivered well packed. Smell and flavor are excellant. Didn't expect the product before we needed it, but it arrived by priority mail in days.
4236	5	If you are looking for that stuff full of sugar and corn syrup, this is not what you want. This is pure, clean, water and mint, period. Spectacular!
4237	5	The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor.
4238	5	Perfect tasting water! I have a reverse osmosis system under my kitchen sink, so I know how good, clean water should taste and this Essentia definitely tastes pure. I can say that I did feel better hydrated first thing in the morning drinking this instead of my water.<br /><br />It tastes MUCH better than the majority of bottled waters out there that are little more than tap water. This is a thousand times better tasting than tap water. Essentia has no smell and no aftertaste. I will be using this before my morning workouts from now on.
4239	4	I love this litter, in theory-- it is dust free, keeps the smell to a minimum, and is natural.  And, this litter was EXCELLENT for my old girl who urinated a lot.  The litter is fantastic at trapping the ammonia smell that I hate so much, and it slowly broke down as she continued to use it..  But, my younger kitty wanted NOTHING to do with this litter, no matter how slowly I tried to transition her over.  I'm not sure if she doesn't like the texture on her feet (I probably wouldn't either) or the fact that it's harder to dig in because the pellets are a different shape/heavier, or what.  But, I'd recommend giving it a try to see if you have any luck with your cats.  The health benefits, and how cost effective it is, are worth giving it a shot.  (As an aside, I would not consider this in any way a  clumping  litter like the product description says...)
4240	5	I really love this coffee, and my co-workers do too. All of them were so impressed at how smooth, non-acidic, yet full-bodied this is.  I've tried pretty much all the different T discs, and this is still my favorite. Try it, I'm sure you'll be pleased!
4241	5	My husband and his family like to avoid gluten, so these are a great choice.  We have a hard time finding them locally, so ordering them online is great.  Our young kids like them, too.
4242	2	Have 2 Shelties..good eaters but at times a little picky on their dry kibble..thought this might spark it up a little...wrong..they don't like the smell or taste..tried it on our 3 cats (they eat anything)..not for them either..I tasted it (hey, if they can eat it I should be able to at least taste it)..not for me either...8 unopened bottles going somewhere.......
4243	5	I am just now getting into teas. I have had herbal teas in the past and they all tasted the same (to me) like drinking grass. Yuck! I recently bought this tea and can honestly say that I like it and will buy more. I personally add a little milk and some Stevia sweetener.  I also like the Jasmine tea they make.
4244	1	Sure, you get a lot of grains.  But, they fail to provide a creamy, yogurt product.  The milk curdles and seperates, but then, even after stirring does not produce a thick yogurty texture.  The grains are useless.  Buy from Life Time Kefir instead.  I have a whole bunch of grains from this supplier and nothing more than curdled very sour milk.
4245	1	This is not a review of the chips themselves, they are really wonderful.<br /><br />This is a review of the seller, Liquid Nation, with whom I had a terrible experience when buying these chips through them.<br /><br />Although it appeared that they had the 9oz packages in stock, I got a message from them saying they had bigger bags in stock instead and I accepted.<br /><br />However, when I received the package, almost all the bags were expired, some for MONTHS!!!<br /><br />I have contacted the seller and they have ignored the issue and did not take care of it.<br /><br />BEWARE OF LIQUID NATION!
4246	5	They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside, the entire contents are meant to be used (unlike the coffee Kcups) so it will feel empty once done. I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.<br /><br />Also, kids may not like the peppermint flavor.... But that is my favorite one. If you don't want to get the variety pack, they sell the individual flavors too.
4247	3	I've been a fan of the original Starbucks VIA Colombian since its release, and had been keeping a close eye on my local retailer for the flavored varieties to be released, which they have inexplicably stocked roughly two weeks before the release date.<br /><br />The notably larger and heavier packages are sold alongside the original VIAs, featuring only six servings per pack. VIA fans will note the  lightly sweetened  remark on the front of the box, along with the addition of cane sugar in the ingredients list. The packaging is otherwise nearly identical to the standard VIAs, so you'll have to look closely to notice it.<br /><br />Mocha VIA dissolves quickly, much the same way as the original VIAs, but with a slightly milky hue. The mocha-coffee aroma is present, but the actual flavor of the coffee differs notably from the smell; both the coffee and mocha components are low-grade, with the sugar element coming in quite strong ( lightly sweetened  means the same thing here as it does with Iced VIA - almost as sweet as soda.) The overall impression is office-quality bitter coffee with some condiment chocolate powder thrown in and a remarkably heaping spoon of sugar.<br /><br />This does not mean that Mocha VIA is useless; part of what made the original VIAs so popular was how many different ways they could be used in mixed drinks (VIA dissolves in cold water/milk/etc as well as hot), and I would wager that over time, there will be a sizable list of unique mix recipes for these flavored varieties as well. But without those recipes, most Starbucks fans who expect a rather complex quality blended coffee drink will be disappointed by trying to drink this straight.
4248	5	Just made my first latte with this espresso and it is EXCELLENT - smooth, NOT bitter at all, rich, dark, roasted, chocolate notes. I will never use Starbucks espresso again! Definitely purchase this item.
4249	5	My daughter wanted the wax bottles and the only place I could find them was at Amazon. My daughter really likes these so I'm glad was able to find them.
4250	5	I use a combination of Pennery's New Mexico and Gebhardt's in my chili. I think the combination produces a very smooth Chili.  Remember to add 1TBS more of both about 30 minutes before it is done to retain the real chili powder  bite  that is so good.
4251	4	Previously the only oil I have used on my hair - by personal choice and the recommendation of my stylist - was Moroccan Oil. Though my hair is very fine, it is also a bit damaged from being colored and tends to be a bit dry. That said, if I do not wash it at least every couple of days it can get very greasy. It's a pain, to say the least :) If you are curious as to what it looks like, I suggest that you look at the pictures on my public blog - [...]. I color my hair platinum blonde but *I do not bleach it*. The roots are dyed every 4-6 weeks, though I do try to keep the dye off the ends as it helps them stay somewhat healthy. I would say that I straighten my hair about 2-3 times a week at once and almost never use a blow dryer.<br /><br />I feel that this is important information because of the other reviews that have been posted for this product. The type of hair one has is of utmost importance when considering this product. If your hair is not at all chemically treated or dry of its own accord, I'm not certain you would need to use an oil at all, but even if your hair tends toward greasiness - especially when not washed - this oil still may work for you.<br /><br />First, it does have *a* smell, and while different from that of Moroccan Oil I did not find it to be any stronger or less pleasant or to last any longer than that of Moroccan Oil. Also, the dispenser is *way* better! It's always bugged me that Moroccan Oil comes in a regular little pouring bottle, as one has to be very careful not to pour too much. The little nozzle-type dispenser on CLEAR is far superior when it comes to controlling the amount that you pour into your hand.<br /><br />I used this oil on damp hair and dry hair. I didn't see much of a difference in how it worked based on how wet or dry my hair was, but I will say this - be careful when using it with other products/using it with a straightener. I used it on my dry hair, not thinking I would be straightening my hair that day...well, I changed my mind and did straighten my hair a little while later. In doing so I used my usual thermal protection spray (CHI 44 Iron Guard) and after spraying that on and using my straightener even the driest (dry as in least healthy) parts of my hair started feeling greasy :-/<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that price-point wise you are truly getting a bargain with this product. 3 oz for $5.56 here on Amazon, vs. Moroccan Oil costing $12-13 for .85 oz or about $40 for 3.4 oz on this site. I would say that I still slightly prefer my Moroccan Oil but as I can't always afford to spend so much on a teeny tiny bottle of the stuff, CLEAR is a great secondary option for me.
4252	5	Simply excellent! Great tasting and works. I have been using this for months with success. I highly recommend this product.
4253	4	I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10.
4254	5	I got my hot sauce just in time for christmas and i got free samples along with it which is great for i am always interested in trying new things. the hot sauce itself is exactly as i remember it hot!!!!! i got it as a gag gift for my dad who is obsessed with hot stuff.
4255	1	If this is supposed to be a top notch dog food, my dogs sure don't think so. There is a very odd smell to this food, it almost smells as if it is bad. Same smell came from the Bison flavor as well.  My dogs won't eat it.  Obviously other dogs like it otherwise they'd be out of business. Sorry I wasted money on 2 cases of this stuff.
4256	2	I have been ordering the three pack of regular Breakfast Blend for some time now, but Amazon sent the MEDIUM Breakfast Blend on my last order.  I tried to make sure I ordered the right one, and did, but they sent the MEDIUM anyway.  Quick tip:  the MEDIUM blend is absolutely awful.  Don't waste your money on this one if you're a regular Breakfast Blend lover.  The real/original Breakfast Blend is smooth and mellow with no bitterness and great taste.  This MEDIUM takes more like the institutional Maxwell House.  I won't be ordering this again.
4257	4	Yes, these do contain an occasional stem or seed.  I just pull it off before eating and life goes on.  These are a great snack for weight watchers.
4258	2	The aroma and flavor seem fine but it's just too weak to be of any value. Used the entire bottle to flavor a quart of home made ice cream and people were guessing what it was. Not enough licorice flavor and I spent twice the price of the ice cream just for the flavor that was not really there. If it was concentrated enough to be of value that would be great but I would never waste money on this item again. Just not enough flavor for the money.
4259	5	I love the cinnamon mentos and they are hard to find in my area. I would probably not purchase them again unless the price goes down.
4260	5	We flavor our iced tea and coffee.  This brand is rich and true, only a little will do ya.  Amazon has the Vanilla at a good price, we get other flavors direct from DaVinci.
4261	5	These cookies are amazinggg. Theyre like 10 times tastier than the regular wheat animal crackers that come in the little boxes.<br />The animals they make are the elephant, the lion, the bear(my favorite), the zebra, a camel, a furry cat, a circus cart, something im pretty sure is a fox, a monkey and a hippo.<br />The cookies are a lovely snack and there is just the right amount in the bag. I will definitely buy these again.
4262	5	Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the  green pearl  of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself  home of silk and tea  for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name  gunpowder  derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.
4263	5	I found this at a Walmart supercenter and was sooooo suprised that they were carrying something organic!  It is delicious and very healthy for you---what's not to love?  It is overpriced on here, by a couple of dollars a bottle.  At least they are offering free shipping now : )
4264	3	They're okay, but not the most amazing thing ever.<br /><br />~ The Good ~<br />Good flavor, no too strong or weak.<br />Crunchy, but not too dry.<br />Plenty of chips in each bag. Not just filled with air.<br />Not greasy, so makes a good on-the-go snack.<br />All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.<br /><br />~ The Bad ~<br />Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so don't get them expecting them to be low fat.<br />Tastes like a low-fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.<br /><br />~ Conclusion ~<br />I'm 50/50 on if I'll order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not.
4265	5	We love this tea.  It is no longer available in our local grocery chain so we purchased from Amazon.  Glad it's available online and will continue to order from Amazon.
4266	5	These wafers are wonderfully light and taste just like Nutella. They're the perfect size for snacking, and incredibly addictive. :)
4267	5	A friend of mine who also happens to be a Sheriff told me that if you drink and drive, the first thing the officer pulling you over will check your breath; if he senses the odor of liquor, wine, or beer, he then will have due cause to order you to perform roadside sobriety tests, etc. Many people mistakenly use Binaca spritz or other miniature mouth wash products -- but they all contain ALCOHOL and can actually increase your meter reading.<br /><br />He recommended that I keep a tin of Altoids in the car to at least get through the initial inspection by the officer. But if you're really drunk, no mint on earth can hide that fact.<br /><br />Since I find Altoids to be generally strong, almost too strong, I ultimately chose the Spearment flavor, as it actually tasts okay and leaves the breath smelling fresh but not overpowering.
4268	5	These are the best things Werther's has ever done!  However, I should warn you that they are addictive.  If you like chewy candies and butterscotch - you will be pleased.
4269	5	This is very Bold and strong! Just the way I like it! No bitter after taste, just good coffee! It is good breakfast coffee for me. I like that Kick-start option.
4270	5	Tea has a very smooth and refreshing taste to it. One of the best teas I have had so far.
4271	5	After reading the book  Muscle foods  I set out to buy products listed in the book for a healthier life. Well, the problem here is that the foods listed are not easily found at the local stores. The item is exactly as described an provides the health value as mentioned in the book. Very happy.
4272	5	This soda has a distinct cola flavor but there is a great deal more going on. It is a spiced cola with wonderful notes of ginger. This lively drink is a pleasure :)<br />I got it on a whim at a local international supermarket to help cure some car sickness and it worked like very well and tasted excellent. I highly recommend this soda for any cola connoisseur.
4273	5	I bought the pit popper and the popcorn and it is absolutely delicious.  The popcorn tastes like theatre popcorn. Huge hit at the campground!!!  I would certainly recommend to everyone.  The pit popper is well worth the money too.
4274	1	So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.  There is something about this I just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl.  I even waited for it to cool down, but it got worse.  Very disapointed in this product and it was not what I was expecting at all.
4275	5	Product is superior in taste to most chai beverages.<br />Product comes in convenient packaging (bag or canister)for easy storage or take along.
4276	4	Good transaction with no problems involved. Product was delivered on time and the only draw-back was that the package was in German.
4277	5	These bars will save you in a pinch.  With a gluten allergy, I must always be prepared, and KIND bars are not only satisfying and delicious, but they fit the bill with REAL ingredients that you may pronounce without having to take on a new accent.  Thank you to AMAZON, too, for your excellent service and timely shipping!  GO GET 'EM!
4278	5	I'm not exactly young, and all I can say is this is the tastiest fruit spread I have ever tasted.
4279	5	Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their  licks  from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous  Four Paws Up  from my test panel!  Highly recommended!
4280	3	Did not like it. Taste was not smooth, will not order it again. Made it in a<br />french Press<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YVTF30 >Coffee Coarse Grind Bag</a> and my regular auto maker.
4281	1	Iams recalled its FP formula dry dog food on 7/30/10.  However, Amazon was still selling this product as late as 8/3/10.  But that's not even the worst part.  After the recall, Amazon's merchants were advertising this product as being on sale for 70% off. Unbelievable!
4282	4	These crackers are normally on the expensive side, but Amazon was having a sale that made them only about $2 per box -- so I thought they would be worth a try. One thing I like about them is that each box has two pouches inside; each pouch has two  servings  so you don't have to worry too much about them going stale once the box is opened!<br />These crackers have a nice texture. The most noticeable flavor is kind of an anise seed taste, which I found surprising at first but it grew on me after I ate a couple of crackers. My son and I polished off the first little pouch we opened in a matter of minutes; we've both been missing a good cracker!<br />I don't know that I would pay full price for a case of these crackers, but I am going to go order more while they're still on sale! I think they'll be good with tuna salad, slices of ham and cheese, or any number of things that go well with crackers!
4283	5	My dog has been on <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2JKGO >Canidae Dry Dog Food, Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Formula, 35-Pound Bag</a> for 8 years now. I recently added this to her diet. Stool is more firm. Seems like she's crazy about the taste too. Texture is a little thick even when mixed with water.
4284	1	it is really good or really bad<br />so overall lately we'd rate it 1 star but had been a 5 at one point...
4285	4	As far as coffee drinks go, this one does not taste better or worse than any of the others.  I drank it with ice and concentrated on what I was doing (tasting) to get the full experience, but the result was just  blah,  nothing to write home about.  It's expensive so I was ready to take in some fabulous coffee concoction.  I only drank half the can and later on, mixed the other half with a little coffee-flavored vodka, which made for a very nice, smooth drink.
4286	5	We are an always busy famiily of four, with two of them teenagers, and we eat a LOT of bars, with different people having different favorites. Our daughter does not have celiac disease, but has an easily upset stomach, and likes these Glutino Gluten Free breakfast bars best. I like all kinds of bars, but I've also noticed that Glutino bars (of whatever flavor) satisfy me whether for breakfast or a snack AND at the same time do not make my stomach feel like there's a lump of food in it. I think this is due to the lack of gluten, because I've also noticed that gluten-free muffins do not make my stomach feel full the way a regular muffin made with flour does.<br /><br />In addition, the Glutino bars have no cholesterol and very low sodium.<br /><br />Here's some basic nutritional information on the Glutino Apple bar. For comparison, I show the information for other bars currently in our stash. (Sorry, the review format doesn't allow nice spreadsheet columns.) All of these bars have 0 mg trans fat.<br /><br />Brand: Glutino Gluten Free<br />Name: Apple<br />Size: 40 gram<br />Calories: 150<br />Calories from Fat: 15<br />Sat Fat/Total Fat: 0g/1.5g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 50 mg<br /><br />Band: Balance...Name: Lemon Meringue Crunch...Size: 50 gram...Total Calories: 200...Calories from Fat: 60...Saturated Fat/Total Fat: 4 g/7 g...Cholesterol: 0 mg...Sodium: 210 mg<br /><br />Brand: Balance...Name: Chocolate Peanut Butter...Size: 50 gram...Calories: 200...Calories from Fat: 70...Sat Fat/Total Fat: 3.5g/7g...Cholesterol: 5mg...Sodium: 150 mg<br /><br />Brand: Zone Perfect Classic...Name: Chocolate Mint...Size: 50 gram...Calories: 210...Calories from Fat: 60...Sat Fat/Total Fat: 4.5g/7g...Cholesterol: &lt;5mg...Sodium: 220 mg<br /><br />Brand: Cliff Builder's...Name: Chocolate Mint...Size: 68 gram...Calories: 270...Calories from Fat: 70...Sat Fat/Total Fat: 5g/8g...Cholesterol: 0mg...Sodium: 230 mg<br /><br />Brand: Larabar...Name: Cherry Pie...Size: 48 gram...Calories: 190...Calories from Fat: 80...Sat Fat/Total Fat: 0.5g/8g...Cholesterol: 0mg...Sodium: 0 mg<br /><br />Brand: 18 Rabbits...Name: Funky Figs and Cherries...Size: 54 grams...Calories: 220...Calories from Fat: 70...

4287	5	I am a sucker for this cereal. The price here on Amazon far beats the local price that I pay for this item even when using a coupon.  Almost always the boxes are far dated so that I don't feel rushed to consume them quickly as well.
4288	5	After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad.
4289	5	My 10 month old German Shepherd was having problems digesting her old food, another one of those  all natural, no artificial ingredients, etc  types. She'd eat it, but her stools would be loose and she'd have occasional bouts of diarrhea. Finally, she stopped eating her food altogether. I was getting frustrated and worried that she had stopped eating.<br /><br />At the recommendation of a friend, I tried Royal Canin German Shepherd Puppy formula. I purchased the smaller bag just in case. Without even having to transition her to the new food, she immediately took a liking to this brand. She eats it excitedly, and her stools have become much more solid.
4290	5	I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to  double brew  your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.
4291	4	As others have said,  if you like your tea to taste like the smell of a campfire , then this would be the tea for you.  I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it  smokey tea  instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of  softens  the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!
4292	5	This is a healthy and good snack for my dog.  It is a great training produst too.  When you take into account that a couple are all she needs it is a good value.
4293	1	They are not kidding about a unique taste!  This stuff tastes like soapy mud!  I am a bit of a tea connoisseur, familiar with some of the different tastes, but this stuff falls into the category of dirty carpet cleaning water.  Don't waste your money--now what am I going to do with 49 K-cups?  No wonder they are lowering the price!  My husband actually gagged....
4294	5	For coffee lovers who enjoy a strong  cup of coffee in the morning then French Roast is the coffee for you. It has a rich bold flavor that will kick start your day.
4295	5	Our child loves these fruit snacks, my husband and I love them too. A delicious organic fruit snack that we all enjoy.
4296	5	Virginia Gentlemen BBQ sauce is good on its own (just a little bit of heat and not too sweet). It's also good as a starting point if you want to mix up your own hot sauce. Sometimes spicy sauces can be all heat and no depth, or the heat occludes the sauce's personality. Mix it with some VG and you'll get a kicking sauce with lots of depth. We smoke briskets a lot during the summer and VG is a must have for those dinners. Slather some on white bread with thin sliced onions and sliced Claussen pickles, top with tender brisket and you've got a little heaven on earth. Divine!
4297	5	I've been getting these treats for the last year for my two senior dogs.  Both have had various hip and joint problems in the past, but have not had any problems since they've been taking these.  And they love them!  I've tried all the flavors, and have not had a problem with them eating it.  They think it's a yummy treat, and get excited when I pull them out.  I would definitely recommend for anyone with older dogs.
4298	5	As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
4299	1	Previously bought another brand and loved the bright flavor and somewhat firm texture.  Really added a lot to my dish.  I bought this brand as the other was unavailable, and will never do so again.  Better to do without.  It was bitter, extremely salty, and had the texture of soggy bread.  Ruined my dinner.  Seemed decomposed.  Opened the second jar I bought and it was the same. Threw them both in the garbage. Never again.
4300	5	I recently bought 4 different boxes of the K-Cups and I ALWAYS find myself popping this one in. The flavor is crazy good and I was completely surprised when I tasted the creamer that was thrown in. I love it. I love it a lot.
4301	5	I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.
4302	5	I use ghee a lot for cooking (couscous, frying fish, etc.) instead of butter.  This is a great size if you use ghee in the regular basis and the price is fantastic and unbeatable.  You don't have to refrigerate ghee so it does not take space in your fridge.
4303	5	I feel good about giving my baby organic formula (since nursing didn't work out).  I don't want her to have anything with antibiotics and hormones at such a young age.  She likes this formula.  It never irritated her stomach, it's just as easy to make as any other powdered formula, and the price is reasonable for a high-quality product.
4304	5	Weruva - Love Me Tender - is the only flavor they love.  It's a shame that it does contain Tuna.  The main meat ingredients are Chicken and Duck.<br />This seller does not list the ingredients.  I have found it cheaper at PetFlow.com and GoPetFood.com.
4305	5	I've researched the ingredients and I think this is a high quality, clean product. But it's better for the cats if you add water to it, as even a vet on their website mentions. High-protein dry food is too dehydrating otherwise (all dry food wears on kidneys and urinary system).
4306	4	This coffee has made me forget Starbucks. It tastes a lot like the grande lattes I had been drinking. I'm using it in the Platinum Keurig and making the largest cup size (travel mug size.) Wonderful.
4307	5	I was looking for a different type of taste from a coffee, something a little stronger, but it had to go down smooth. This coffee surely filled the bill. I was drinking another brand and it was leaving a nasty taste in my mouth and just didn't seem to go down as smoothly as Tully's. I really recommend you try it if you are looking for a strong but smooth coffee!
4308	5	Store mixes are just OK. My mother always made cakes from scratch and frosting. This cake mix tastes like homemade and we love them ...all of them. I am so excited to try the new ones coming out.<br /><br />Since I discovered these we have cupcakes in our house all the time. (No we are not fat)  One cupcake is equivalent to 1/2 piece cake.  I deplore store bought frosting in the can, always have.  This frosting takes homemade. Do yourself a big favor and use REAL butter in the frosting instead of the artificial stuff.  Makes all the difference in the world. Tastes just like Mom's.<br /><br />Kids will love the dots inside the cake. They show up well s long as you do not over beat the batter. The sprinkles for the frosting being all natural, are a real plus. You don't have to buy your own to add. It is just a thing with me, I have to have sprinkles on my cupcakes!<br /><br /> Side note, my Mom's dad was a farmer and they always ate lots of  butter and whole milk. My dad's dad was  farmer and ditto.  9 kids in mom's family and 4 in dad's. Of the total 13 kids, 3 have died and all were over 80. The remaining children are still alive are in  their late 80's and  90's. It appears Butter and  whole milk have not had a negative affect on them.<br /><br />Great cake mix and frosting mix. All natural and that is a wonderful thing.<br /><br />For those of you who have said the mix is not sweet enough, you can always add a little sugar! I think it is fine but have added extra sugar at times.
4309	5	This was received with some damage but the company replaced the problem bags immediatley. Good baking flour too. all natural and organic.
4310	5	This is the best dark Chocolate you will ever eat! Too bad it is so expensive to ship! It is worth the treat
4311	3	I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account.
4312	2	I saw the name  Chips Ahoy!  and thought of delicious, crispy chocolate chippy goodness. Alas, these don't live up to the brand name.<br /><br />I rarely buy storebought cookies, honestly, so I really looked forward to trying these as a treat. Here's my two cents:<br /><br />1. The allegedly mega fudge filling is not very noticeable except as a faintly chemical, chocolate-like slime. Minifudge filling would have been more accurate. The last two days were quite warm and the cookies became almost liquid on contact with warm fingers. Quite a mess, especially with kids. In short, the gooey filling seems to me a gimmick.<br /><br />2. The cookie part tasted like fake chocolate, which was a turnoff for me. I love chocolate like nobody's business, but it has to be GOOD chocolate (which this was definitely NOT.) A chocolate candy bar of almost any kind would have been more satisfying.<br /><br />If I want a tender cookie, I can make better ones myself from scratch. If I'm going to buy a chocolate chip cookie, I'll stick with the original crispy Chips Ahoy.
4313	5	My dog absolutely loves these. My only complaint is that they're a little pricey, but it's worth it for an occasional big  treat .
4314	5	Great product especially for small dogs.  They are, however, somewhat fragile but as they are shipped in the plastic container, they arrive in great shape.  This was my second order.
4315	5	My cat could not wait to eat some of this food.  She really seemed to enjoy the food.  She ate it up very quickly.  In my opinion any cat would love to get some of this food.
4316	5	John McCann's steel cut Irish oatmeal does not have an equal in the oatmeal market. Even the  fancy  tin it comes in with all of the gold trimmings shouts  I'm the BEST . One taste of the rich nuttiness & chewiness of this porridge will convince you to ban rolled oats, especially the instant varieties, from your household. There is nothing instant about this product; it does take time to boil water, add the oats & cook for 30 minutes. The flip side is you can make a batch once a week & eat from it for several days by reheating a portion in the microwave...it truly is worth the effort.
4317	5	Started using lard again, and I love this product.  For the poster that said that this product has partially hydrogenated fat, this is a quote from the ConAgra Foods (Armour) company, emailed to a customer who posts on proteinpower.com who inquired about their lard:<br /><br /> Thank you for your email dated 5/1/2008. Armour Lard has .02% fully hydrogenated (zero % moisture) lard flakes added in the lard to make the end product more stable. I hope this answers your question. If you need more information please feel free to call me at (800) 456 1330.<br />David Short<br />Director of Sales<br />Armour Specialty Marketing <br /><br />Personally, in lieu of fresh rendered pork fat, which I do make and LOVE, using this product is a nice substitute when I don't have the fresh rendered stuff on hand.
4318	5	Tastes amazing, and surprisingly fills you up. Great to have on the go especially in the morning and I'll feel full until lunch time. Also Amazon's offer is an amazing deal. At my local Whole Foods, each go for $3.50
4319	5	i was able to try this from my friend... i tasted youndoo before i cook and it was lil salty and sweet. i recenlty gave birth to baby and i asked my mom to add youndoo on soup and it tasted really good! i made steamed egg with youndoo,i loved it! we also used on many side dishes. we dont even have to add salt on sided ish because youndoo has right amount saltiness. also this is good for dipping sauce, my family ate grandma's mandoo and it was better than just dipping on soy sauce. resturant should use this instead of msg!!! this is really a true flavor enhancer!<br /><br />im so happy that they are selling online!!
4320	5	I was not really sure these pretzles would be as good as claimed.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong, as good as  regular  pretzles if not better and healther!<br /><br />DO NOT HESITATE to try these, you will not be sorry.
4321	4	I was looking for something healthy to snack on at night.  A lot of the mixed nut/fruit products out there are full of sugar, fat and other things that are not good for you.  This product is all natural and quite tasty.  To compare, the equivalent Kirkland brand all natural mix is 150 calories for 3 tablespoons.  The Terrafina product is 140 calories for a 1/4 cup.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is sometimes their fruit is a little sweet because they do add a bit of sugar for their fruit.  That's probably more of a personal taste than anything.  Otherwise great product.
4322	4	Picked these up at the same time we ordered some of the freeze-dried liver cubes.<br />These are a less expensive option.<br />Arrived quickly, like everything we get through Amazon.<br />There are 6 boxes in the order, and each box has the treats arrive in a plastic bag to keep the treats soft and fresh.<br />When you open the bag, they smell like peanut butter cookies, and my dog liked them immediately.<br />They're about the size of fig newtons, so might be larger than some folks are looking for.<br />The bag doesn't reseal well, so we transferred them to an airtight container, and they've kept better there.<br />They do tend to stick together, and can get kinda crumbly, and if left in the original packaging, will go stale.<br />Overall, still well worth the money.
4323	5	These are my favorite ginger snaps & I was so pleased to be able to order these in bulk from Amazon.  I even got my first order from Amazon Warehouse so they were deeply discounted.  These are great with peanut butter.  Yum.  I also like to crush them up a little in my mortar & pestle & mix them into my granola.  They also make good cookie crumb pie crusts.  There are so many great uses for these including of course just eating them out of the bag.
4324	5	This is the best cat food- I introduced it to my 16yr old cat slowly and she is much healthier, has a shiner coat and sheds less. Each time I purchase, I switch up the flavors, cats love variety.<br />Great product!
4325	5	I am so happy I purchased this item.  It was better than I expected and I will definitely order again.  The consistency was perfect and the taste heavenly.  I can cook with it and use it as a facial spa treatment.  What more could a girl want?
4326	5	I like my coffee strong and rich, and can't stand the typical watery cup of coffee served in cheap restaurants, and I can never get consistent brews when I make it myself. Most instant coffees are disgusting. The Italian Roast is a great alternative. It really caters for people like me, who like it stronger than average. I wish the cost would go down a little so I could make it a daily beverage.<br /><br />I also drink the decaf version, which is just as good.
4327	5	I enjoyed all the different flavors of the salt water taffy and not expense at all. Just order this item in the cold months.
4328	4	I am happy with the taste of this product-takes a little longer to dissolve than my raspberry lemonade, but worth the few extra stirs  :)
4329	5	This has a nice full flavor. i thought that since this isn't made in Vermont it wouldn't be very good but it's just fine.
4330	5	This is a delicious cocoa powder for baking or mixing into hot milk. It is unsweetened but has a slight natural sweetness. I have learned to enjoy it with any added sweetener, thus avoiding the calories of sugar and any possible side-effects of chemical sweeteners.<br /><br />I tend to get heartburn easily and this is one of only two cocoa products I've found that don't give me heartburn. The other is from a store that does not have a web presence and is not local to me, so for me it is worth paying extra to get this cocoa.
4331	4	This is pretty strong stuff - if you are not nuts about garlic I would stay away...far away. My entire desk smells like garlic now, ha. The flavor reminds me of garlic bread at an Italian restaurant. There is a little salt on them too, which is great. The pistachios themselves are super fresh and crunchy. If you like garlic AND pistachios this is for you. The onion is very subtle, more of an after taste.<br /><br />One recommendation for Fiddyment Farms would be to dial back the garlic a bit...just a bit, to attract non-garlic fiends. Otherwise, this is a supreme product.
4332	5	This is my kids favorite jarred baby food. I make most of the food at home and in a pinch I revert to Butternut Squash bisque, most other jarred baby food are unpalatable. This is creamy and has chicken and veggies. So it's a win<br />I usually used to buy this from Babies r us, but with subscribe and save plus the shipping home factor has made amazon.com a fav shopping site.<br />Tip to make this more calorific: once my baby got to 11 mos and wanted more chunkier food, I used to mash up an egg yolk ( boiled) with a splash of whole milk and make it into a paste, pour in warm Bisque and thicken with oatmeal or brown rice cereal . (disclaimer: my kids have never been allergic to milk or eggs and I started them on it pretty early, you might wanna add formula)
4333	5	Sent this to a friend as a thank you. Ordered it yesterday, she got it TODAY! I actually ordered the wrong thing & had to call Leonidas (in New York) the lady spoke broken English, but I explained, she changed the order & everything was wonderful!  Susan shared a chocolate with me & I'm tellin ya, all the people that have said that Godiva doesn't even come close...are RIGHT!!! Excellente!!!!!!!
4334	5	I just love Spectrum products.  So glad they have the sprays.  Very pleased with my package.  Thank you fast service.
4335	1	I tried this pickling spice in a batch of pickles. I love all kinds of pickled veggies with salt and vinegar (no sweet or bread/butter) but hate the way this made my batch taste. I would NOT use this again...ever. Nasty!
4336	1	Unfortunately, this item does not hold up well in the microwave.  I purchased the pack of six and have tried three.  After following directions, each have bubbled up in the microwave, causing the liquid to spill everywhere.  I will not buy again.
4337	1	I just bought this at the store trying to get my cheesy snack and both my wife and I thought it had a taste of a greasy strawberry with a hint of butter.  HORRIBLE.  I cannot believe this product is even sold???  Who in their right mind thinks this even tastes anything like cheddar?
4338	3	This water is good, it is possibly the best tasting of the water we had in our taste test which included several well knows brands, grocery store distilled and filtered, as well as in home reverse osmosis. But this was a side by side comparison. All the water we tasted is exceptional on its own.<br /><br />I don't personally believe any health benefits, the small difference in pH from other water seems it would quickly be equalized in the acid digestive environment.<br /><br />I did find some change in baking but it was not a improvement, the high ph seemed to interfere with yeast and pizza dough did not form a quality skin as if the gluten formation was negatively impacted.<br /><br />Conclusion, the water is good, but seems expensive without any appreciable advantage.
4339	5	I absolutely love this product.  The cats enjoy them and they keep hairballs away.  I have signed up for auto-ship because I couldn't live without them.
4340	5	The cats love this food and their coats have never looked better. We have two older and two younger cats.
4341	5	I as well as most people on these reviews ate the cereal all the time as a child, and purchase it because of the memories and great taste it has.My Family and I now purchase this 4 pack once a week from this seller and it's excellent. I've never had a problem with a package being damaged,the shipping's fast, and the product tastes like it always has!! thank you!!
4342	5	These chips are a regular in my house now.  In fact they are the only chips I buy.  The BBQ flavor is my favorite.  I buy these in single serving packs because if I buy a bigger bag, it is too hard to stop eating them.
4343	3	Intended to make baby's food, thought I would just use my steamer basket and food processor but got this for Xmas and use it daily. I've steamed and pureed fruit, veg, meat, fish, grain and used it to reheat. I like that you just set it to steam and walk away (you have a baby after all). It's generally easy to use and clean. Complaints about big batches are funny because I can't do SMALL enough batches! I like to make just one or two servings to eat that day. I don't want to serve frozen food all the time or the same food day after day. Babycook does not blend small batches, I have to mash by hand! This is exactly what such a tiny appliance should do!<br /><br />There are also design issues, not how it looks (it is cute) but how it works (it is finicky). The spatula and mixing lid are awkward extra pieces to keep track of and clean. The mixing lid is useless. When removing the lid to stir there are two messy lids to remove, set down on the counter and clean, etc. It works just fine without it. The spatula is not great at scraping the bowl and if it is only intended to lift a hot basket, this could be solved more intelligently. Teardrop lid handles are slippery and difficult to grasp. Blades are not easily removable.
4344	5	If those dense, heavy nutrition bars are too rich for you to tolerate or if you can't handle them after a hard workout, this one is worth trying.  It's very tasty and light.  The wafers give it a nice texture and crunch and it will remind you of those creme wafer cookies from childhood but much tastier and with better nutrition.  I will say that if you're looking for a  super bar  this may not be ideal because it does have a little more fat in it than other bars I like and a bit less protein and carbs, but it's worth buying because it tastes really good, it's light and easy to digest.  For me, this is a great meal replacement bar/snack or great after a light to moderate workout.
4345	5	The coffee was the same coffee bought at a more expensive price at the local market.  Thank you for providing this product.
4346	3	Certainly not the most appetizing snack on the planet. But a lot of that is just how dry it is; make sure you have a beverage handy with this! I recommend hot tea of one kind or another. That might not be super convenient if you just want to carry these to school or on a hike in your backpack for when you need a quick, healthy boost. But it definitely makes them more palatable--trust me! In fact a nice hot tea makes them downright tasty if you're in the mood for such a thing; one of my favorite aspects is that they aren't too sweet.
4347	1	I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said,  oooh I have to try .  I was sorely disappointed.  I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.  I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.  So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.  So I went ahead and ate it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It was like torture eating this.  It tasted awful.  I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.  He tried it and he felt the same way.  It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.<br /><br />Who I'd recommend it to:  1.) People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat. 2.) My enemies.
4348	4	I bought this at my local high end pet food shop for $9.  I brought it home, and gave it to the pup on the patio.  My dog is a 70 lbs lab/pit mix around 1 year old.  The good: he loved it and didn't upset his stomach at all.  The not so great: lasted about 90 minutes, in two sessions.  I gave it to him on day one for an hour, and he finished about 30% of it, then I took it away and saved the rest for the next day, which only took him like half an hour to seal the deal (nothing left whatsoever).  It's fun for a try, but at $9, I think I won't buy too many more.
4349	5	Pumpkin Powder is amazing!! I made Pumpkin Spice Creamer with the powder (rather than pumpkin puree) to minimize sifting complications. It worked beautifully.Thanks Barry Farm Foods.
4350	5	This coffee is rich with a slight hit of mocha and full bodied.  I am very picky about coffee and this is my all time favorite.
4351	3	I just wanted a little extra gift to hand dad for Father's Day and this fit the bill. The logs are a little smaller than I would have liked but it was good sausage and cheese, overall I'd say it was worth the price paid.
4352	5	I never liked plain  green tea.  I thought I  would try  this white/ green tea combo. I love it ! and the health benefits are great also. The more you drink of it the better  (also weight loss)
4353	5	My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't  kick in  for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.
4354	1	The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care.
4355	1	Too bad this arrived in a ripped bag. I ordered everything I needed to make several recipes I wanted to try, and now I have to order it again or buy it somewhere else. Amazon says they can't just replace it because the inventory comes from someone else, and the refund could take up to 4 weeks after they receive the return. Just crappy service all around.
4356	5	delicious -- i eat this stuff by the spoonful. goes great on ANYTHING. gonna makes some eggs right now and pour it on thick. oh yeah.
4357	5	I served this coffee to guests after dinner and the response was  I believe this is the best coffee I have ever had .  I agree, it is the best!
4358	3	The Fettuccine noodles are a bit weird tasting and the texture is weird too. I prefer the angel hair with a tomato marinara sauce. But as a diabetic I am glad to have these as an option. I will keep experimenting until I find something that works better than the Alfredo sauce.<br /><br /> they are very quick to make but do smell  I hate to use the same adjective , but it is the best) Weird.
4359	5	Love this product because I have rosecea on one side of my face and it is gentle enough for that buut strong enough to get rid of any remaining traces of makeup or oil, leaving a nice fresh feeling on the skin. Along with the price being very reasonable, you only use a little on a pad so the product goes a long way.
4360	5	My terrier chases it all around the house. He finally gets tired - a good thing! The cap can be adjusted for the size of the treats, and how fast you want your dog to get the treats. If at the  easiest  setting, my terrier finds a way to remove the cap. For aggressive hunters I suggest keeping the cap at the tightest setting.
4361	5	My toddler loves these little things, has since he was 10 months old. Although he can eat an entire can in one day now that he's 3...doctor told me that as a snack/filler this is not a bad thing to feed kids at young ages, has some good ingredients and isn't fried or full of fat.  Do try to eat the contents within a week, so they stay fresh and crisp.
4362	5	I agree with Lizzie.  :)<br /><br />I purchase cases of the 12.5 ounce cans for my cats at the local mom and pop pet supply store.  It is the only brand that they consistently will eat that is grain free.  I have two cats that only eat wet food and use one 12.5 ounce can per day.  It's a great bargain compared to the smaller cans.  I would purchase it online if the cost with shipping was closer to what I pay at the local store.<br /><br />If you're trying to go GRAIN FREE or at least ALL WET FOOD for your kitties, do try Wellness.  I have tried nearly every type of grain free or lower grain or organic/natural canned cat food there is available; while my cats will eat some of the other stuff sometimes, they like Wellness the best.  I only feed them the plain Turkey and Chicken flavors, since they usually don't do too well with beef or seafood.<br /><br />(Note:  by grain free I mean no corn, wheat, or soy.  If you look at the ingredient list, there are sweet potatoes and other vegetables/fruits, so it is not just protein.)<br /><br />GO GRAIN FREE!  It's better for the kitties.<br />My 12 and 13 year old cats are shinier, healthier, and more active now that they've changed to this diet over the last year.  My fat cat lost weight and no longer has flaky skin.  They only throw up hairballs now instead of the frequent  other  vomits before.  And the diarrhea that was plaguing one cat for the previous two years has completely ended.  Solid, regular poops - believe me, it's a relief (yes, I know it's gross to talk about, but it's true!).<br /><br />I may take the final step to RAW DIET for them... haven't decided yet.  But at least I know on this food they are thriving.
4363	3	I haven't had any American junk food in so long, so I found this snack a bit too salty for my taste, and oily as well.
4364	2	We bought this from a candy shop a couple of years ago. Make no mistake - this is not chocolate and it has no chocolate flavor. The orange in its name refers to the color it changes - not to its flavor.<br /><br />The directions call for you to mix the powder with hot water. If you do this it will taste terrible. It becomes only mildly acceptable (to some) when mixed with hot milk rather than water.<br /><br />Its only real use is that the empty cauldron can be used for a decoration around Halloween.
4365	5	I was afraid to try them after reading one review on how they stink.  I briefly smelled them and they were maybe a little like amonia or mushrooms when they start to get mushy.  I rinsed them off and tasted one...not much flavor which is par for the course with pasta anyway.  These are much healthier and lighter.  I put the noodles in a pot of  No-Chicken broth (veggie but chix flavored), a bag of veggies (fiesta blend), onion, and chix strips. Made a great low cal lunch soup.  Yay!
4366	5	These are tasty.  Great Strawberry flavor.  Nice and crisp and only 100 calories.  I buy these on the subscription plan to save even more money.  I even ship these to my daughters!
4367	5	You would never know this was a decaffeinated coffee unless you read the label.<br />This is a full bodied coffee without a trace of bitterness.  The only satisfying decaf I've found.
4368	5	I have a Chinese Shar-Pei and he loves this! He's highly allergic to corn, wheat, and soy it doesn't have any of that.  What's also great is unlike petfood stores that charge an arm and a leg to ship dog food Amazon doesn't.  I hope they keep carrying this!
4369	1	I buy this soup in grocery stores for $2.99 per package. Here the cost is $4.24 per package.
4370	5	I wont even buy coffee at starbucks because seriously this is better. I have had my senseo for years and have no desire to have any thing other than this one. I love it so much that I have a new back up machine in a box just in case this one ever goes out. I know that sounds weird but seriously I love this coffee!
4371	5	I prefer Luvs over any other brand! They have a powder scent and are the only diapers my petite daughter doesn't blow out of!
4372	5	These are the best tasting cookies ever! When I found out I couldn't have anything with gluten, dairy or refined sugars, a friend told me about these cookies. She even gave me some for Christmas because she knew I couldn't have any of the other goodies people were bringing by. Buying them on Amazon saved me a considerable amount of money as well!
4373	3	The spiced apple cider isn't bad. It isn't as natural as Keurig cider but it is also 1/3 the price. It has aspertame which I use so I am used to it. Good flavor and a nice break from coffee. Also since I am on a diet, it only has 10 calories compared to 80 for the Keurig cider. For the price it is worth it.<br /><br />Update: after trying these for a box and the Keurig apple cider k kups, I have decided I like these better. I think they have more flavor and are sweeter. I would buy these again before I would buy the keurig ones.<br /><br />another update: I had these sitting in my closet for the summer. Went to make a cup and found that most of the cups had the powder harden(took one apart and it wasn't appealing) and a couple puffed up and broke away from the plastic. I emailed the company and they called back. Gave me SOME of my money back and requested I send a couple of the bad ones to them and they sent the necessary items for me to do that. They said as far as they knew there would not be a problem drinking them but I threw them away out of caution. Seems they are aware of the humidity problem. Wound up testing the powder cider drink you can get at Walmart and put it into my Ekobrew and it tasted fine.  Think I will be doing that from now on.
4374	1	This is not a sausage, this is paste in a plastic tube which is shaped like a sausage. Then you cut the tube off and you're left with a log of mash. As one other reviewer mentioned, it'd be better (and more honest) if this came in a tub.<br /><br />The taste is fine, but not remarkable in any way. I'm not sure how this product is better than you putting tofu, TSP and spices in a blender and then shaping it like poop.<br /><br />Usually vegan fake meats are at least texturally close, and while they can't approximate meat exactly they are at least trying. Soyrizo makes no attempt (other than the plastic packaging) at being what it claims to replace.<br /><br />It is a pain in the butt to cook as it has no structure at all, and it burns readily. I cooked half at a high temperature like the packaging suggested - it burned quickly! Then I cooked the other half at a low temperature, cut up into smaller poops so I could roll them over. Regardless of how long it was cooked, it did not dry out or become more solid.<br /><br />I was very very disappointed by this Soyrizo and will not buy it again.
4375	5	These bars have a good combination of nuts, are low glycemic and a satisfying snack for in-between meals or when meals are delayed. Wonderful for gluten/dairy intolerance. They travel well too.
4376	5	An old favorite of mine that still tastes just like it did 35+ years ago!!!!! And this place that I ordered from shipped them faster than fast!!! Five stars all the way!!!
4377	4	I purchased my first Rooibos tea from Teavana. I didn't want to pay the high price again, so started searching Amazon for something comparable.<br /><br />Although it's not the exact same flavor, it still taste nice, and you can't beat the price. It's about a third of what I'd pay at Teavana.<br /><br />I'll be purchasing this tea for now. :)
4378	5	Not much to say about the gum. It came in fast and fresh (over a year left before expiry). I happen to be a Chiclets fanatic so there is no way it is going to last that long though. I did however want to clarify the amount since I was a little confused by the description. These come as a package with two cases of hang bags. Each case has 7 bags, and each bag has 6 boxes of Chiclets. Obviously there are the standard 10 pieces per box. So this order comes with a total of 84 boxes of Chiclets. In other words, this is a good amount of gum for the price.
4379	5	My little one loves this combo!  Fair warning though, it seems to be a bit of a laxative!  :)
4380	3	I should have known when I saw corn syrup as the first ingredient.  This is glorified jelly.  I hoped there would be more whole raspberries or at least pieces in the filling but could not find many (if any) in two cans.  Admittedly, I purchased this to use as a topping for cottage cheese instead of baked goods.  It is terrible in that capacity.  I prefer Comstock pie fillings, which have actual fruit instead of a bunch of congealed syrup.<br /><br />UPDATE: I found I enjoyed this very much as a topping for greek yogurt.  It is still too high in sugar to enjoy regularly though.
4381	2	The mix itself is absolutely delicious, one of my favorites by far. But the value is terrible. It is a much better deal to buy the 1.5 ounce bags that Amazon offers in bulk, as opposed to these 2.75 ounce bags.
4382	5	My husband had tried these onions in a cocktail at a restaurant. He thought they were great. He ask the waitress for the brand and then I found them at Amazon.com and ordered them. He was delighted.
4383	5	This is a great salt; it has a wholesome flavor and, I noticed it doesn't make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does. That's the benefit of the natural balance of minerals in it. I would recommend this to friends and health conscious people.
4384	5	I didn't like tea very much until recently, and to me sugar and milk make tea taste disgusting. I've enjoyed a few flavors but when I got my hands on this, I knew it was meant to be. You take the teabag out of its pouch and it smells delicious, better than any tea I've ever smelled. Seriously, they could make potpourri out of this stuff! Compared to other chai's that I've tasted, this is my favorite. It comes in both decaf and caffeinated, so you can have it anytime... and just, yum. I highly recommend this tea!
4385	5	I love this tea!  If you like peach flavored teas, you'll probably like it.  Good amount of peach flavor.  Mild overall - not strong like black and not grassy like green.  Now and then I try other brands but end up always coming back to Stash.  Their blends/flavors are always my favorites - especially their Earl Grey.
4386	5	I have been eating the marshmallows out of cereal like crazy since I've been pregnant. My sister just sent me an order of these and I'm in love!! They are JUST LIKE the ones that come in cereal.
4387	4	Most of the Gloria Jean's flavors I am not a big fan of, but this one would be the exception. I really enjoyed the flavor and it was a nice change from my normal routine. Plus the price is very nice.
4388	5	I've purchased La Tourangelle Toasted Sesame Oil (3 pack) twice, and have been very happy with it both times.  The flavor of the oil is wonderful - it has a delicate sesame flavor that compliments Asian food.  Some sesame oils have an overly-toasted flavor that can overpower the food, but this one is just right.  What I like best about this product is the metal container it comes in.  Each 16.9 ounce container is sealed for freshness, and will stay fresh for several years in the pantry.  The lid is designed so it doesn't dribble when pouring the oil, and the screw-on lid keeps the contents of an opened bottle safe from air which can cause it to go rancid.<br /><br />This oil is expensive at over $8 per bottle, but when a recipe only calls for a few tablespoons it lasts a long time.  With free Amazon Super Saver Shipping, this is a good deal.
4389	5	I am a subscriber to these bars because they are so delicious and healthy! I love them for snacks when I need a quick pick me up!
4390	5	These are one of my dogs favorite treats. When they see the package come through the mail, they run around in circles and sit and wait for me to open the package so impatiently while wagging their tails like crazy. It's funny how they know it's for them. They must smell it. I love these. They are just the right size for training and for everyday use!!!!
4391	5	Thank you Amazon.  When my local Natual Foods COOP failed financially last year I was lost in this rural community without many of the foods that had become a part of our daily life.  Twisted fruit is family favorite and Amazon is my favorite suppler.  This is a healthy pocket food for my teenager and a stuffer for my elementry son's lunches.
4392	4	My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and in our experience, lunch is the hardest meal of the day. When we are at home we are fine, but when we are at work or school, it is either difficult to find safe Gluten Free food or a clean enough location in which to eat that food without contaminating it by all the meals previously eaten there. We try to carry our lunch when possible, but we rely on safety net foods such as the Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate and Protein Bars to save us in a pinch or help us have energy to get home.
4393	1	I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.<br />I think these popchips must be for  heath  type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.<br />We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.<br />After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.<br />They taste  hallow ,  empty , too artificial chemical taste.<br />With a regular potato chip I get the  that's it  sensation, satisfying, full flavor.
4394	1	Not good at all. Didnt like the candies. And you cant even return them. Total waste of money. Candies are so hard that you cant even get the taste of liquor. The liquor filled chocolates from Anthony Berg is way much better.
4395	3	I was primarily interested in just safron(yellow) rice rather than seasoned rice however this is the closest I could come to the real thing.
4396	5	My infant son loves most of this food.  It is easy to get cases shipped and not fumble with individual jars in the store.  Quick shipping, good packaging.  I've had no issues.
4397	5	I really enjoyed these bars.  They are one of the few bars claiming to be  natural  that actually aren't filled with unpronounceable ingredients.  There are very few, simple ingredients, which are all non-GMO.  A gluten free product.<br /><br />Very lightly sweetened.  Calories a little on the high side for a snack at 200 calories, but high in protein.<br /><br />I was mildly amused that the packaging is labeled as  may contain nuts  when it is a nutty granola bar that has visible nuts in it. :)  What can I say?  I'm easily amused.  I will certainly by these again and will be looking into their other flavors.
4398	4	in an effort to shed a few pounds, i decided to restrict my diet to high protein foods, vegetables, and nuts. When I learned that jerky was a great snack for dieters who wanted protein on-the-go, while avoiding the added carbs in meal replacement bars, I searched for a brand of jerky that was right for me.<br /><br />Knowing very little about jerky (save for the junk in convenience stores), I learned that most brands are full of hormones, nitrites, antibiotics, MSG, and erythorbate. Supposedly, none of these ingredients are harmful in moderation, but I was looking for a snack that I could rely on whenever I had food cravings, and I couldn't afford to compromise my health in the long run by regularly consuming any of these items. So, I was pleased to find out about Golden Valley's line of all natural jerky.<br /><br />Aside from the benefit of finding a vendor that produced a jerky free of preservatives and added MSG, there was the added bonus of learning that federal law actually prohibits the use of growth hormone in buffalo. My mind at ease, I ordered the peppered buffalo jerky and received it in record time using the super saver shipping option.<br /><br />As a meat snack, I found the product to be too sweet for my liking, but nevertheless adequate for my purposes. The texture is milder than the low quality jerky that I'm familiar with, but the pepper flavor could easily go unnoticed as it's way too understated. Every bag that I received was moist and easy to chew and the product was free of flaw or defect.<br /><br />At $1.49/oz., I get 11 grams of protein for the cost of 90 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 7 grams of sugar. Compare this to the leading meal replacement bar on Amazon that costs $2.07/bar for 27 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of fat, 26 grams of sugar (51 grams of total carbs), and a litany of unwanted ingredients in each 3.5-oz. bar. Ounce-for-ounce, we're looking at 11 grams of protein in the jerky versus roughly 8 grams of protein in the bar. Even considering the disappointing sweetness of the jerky, I still manage to avoid all the unwanted carbs and confections of replacement bars. Of course, jerky loses out in terms of cholesterol content.<br /><br />Jerky connoisseurs will likely find the sweetness of this product to be unappealing and off-putting. On the other hand, it's been a great diet aid and a reliable, additive-free defense against mid-meal cravings, and that's really all I wanted out of Golden Valley's Buffalo Jerky.
4399	5	I have four cats.  One cat is totally addicted to this treats - she is ridiculous about it.  Two cats could care less; and the fourth cat likes them but doesn't get crazy about getting them like the addicted cat.  Love the subscribe & save for all my cat treats and foods - makes my life easier.
4400	4	Jack Link's beef jerky is a quick and great tasting way to get extra protein into your diet.  A great snack.  I really like the teriyaki flavor.
4401	4	Even I think that this baby food tastes good.  My 9 month old agrees.  I love that the ingredients are literally sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apples, and blueberries.  The only ingredient not in the title is lemon juice.  No crazy preservatives or other ingredients.  The problem is the company that is selling them on Amazon.  Don't take it out on Ella's.  You can find it MUCH more reasonably priced on diapers.com, or at Target.  I agree w/ another reviewer that the Plum organics baby food is also good, and a little cheaper, but this is still a staple in our son's diet.
4402	4	I like the taste and the satiation factor of the product.  The protein, calorie and fat ratios are near ideal.  And, did I mention convenience; convenient?  I've ordered these on the timely delivery program.  Also, I like the lack of greasiness feel to them.  I keep them stored in my freezer to ward off any mold problem that I've seen claimed (I do appreciate those comments for giving me a  heads up ).  These are a great product that I recommend.
4403	5	We have a professional espresso machine and would never use another type of coffee. Try this and you will not be sorry.
4404	5	My family found the Planters Big Nut Bars to be just as advertised - a big nut bar.  Peanuts are a healthy fat and the bars contained other nutritious ingredients like oatmeal, honey, almonds...  The bar is full of protein and carbs and would make a great snack to take on the trail if you're into hiking and camping.  If you have to watch your sugar intake or have to count calories, you need to be aware that this bar can replace a small meal.  Otherwise, it tastes delicious and is quite filling.
4405	4	I was shopping around for nutritional yeast, and based on the price and the reviews I found online, I decided to go with this brand.  It is definitely packed with nutrients and is a great source of many vitamins and minerals.  It's flavor is good, although this is the first nutritional yeast I've bought, so I can't compare it to other brands.  The smell upon first opening the jar seemed a bit strong, but it wasn't as bad after using it and opening/closing the jar a few times.<br /><br />I am mostly writing this review to let other potential customers know that this product is NOT VEGAN.  I guess everyone defines veganism a little differently, but this nutritional yeast contains whey from milk, so if you don't want to eat dairy, or can't for some health reason, you should be aware of that before you purchase it.  I will quote the ingredients list from another website:<br /><br /> Other Ingredients: Nutritional yeast, calcium carbonate, whey (from milk), magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate monobasic, choline bitartrate, niacinamide, potassium chloride, d-calcium pantothenate, para aminobenzoic acid, bromelain, GTF chromium yeast, inositol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, selenium yeast, papain, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, biotin, folic aicd, potassium iodide. <br /><br />This is the same as what is on my jars' labels.  You can get the entire nutritional facts and ingredients from the Twinlab website [...]  It's a nice product at a reasonable price in a large quantity.  In fact, it's going to take me a while to go through two pounds of it (how much yeast can a guy eat?).  When I finally do finish it, I won't be ordering again due to the dairy, but if that doesn't bother you, I would actually recommend this product as it seems to be a good deal.  I gave it four stars because the dairy thing was really my fault.  I should have done some more research of my own.<br /><br />Happy shopping.
4406	5	I mix oatmeal, flax seeds, almonds and this cacao powder together every morning for breakfast. I top it off will a little almond or rice milk, and I have chocolate for breakfast every day! This powder is amazingly delicious, and is also really good for you. If you're looking for an excellent chocolate powder, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Also, I know it says 16 oz, but I was expecting two smaller bags like I had seen in my grocery store (probably 8 oz). I thought the price was a little steep when I ordered, but I just had to have it! When my order arrived, I saw that I had two GIANT bags of cacao powder that will last me forever, so I was very pleased with price and product.
4407	5	I've been a vegan for almost a year now and I use nutritonal yeast a lot. I use it to make vegan queso for my nachos, mac & cheese, sprinkled on my popcorn and I like to make a vegan version of parmesan using cashews and nutritonal yeast. I use it in a ton of recipes. MANY people love nutritonal yeast but you will either love it or hate it. You really just need to get a few recipes and try them.
4408	5	I would say the flavor is at first reminiscent of steak sauce..that's what it reminded me of anyway. So the flavor of this sauce could be better. But the heat from the Jolokia peppers really shines through. Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce honestly brings the heat and the pain so i would recommend it be used sparingly. The heat from just a taste of this sauce actually builds up and becomes hotter than the initial burn so prepare for it, but if you like it hot like me then i certainly recommend buying a bottle.
4409	2	I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I >Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I >Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0 >Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6 >SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC >Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.
4410	5	I have purchased fried garlic in Asian markets and enjoy the product.  Living in Montana, we have to travel to find such markets.  Getting it on-line was a bonus!<br /><br />Fried garlic is excellent on salad; we have made believers out of numerous guests and family that have been to our home for dinner.
4411	5	I really like this cookie. A bit dry but good the same. My granddaughter says yummy.
4412	5	This citrus grill seasoning is the best stuff I have found for giving a great taste to white fish, in fact just about any fish, and chicken. Even my kids were crazy about it.
4413	5	*****<br />Numi Tea's Golden Chai Spiced Assam Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Assam black tea, organic cinnamon, organic Chinese ginger, organic green cardamom, and organic Turkish anise. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes:  Throughout India, chai stalls are a meeting place for provocative tea and conversation. From its homeland in China, chai has journeyed as chai, th&eacute;, and tea, recreating itself in every land. Numi's golden brewed, organic Chai fuses rich cultures in a complex and hearty Assam black tea. Indian cinnamon and mild green cardamom evoke a warm balance with the vitality of Chinese ginger. The peaked, sweet aroma of Turkish anise exhilarates memories. Reminisce in aged tradition with an inspiring cup of Golden Chai. <br /><br />Although this is a  chai , note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, and the anise gives a certain type of mild sweetness, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not  sweet  in the same way that sugar is. Golden Chai is also caffeinated; if you want a caffeine-free chai, try Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan instead.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
4414	5	The product was as described, at less money than the manufacturer would have charged and it arrived in quick time, undamaged.
4415	5	I like this flavor of the Solo bar head and sholders above the others.  This has a yogurt coating that does not taste waxy, and there are dried cranberries in it too!  If you are a citrus-cranberry flavor fan (I am), then it will be a delight to have this bar as a choice in a sea of chocolate and PB based energy bars.<br /><br />I highly recommend!
4416	5	I love this baby food for my baby and I like that it is as affordable as the Gerber, preservative laden non-organic baby food when purchased on subscribe and save through Amazon. It tastes fresh and good and I like how the packaging is created to be convenient on the go. I always have these packets of food in my purse with the little screw on spoons in case my little one gets hungry while we're out.
4417	5	Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight. Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years. After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat. That may be age related as well. But the stomach upsets have stopped. And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.
4418	1	I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own.  We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food.  We buy the largest sized cans, and we spend almost $800 per month on this food.  The cats used to love all of the flavors we bought (Turkey, Chx, Chx and Beef, Turkey and Salmon) and suddenly NONE of them will eat ANY of them!  I can only surmise that something has happened to the recipe, or the quality of the ingredients.  It makes no sense.  More bizarre, we feed the outdoor (feral) cats the food and many of them won't touch it, either.  The hunt is on to find the next  great food ...
4419	3	I gave up drinking coffee because I always added creamer and sugar, thus I have been trying lots of different teas. This is a decent flavored tea, though not on the top of my list. Wish you could mix and match a case.
4420	4	People seemed to be confused about the Matcha labeling.  It's actually called Matcha blend, the tea in the bag is Sencha tea and the remaining powder in the bag after the tea bag is removed is the Matcha.  According to the label, you sprinkle the Matcha powder on your tea after it is done steeping.<br /><br />I'm no tea expert but it tastes pretty good to me and the price is right, as long as you buy it from Costco where it retails for around 12 dollars.
4421	5	In the stressful world we live in it's nice to relax with a warm cup of Natural Calm Magnesium at the end of the day - I get better results with this product than any magnesium pill I've tried.  My kids love it too and say it helps them fall asleep faster.  Arrived quick, and a better price than at the local store!
4422	5	My daughter and I are addicted to these olives -- the blue cheese are clearly the best, but we also like the citrus.  Nothing compares to this brand.  I really hope that Amazon continues selling these with prime shipping.  They are expensive, but so worth it.
4423	1	I love the taste of these cookies but they were mostly just crumbs. I bought the dark chocolate  as well and thet hold together like a normal cookie. I got a second box of the PB and they were still just crumbs and flour rather than cookies.
4424	1	The Haribo gummi bears were all stuck together and horrible. This is the worst experience that I have had with Amazon. The worst part of the whole process is that I cannot return the defective product.
4425	1	I am a frequent user of bully sticks from other vendors online and from pet stores. These are listed as  THICK  bully sticks. I usually buy thick ones from another vendor and my German Shepherd pup loves them and they last a couple of days. These arrived and I was immediately disappointed. Many of them are the thickness of a pencil or slightly thicker. They are about 1/3 the thickness of the  thick  bully sticks I usually buy. But I did not want to deal with sending them back so I gave one to my pup. It smelled HORRIBLE, like a person who had not washed in weeks. My pup liked them okay but because they are so thin she can eat an entire, 12  one in under an hour. Will NOT buy these again.
4426	3	These are very salty, and the nacho flavor on  just cheese  seems kind of redundant. The quantity in the bag is very scant. I understand that it is probably expensive to reduce cheese to these little crunchy treats.
4427	5	This  simply salted  is popcorn the way Mom used to make.  She'd pour in a little oil and shake it over the burner.  She'd add salt and yum!  Brings out the true flavor of the popcorn.<br /><br />I've tried both the regular and the reduced fat and both are good.  I hardly notice the difference in the Less Fat version.<br /><br />I cannot find this item in stores so Amazon is the way to go.
4428	1	Our Dachsund did not like this at all.  She would not eat anything that we put it on - even steak.
4429	5	Got this stuff and it looked like they just swept it off the beach . I think its still wet actually. We got the course and we grind it ourselves. We love it. We even took a taste test, first this French gray , then Mortons salt. Hands down we could taste the difference and we could taste how much better the French Gray was. I would get the fine salt next time. I wanted that but must have hit the course by accident. We still like it! You will too. Worth every dollar. And now im spoiled.
4430	5	My 15 month old loves this product. I mix this in with food he does not like, in an effort to get him to eat, and it works sometimes. If it fails, I let him have the pouch, and he sucks it right up, and begs for more.
4431	5	My best friend returned to Japan and I felt that unless I went to a Japanese restaurant, I would never, ever have real miso soup.<br /><br />I tried every paste, every color. I tried making my miso with and without wakame; I even tried mixing the pastes and still could not get it right.<br /><br />I FINALLY got it! I didn't even intend to order Hon Dashi, had it on my wish list, but it was the best mistake I could make.<br /><br />I'll be experimenting with my dashi to see what else I can add it to. The smokey flavor is superb.
4432	1	I decided to try this product after recently discovering this brand by way of Neuro sleep. I loved Neuro sleep so I figured I'd try this, (hey why not!  mental performance in every bottle! ) Well I just couldn't get passed the taste. I really wanted to like this and I really tried to throw it back hoping for another great product from this company but I just couldn't drink it.
4433	5	Red Marble Kitchen Mortar and Pestle<br /><br />What a little kitchen gem.  If you like freshly ground spices this is the way to go.  Allspice, Pepper, Cloves, Cinnamon are just a few of the spices that I use with this mortar and pestle.  When it comes to garlic and onion I use a pharmacist's glass mortar and pestle.  The reason is that marble is a porous substance and there can be a flavor carry over from one use to the next. I also use a porcelain mortar and pestle, but they are more fragile.<br /><br />To clean, wipe with a damp cloth, that works to a certain extent, but I found that using glycerin U.S.P. (anhydrous) to clean the marble works better and it helps seal the marble and clean away the residue (essential oils) of the spices better.  Now, you used to be able to buy this at the pharmacy, but since all of this terrorism scare you can't find it over-the-counter and have to ask for it or you can order it from Amazon.  It only takes about 2 ml (one-half teaspoonful) to clean the mortar and pestle. After the cleaning with glycerin, I use a damp cloth to clean further. Among other uses glycerin is used for chafed, chapped, and cracked lips and windburned skin. So, it is safe to use, it is used as a sweetening agent, and makes the marble less porous and look better. Dimensions: 3-1/4  diameter x 3  tall bowl, 4  pestle.<br /><br />I am pleased with this little kitchen aid and the aroma from the freshly ground spices it absolutely amazing and you can grind to the consistency that you need and you aren't beholden to what the manufacturers of spices believe to be the correct consistency.  Besides, who knows how long those ground spices have been around.<br /><br />An epicurean Bon Appetite
4434	1	Why is this product on the market??!!!  They taste fantastic but you will be relegated to the bathroom in about an hour if you eat anything more than a handful.  They are poison, stay away at all costs unless you already have an eating disorder.
4435	1	We just bought Tassimo Gevalia Expresso 16 pack for $9.99 less 20% off at Bed Bath and Beyond.  Why would anyone pay this price?
4436	5	Love it,love it, love it need I say more it is the perfect seasoning for roasts you need nothing else and for in stews it is perfect I will definatly buy it again.
4437	3	Taste is a personal thing. This coffee does not satisfy my personal taste. I found it rather harsh tasting and bland. Your mileage may differ.
4438	1	My dog refused to eat any of these.  I had to give them away.  Beware if your dog is picky.
4439	5	Having a delicious, hot, instant cup of coffee in the morning is the perfect picker-upper, eye-opener, and motivater to leave those toasty blankets behind.  BUT it took more than just the brewer to do all that.  We received ours for a Christmas gift along with our first pack of coffee and quickly had to order a new supply from you.  Why did the world wait so long for K-Cup Green Mountain Coffee?  We feel like kicking up our heels--at least mentally!  AMAZON, you are s-o-o-o good and up-to-date.
4440	5	My kids really enjoyed these animal crackers. I purchased them as an easy snack, to throw in the zoo bag or park backpack for busy summer days. I appreciate that they don't use refined sugar and they have whole wheat. My kids love the shapes and the taste. They taste quite good and held up well. This is my first time to try the Barbara's Bakery brand. Can't wait to try other varieties.
4441	5	My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want a healthy pet, you should do a combination of dry and wet food.<br /><br />The critics have unrealistic nutritional expectations if they are only feeding their animal dry food.
4442	1	I purchased this, thinking it to be a good product.<br /><br />However, within 3 days, my dog was itching and pulling her hair out.<br /><br />Took her off the food and her hair is coming back.<br /><br />Went to another brand immediately.
4443	3	I purchased this product online because I couldn't find it in the stores at that time (2 days later it was in the store also). It's good that comes quick, save a trip to the store, however, no deal on the price; same as Walmart, Kroger, etc.
4444	5	While living in England, I became hooked on PG Tips tea.  I love the tea and Amazon prices are always the best.
4445	5	If you let them, kids would eat this mac & cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Very tastey. Perfect portion size, too.
4446	4	I had this for lunch and I enjoyed the flavor and the spice level.  It was a little salty for my taste, but not too bad.  Some people suggest not to use the whole flavor packet to reduce the saltiness, but that would also reduce the amount of heat.  The bowl was easy to prepare and it was enough for me for lunch.  Given the hagh salt content and low nutritional value, I would eat this occasionally, not often, to satisfy a craving.
4447	5	These sardines are delicious.  They do not have a strong fishy odor or flavor.
4448	5	The Balance Bar Gold Lemon Meringue Crunch bar is a good energy bar. At 28 percent sugar, 14 grams for a 50 gram bar, it is in the lower range of sugar content for energy bars. It is not too sweet.<br /><br />The bar has a nice lemon flavor. To me, it tastes a lot like lemon meringue pie. I suggest that key lime would also make a nice flavor for this kind of bar. As the product description says,  No pie we've ever tried came with the satisfying crunch and nutritional punch delivered by this energy bar.  That may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but the bar does taste good and does have a balanced set of natural ingredients.<br /><br />One observation is that each bar weighs in at 200 calories. This makes it good for vigorous exercise, but perhaps too much to take a whole bar for a snack. On the other hand, we have been having snow storms every few days this year. I think that shoveling qualifies as vigorous exercise, so I can eat as many of these bars as I want to without worrying about calories.
4449	1	I picked up this flavor along with two of the other flavors. All 3 were the most horrible chemical-tasting garbage i've ever tasted. I can't understand how there are *any* positive reviews out there of this stuff. I can't even describe the taste other than  rancid chemical  flavor... I'm glad I sampled this before ruining my perfectly good taco, this in no way/shape/form tastes like anything i've had from Taco Bell.
4450	5	This is our favorite chicken seasoning sauce.  Add orange juice in a bag along with this sauce & chicken pieces and toss!  Easy and the chicken tastes better than El Polo Loco's!
4451	5	Yes i did say drip. I have now tried 2 different lavazza brands. This is the better of the two but do not discount the other as i love it equally. I will continue to buy both as i love the occasional change up. If you use this in a drip coffee pot i would suggest staring out with using just over half of the normal amount you usually use then move on from there. With other brands including starbucks i would use 1 - 1.5 scoops per cup. So in my 5 cup maker depending on what taste i was going after i would use up to 8 scoops. With both lavazza coffees i have found 3-3.5 scoops is ideal in my 5 cup maker. It takes a few times to get it in your head that so much less coffee works but it does.
4452	5	My cat likes many of the Whiska's Purrfectly... product line. Red snapper is one of her favorites. Can only get it at the store as part of a combination including shrimp which she doesn't like.
4453	4	I would recommend this product!  With the introduction of another cat to the household, this one from  the outside , this product has really helped.  I put it in the water dish for general comsumption and in the food of the oldest.  While we still have some fussing, it seems to working and at least 3 of the 4 cats are calm and accepting of each other.
4454	5	If you want the real thing and maybe even better then try this topping out to see for yourself.
4455	5	Not only is this a wonderful assortment of chocolate nuggets, this is a great value for the money. Hershey chocolates are creamy and the almonds are huge. The toffee pieces are tasty and plentiful as well.
4456	5	We all know we can't afford Innova or Orijen, which is one of the best foods you can possibly feed your dog. A lot of people buy Iams, myself included, for our dogs. Then there are the people who continue to buy Beneful and Old Roy and Pedigree and don't realize that you are basically buying corn, which your dog cannot digest and will essentially poop out! So you are just throwing your money into fertilizing your yard! LOL Dogfoodanalysis.com has a great rating system and reviews all dog foods and rates them with stars. 6 being the highest. To put this into perspective, Iams is a 1 star dog food, based off of its ingredients. This food, Chicken soup for the Soul is a 4 star food. Blue Buffalo is also a 4 star food, but costs twice as much! Iams sells at Walmart for $17.88 for an 18 pound bag so .99 a pound. I would typically feed my dog 2 1/2 cups of Iams. This food, as of the time of this review is $39.99 for 35 pounds,so $1.14 a pound. And I would only give my dog 2 cups. Think about it, if you ate fillers all day long and food with very little nutritional value, you are going to eat more. But if you ate food with more substance, that was healthier, you would actually eat less. This is the same for dogs. So many people run out and buy Kibble and Bits because you can get a huge bag for $10, but you end up feeding your dog 3-4 cups and blow through the bag in a matter of days. They don't realize that if they buy a better quality food, you actually feed your dog less. Not to mention they would be on a healhier diet.<br /><br />I think for the money and the quality this is an excellent dog food choice. It's middle of the road, not insanely expensive, but not super cheap. And the quality is far above par in my book.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken, turkey, chicken meal, ocean fish meal, cracked pearled barley, whole grain brown rice, oatmeal, millet, white rice, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), potatoes, egg product, tomato pomace, duck, salmon, flaxseed, natural chicken flavor, choline chloride, dried chicory root, kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberry powder, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-carnitine, Enterococcus faecieum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D supplement, folic acid.<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br />Crude Protein 24.0% Minimum<br />Crude Fat 14.0% Minimum<br />Crude Fiber 3.0% Maximum<br />Moisture 10.0% Maximum<br />Sodium 0.3% Maximum<br />Zinc 150 mg/kg Minimum<br />Selenium 0.4 mg/kg Minimum<br />Vitamin E 300 IU/kg Minimum<br />Omega-6 Fatty Acids * 2.2% Minimum<br />Omega-3 Fatty Acids * 0.4% Minimum
4457	5	I really loved this one, too!  The yogurt flavor is really creamy, and not too tart....just like a Jamba Juice smoothie.  Plus 10g PROTEIN!!!<br /><br />But try the peach, first.  That one is my favorite.  Yum!
4458	4	I love wasabi and thought I would try this product out. I hate to have to run to a restaurant every time I have a wasabi craving.<br /><br />You mix this powder with equal amounts of water, let sit 10 minutes and you've got wasabi sauce.<br /><br />It tastes good and has a good kick. It will burn your sinuses. The color isn't a bright green like I usually see in restaurant but is kind of a pale, pea-soup color but it doesn't affect the flavor.<br /><br />The texture is like when you take powdered mustard and mix with water, the texture is a little different than restaurant wasabi. It is more like a sauce than a paste.<br /><br />If the color and the texture doesn't bother you then I recommend this product, it still has all the wasabi taste.<br /><br />Amazon does sell wasabi paste on here also if you are interested in more of paste texture. I'm pleased with this product, it's great on food and since it's a powder, you can sprinkle in food like a spice. Yum!
4459	4	They are great if you are on a diet and cant snack on unhealthy stuff.  The smart fries are a great snack fix.  All the flavors are very good.
4460	2	Some of these are quite tasty, but all are too salty. Way too much sodium.<br />The cheddar flavor is kind of like different-shaped cheetos, quite tasty.<br />Parmesan garlic on the other hand is terrible. Extremely garlicky with no parmesan taste at all, and too salty.
4461	4	This worked well for my baby who is sensitive to cow's milk. It is expensive but this is the least expensive way I have found to purchase the product.
4462	5	Be warned, it does work! If you're thinking what can tea really do, the senna does the trick! (TMI alert~~~oh do I feel better!LOL!)
4463	4	If you have an espresso machine, regrinding is a must. I'm not extracting good espresso because of how absurdly coarse the coffee is, water runs through it too easily.
4464	5	Superior flavor, not too green, not too black. Loved it from the first cup.I put a hint of Splenda/Sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days. Stumbled on it in  a shop but will be getting it thru Amazon in the future. I am here now because after tasting it I wanted to be sure I could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door. Again, a definite yes product! maggiemay
4465	5	I love these oils. They can take anything, even plain oatmeal, and transform it into a delicious  gourmet  delicacy. Plus the 10-pack of individually chosen flavors is the best of both worlds--the only bad part is having to choose between all the wonderful options! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product and the service from the company was spectacular; the oils got here so quickly and in perfect condition. Thank you!
4466	1	I really wanted to like this coffee. I wanted something that I could take to the office and use with my AeroPress coffee maker or use when I wanted a quick shot of espresso without grinding the beans. However, I guess once you start drinking fresh ground you cannot go back to buying ground coffee. The date on the bottom of the can is over a year away, but the coffee still smelled stale to me when I pealed the metal top off the can. I tried it a couple times in my Saeco made espresso machine. The crema was weak and the flavor was thin and slightly bitter. I poured it down the drain rather than finish it. I prefer Illy's dark roast espresso, but my local grocer no longer carries it, probably because it did cost more than any other brand.<br /><br />I guess I should have heeded another reviewer. My favorite coffee is Peet's and I think French Roast is the peak of perfection. I like the beans dark and shiny. This coffee was a medium brown color, not the dark brown that I'm used to. There's a reason why espresso shops freshly grind the coffee, it really makes a difference and is worth the extra time, expense and effort. The Baratza Maestro Plus is an excellent cone burr grinder (...).  It will give you years of service. I've tried cheaper ones and they just eventually die.
4467	4	I love coffee and just out of curiosity requested to review this product. This product is first class all the way down to the packaging! Not only do you get a carton of coffee pods that taste great, you won't mind displaying this on your counter for all your friends to see either. I liked this coffee so much that I ended up following Marley coffee on facebook and twitter both! Organic and tasty, I suggest you try this coffee!
4468	1	I hated this K-cup and couldn't wait to be done with the box.  (We hate wasting unless toxic.)  So while not toxic, the best I can say for this variety is that it tastes like bitter, yet weak  sock water .  Now, after reading the many good reviews this blend has received, I'm apprehensive to trust the reviews of the other K-cup varieties.
4469	5	I purchased these silver star edible glitters for some cupcakes. The cupcakes turned out beautifully and just looked amazing. We were very pleased.
4470	5	These chips are absolutely incredible!!!  They are so good and so flavorful!!  My favorite is the barbecue flavor!  The best part, they are ALL NATURAL!! Definitely will purchase these again!!!
4471	5	It was my first time rolling fondant and I did it for my 3 years old daughter's birthday. It was perfect! I used for a big cake. It was pretty challenge on rolling it at that big size but it was worth.<br /><br />I researched on few tips on line and used a rolling mat so it was easy to transfer from the table to the cake.
4472	5	Hot chocolate and hot instant oatmeal in packets have taken a back seat to this soup and I can say that the low sodium version has a great taste as I've had the regular Red Pepper and Tomato by Pacific Naturals.  I stock cartons at work and by mid-morning and mid-day, microwave a cup and find it most satisfying.  Big smile for a fine soup.
4473	5	Biting into a Pocket Caffe is a surprise and a pleasure.  The interior expresso blends with dark chocolate in your mouth.  I try to hold onto to that delightful treat as long as possible.
4474	2	Our lab received this for Christmas. She loved the toy carrying it around all day licking or chewing on the treat cap. A couple of hours into the treat we noticed she would hack / cough as if a piece of the treat was caught in her throat and she needed water. Nothing alarming as her cough quickly cleared what was bugging her and she continued to feast on her treat. We noticed this happened a couple more times throughout the day. I picked up the treat to inspect it and the flavor cap was coming apart in pinch sized pieces. The blue portion was intact and was not showing signs of strain. The smell of the flavor cap was horrible, made me almost vomit but my dog loves it. Then we noticed our dog wasn't feeling so well. She had excessive gas that was room clearing. I looked up what could be causing this and most say its due to a diet change or low quality food being feed to the dog. I saw all kinds of remedy suggestions from rice and veggies to pepto. Her stool is soft but still firm so I am not alarmed. We are just going to ride out the effects and she will just play with the blue portion of her toy.  We feed our dog Blue Buff food so this large flavor cap could be a much lower quality resulting in her digestion issues.
4475	4	I read the previous reviews for this scalp balm; I'm glad that I decided to get it anyway. There are a number of ingredients in here that would make one think that this would be heavy, but it wasn't. As someone who deals with dry scalp, I'm always looking for hair/scalp oils to use. Sometimes, I  miss the mark and get something that weighs my hair down, and makes it overly oily. Considering that this is hair  grease  this was light and fluffy, compared to the others that I've  used. It had a pleastant smell, and didn't make my hair greasy. I put it in my hair 3 days ago, and I haven't had any itching. I will happily use tyhe rest of my sample and buy some more
4476	5	What a great deal, love the Kuerig cups!  One of my favorite flavors!  Will definately order again.  Best price around.
4477	5	We recommend buying the coffee pods through Amazon. They cost less than at the manufacturer's site.
4478	5	I love granola, and probably go through a box or two every few weeks.  One of my favorite brands has been Kashi since it's pretty healthy overall, and doesn't have a lot of added sugar.  This KIND granola, however, takes the cake: it's one of the best-tasting commercial granolas I've tried!<br /><br />Granola can often be high in fat, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that one serving of this (1/3 cup) has only 3 grams of fat (5% of your daily value).  While it still has the typical higher calorie counts that granolas usually have, coming in at 120 calories, it's really high in fiber (5g, or 20%). The ingredients are all-natural, and, overall, it's a really healthy option if you like granola.<br /><br />A granola isn't worth its weight in grain, however, if it doesn't taste good, and this one is delicious!  Even my husband, who's not a huge granola lover, really liked this one when we were sampling it, and he came back for more.<br /><br />I also like how this has nice, big clusters, so that you can actually grab some out of the bag and snack on it.  Granolas that have smaller clusters have to be mixed into cereal or eaten with milk, but not this one.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be delicious and am happy to have been able to try this out. I will definitely re-purchase it!
4479	5	Excited to have been able to find this candy as have been looking for ages. Was received very quickly and the candy was well packaged and fresh flavor.Will buy again. Thank you.
4480	5	Easy to prepare and healty for my dog. She loves all fruits & veggies so this works well. No big container to keep it in, bag is perfect & easy to work out of.
4481	5	I use <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI >Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a>in most of my cooking now. It is cold pressed and is healthier than  other oils. It gives cookies, brownies, vegetables, eggs,smoothies a slightly sweet taste. Love this product. I use one jar per month on average. Amazon pricing better than at the local grocery.
4482	5	If you like k-cup quality coffee, then Van Houtte is the best quality for a k-cup brewer.<br /><br />All K-cup coffee, even Van Houtte brand k-cup coffee does not taste as good as regular style home brewed coffee or coffeehouse coffee.
4483	4	I can see why plenty of people will think this is the best coffee ever. It's some of the smoothest, least bitter coffee I've ever tasted. The aroma is also delicious. Opening the bag and taking a whiff right away is a must if you want to try this.<br /><br />But I'm the type of coffee drinker who loves it black, so I need a coffee with a rich flavour on its own. I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though.
4484	5	It was exactly what I wanted for my husband who is a huge candy lover! All the candy was fresh and we had a blast enjoying all the  old school  candy.
4485	1	This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn't find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful. save your money and buy any other tea out there.
4486	5	I ordered the 22 to 24 inch bone for my dog. It arrived quickly and was more like 36 to 40 inches which was nice. The dog really liked it. It costs a lot to ship so I would only go this route if you cant go to a store. (I am in Iraq) The company had great fast service, if they sell other things that ship cheaper than a 4 foot bone I will use them again.
4487	4	This is a really great snack for kids.  The fact that they are organic is a big plus and it takes no arm-twisting at all for the kids to eat them.  Only complaint I have is that they are a bit expensive.
4488	5	I'm so excited about these cookies! They taste incredible and the concept of pairing with wine is so fun. I love the individual packaging because they can be a real treat for my husband and me after dinner without entailing a huge dessert. Friends of ours in Wisconsin bake for company, so I know the quality of ingredients and baking process is nothing but the best. You will not be sorry you splurged on these!
4489	5	Really enjoy all the Vigo rice mixes. Perfectly seasoned, quick & easy to prepare. Good for quick dinners for two, for sides, or for burritos/mexican food. Add meats to transform into main dish. Very economical and stores for a couple of years. If you like beans and rice at all, you should enjoy these.
4490	5	Arrived on time.  What a deal !!! So glad I could find this product on amazon !  I used this when i feel like im getting sick<br />Thanks !
4491	4	As mentioned by another reviewer, this did not arrive vacuum packed and I suspect this item may have been older stock.  Grinds into a decent cup of coffee but not one to savor.  Perhaps I am a bit jaded having been recently spoiled with several pounds of rich full bodied coffee beans.<br /><br />I give this the benefit of the doubt and 4-stars.  Although bland, it is drinkable and not overly acidic.  The most important factor for me, is that I got a great price for this.
4492	5	I normally have beef jerkey with my lunch for some easy to transport protein. I decided to give these a try, bought them at the grocery store and they were great. Easy to measure and a lot less stringy than normal beef jerkey.<br /><br />I ended up saving a ton of money using amazons subscribe and save over using the grocery store. Definitely something I'll reorder.
4493	4	For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.
4494	1	I don't trust dog treats made in China.  As an alternative, there's a good chicken jerky dog treat made by Goodness Gracious - in the USA and using 100% human grade chicken.  [...]
4495	3	These are not bad, but the product description says  Melissa's Soy Nuts, Salted,  and the delivered product is not salted. Not exactly the healthier substitute for salted nuts that we were hoping for.
4496	5	My little one loves these and you cannot beat the subscribe & save price!  It's a better price than any sale at a retail store!
4497	3	I haven't been as excited as I thought I would be by these bars, but this one stands out as my favorite.  If they were so expensive, I might get more of this flavor.  I guess I was expecting something that was a bit less dry, but as a standby for hard workout days or on-th-go, I'll buy again.
4498	5	Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w/ European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews.
4499	5	I was told by a friend that Biscoff spread is amazing and I can confirm that it is. If you like nutella you'll probably like Biscoff. It has a hint of saltiness that makes it quite good. I haven't tried the cookies yet, but I'm sure they're amazing too. By the way the spread was atleast a couple of dollars cheaper at Cost Plus.
4500	1	Made in China! Food quality and growing conditions concern me.  Packages are full of small broken pieces. Couldn't tell how many of each fruit were in the 12 count variety box. Thought there'd be 4 of each flavor...Only 2 pears and 2 strawberries - rest were apples.  Taste is very good but never would have bought if I'd known the origin. Not sure where packaging failed but broken tiny pieces aren't what my 1-year old grandson wants. USA doesn't have fruit???  Won't buy again.
4501	2	Don't know if I just got a bad batch or something, but the package I received had such a strong chemical smell, and my dog seemed to like them okay at first, but then was drinking water like crazy, and puked it back up a few hours later...
4502	5	I purchased these on a whim (as with most of my Amazon buys!) thinking they would be nice for snack time in my busy household.  The kids and I both are crazy about them!  They're the perfect size for a 4 or 5 year old's snack.  They're also easy enough to open that my 4 and 5 year olds can open the package themselves.  Our favorite variety is of course chocolate.  Love having these around for trips to the zoo, on the way to the store, or to throw in the lunchbox.  Will be buying these again!
4503	5	*****<br />This Fasting Tea from Yogi Tea for Weight Loss Support is  designed to promote healthy functioning of the stomach and intestines, and to help you feel more energetic while you lose weight.  Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States.<br /><br />It's suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I'm not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don't care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits:  Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we've included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins.  Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****
4504	3	I purchased these about 2 weeks ago along with the Sour Patch Green Apple ones which i did a review on and once again these really lack the sour that Sour Patch is known for. However these do have a good watermelon flavor but still lack a good sour flavor. If you lick a good gummy watermelon flavor then this aren't as bad. I would try a small package 1st before buying a bigger one to see if it's what your taste buds want.
4505	5	Our dog has tried several foods, including expensive vet brands, and has been treated for ear infections, skin infections, and was constantly scratching and licking. We even tried other limited ingredient foods, only to have it upset her stomach and cause new problems. I bought this at the store thinking,  Okay, salmon and rice. This seems safe!   I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach. It is sometimes hard to find in the pet stores so I'm buying on Amazon again. It saves running all over town, and the price is lower.
4506	3	I bought these for my pitbull puppy since he feels the need to chew everything in sight. These are not as thick/strong as regular bully sticks so he can go through one in about 5 minutes. On the plus side they dont smell awful so I guess its kind of a trade off. Not bad for the price.
4507	4	I looooove these chips. Super tasty. Just got to watch out for how much salt it has, and sometime not every bag gets the same amount of flavor dusting. Seriously though, even with a dud bag or two I like the taste and the protein that I can get from munching!
4508	5	I was hesitant about this powder form peanut butter, but, I must say I am pleasantly surprised how good this is. It's the same wonderful taste without all the oil. My favorite is to use it in the protein drink after a workout. I highly recommend!
4509	3	We love these crackers and they are a great alternative to the major brands' fish shaped ones.  The little bag is convenient too.  However, at more than $2 a teeny little bag that is just way too expensive for our budget.  You could buy the regular size box for almost the same price and dole them out into your own baggies.
4510	5	This stuff is completely fantastic! It's the only completely peanut & dairy free almond spread out there and it is soooo yummy! What a great company for people with allergies. Now my son can actually eat nut butter and jam sandwiches. They also have other products that you can find on their website. p.s. when they say crunchy, they mean crunchy. There are a lot of almond pieces in it. Which I love but I'm also excited to try the smooth kind. :) Happy Eatin!
4511	5	The packaging, the box as well as the individual pods, is attractive to the point where it would make a great gift for any coffee drinker and especially a coffee drinking Bob Marley fan.  I liked the coffee, it smelled and tasted very good and the individually sealed pods assure long term freshness.  The pods appear to be made of high quality unbleached paper and it is strong enough to not tear or break open when saturated with hot water.  I do not own a single serve drip coffee maker so my first try was to open four pods and pour the coffee into my four cup basket and filter.  This worked well.  Then I thought I'd try something different the next time and placed four pods into my coffee maker basket.  This resulted in an entirely too weak brew.  But my experiment led me to discover the best method for using the handy little pods when no one cup maker is available.  When I saw that I had a pot of hot weak coffee I took the pods out of the basket and dropped them into the hot coffee.  I let them sit and steep for a while then plucked each pod out, squeezed, and discarded.  Now I had a good brew, as good as my first.  From then on when I use these pods I place one pod with about 8 oz of distilled water in a ten ounce mug and heat it good and hot in the microwave.  Remove from microwave and cover to retain heat while it brews.  Then squeeze out and discard the pod (they are so easy to deal with compared to loose wet grounds) and you have yourself a great cup of coffee.  All said I am enjoying this coffee as something new to me but I still prefer mu old standby, 100% Colombian.
4512	2	These prunes were not what I was expecting from Sun Maid. When I buy them locally they are plump an as juicy as a dried fruit can be. These came in a 4 pack and most of them were dried up little hard nuggets. Not very good at all. Will go back to buying them locally I guess.
4513	2	I love granola and I love Kind products but the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters were not a favorite of mine. The blueberry flavor was great. Tasted like fresh blueberries but the vanilla taste was a little off and the granola itself tasted a little stale. It didn't have a balanced flavor either. I was either hit with blueberry, vanilla or oats. The flavors competed instead of complimenting.
4514	5	I had to give a rating in order to make a comment.  I really like EDEN ORGANIC BEANS.  I have used them for many years.  I usually purchased them locally when available.  However, the beans that I just received from this online source are out-of-date.  The black beans have 2008 expiration dates and the pinto beans have 2007 expiration dates.  Check the dates before you open them. I just cooked one package of beans before thinking to check the date.  I thought that would not even be an issue since I was ordering them direct.  What is going on here?  Mine have such old dates that I don't know if I should use the rest of them.
4515	4	I keep a can of this poppable snack on my desk to nibble when I need a quick boost of spicy, crunchy goodness.  Just a few, slammed back like popcorn, have enough punch to open my eyes and get my mind back on the work.  The peas themselves have a light flavor, neither bland nor overpowering, that really carries the kick of the wasabi.<br /><br />If I had to muster one complaint, it's the presence of the word  hot  on the can in fire-red letters.  Though these peas are pleasantly spicy, I've had much hotter.  This spice, while tasty, is fairly mild.  So don't purchase this snack expecting it to light up your life.  Just expect it to taste good and keep you going through the long, boring day.
4516	5	These are the best gluten-free cookies that I have ever tasted.  They are as good as the regular wafer cookies (or better!).  The only problem is that in shipment (during the summer months) the chocolate all sticks to the paper and the container that the cookies are in.  If they could be put on ice packs for shipment, they would get to the customer in much better shape.
4517	1	I ate the last bowl today of 7 whole grain Kashi and the last shake of the box which had an experation date of October 2008 exposed the insect, not sure what kind of bug it was, but I know its not whole grain anything!
4518	5	The 500 Mile Chai is just wonderful - the right balance of mellowness and spiciness.  I've tried some chai's that are a bit too spicy, but this one is very well balanced.  Great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic (in as much as one can trust the  organic  label...).<br /><br />Compare to Peet's chai, I like the 500 mile better, as IMO Peet's is a little too much on the spicy side (although I do still like Peet's and some may prefer that flavor profile).
4519	5	This product is amazing. The smell as soon as the bag is open is heavenly - such a 'real' chocolate aroma. And the taste is so much better!<br />It is promoted as being able to brew just like coffee - that is you can use it in a drip machine or french press. But it doesn't 'taste' like coffee - this is full on chocolate tasting!!  Personally I dont like it made with water, I prefer the creaminess of a hot chocolate made with milk.  But i do make the concentrate as per instructions on their website - mix some Crio Bru (quite a bit!) with sugar and water - boil and simmer to make a cacao concentrate that can be added to anything for a chocolate fix.  Even poured over ice cream!  And that it has no sugar or fat (marginal) of its own - it is guilt free, which you just cant believe as you take a sip - the flavour is so much fuller, stronger, smoother than any hot chocolate or even candy bar I've had. And I'll happily give them up and live on Crio Bru!  The only down side is that being ground cacao beans, you do need to strain any liquid drinks or syrups you make - although they grind is quite edible on its own if you dont mind a bit of 'roughage'. It is great added into granola or the like 'raw' straight from the pouch.
4520	4	I love this coffee. It tastes fantastic. 5 stars without a doubt. I have to take a star away because of the delivery. Amazon's delivery service here in Jersey City, NJ never delivers to my address. They deliver to a street with a similar name. Instead of 72 ***** Ave, they deliver to ?? ****** St. There is no 72 on the street. The street names are pronounced similarly, but spelled pretty different. 5 times I've had this problem. The courier always shows up with an attitude because he gets yelled at for messing up. I wont be ordering this from amazon anymore until their shipping issues are dealt with. I pay for Prime and it's taken over a week and  2 resends to get my coffee.
4521	5	I baught a 6 pack of this and let me tell you it does relax you. I enjoy a cup of this a few hours after dinner it helps me sleep better. The natural way!
4522	4	Great for a quick protein snack, wasn't super crazy about the flavor, but not bad! So convenient for grab and go people like me!
4523	4	This is the best coffee for my Keurig because I can have a nice bold cup of coffee at a decent price.  Most k- cups are not bold enough for me so this is good.  Having auto shipping is the icing on the cake.
4524	5	Out of all the t-discs that I have purchased this has got to be my favorite.  It costs a little more but it is worth every penny.  Great flavor, blends well with a variety of creamers and I love it.
4525	5	I adore this stuff. Sure, if you just chug it by itself you're going to know that this isn't a French chocolate ganache; it's saltier than actual chocolate syrup, with a slightly different flavor. HOWEVER, this stuff is A-MAZ-ING when mixed into smoothies. I imagine it would also work really well on ice cream or in a glass of chocolate milk. Tonight I drank a protein shake with a few squirts of this in it, and I couldn't tell that it wasn't real chocolate.<br /><br />You really can't go wrong here. If you love chocolate but not the calories in chocolate, GET THIS.
4526	5	We adopted our dog last summer and have tried various dog foods including the small breed formula from this same company. This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.<br /><br />If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs. The pieces are flattish disks about 3/16  thick and 3/8  or so in diameter. They vary some.
4527	3	Our company received this item very quickly.  However, the taste of this product, not so good.  I will definitely be going back to the Maxwell House, house blend.  This one is very tart and does not go well with coffee flavoring.  Nobody here cares much for it.
4528	3	These k cups are great for being green!  I love less plastic and don't get grounds in my cup. That being said the coffee is pretty good.  It's hard to find a really strong K cup coffee that's not burnt or harsh tasting.  This one is pretty close to being smooth.  I wish Amazon would offer B***sta kcups on auto delivery!
4529	2	The idea of using less plastic in a k-cup is a great idea.  But... the flavor of the coffee is not very good.  The filter design fits in the k-cup processers well but alot of grind residue is released into the coffee.  You end up with a less than desirable cup of joe.  The idea might work...it just requires a little more improvement and product testing.
4530	1	If you look at my reviews, you will see that I love buying treats for my doggies and recommend many great treats. However, these were way too hard and sharp! I was a bit worried when I gave them to my doggies, and it turned out that I was right to be worried, because my terrier mix broke a tooth which needs to be extracted now. Buyer beware!
4531	3	The ingredients are wholesome, and are without by-products, but my four cats do not really like this catfood.  It is a shame because the price is reasonable, and I like the quality, but my cats and I don't argue over 'taste.'
4532	3	Having tried all of the Taco Bell bottled sauces, I have to say this is my least favorite. The chipotle flavor is very powdery, almost chalky, and the overall taste is extremely strong. You don't have to use much of it, literally 1-2 drops on a taco is all you would need, but I found it unpleasant. The other flavors are smooth and well balanced, but the chipotle flavor just doesn't cut it. The consistency of the sauce is good and it lasts a good long time in the fridge, and the 8-oz bottle goes a lot farther than you think it will.
4533	4	I like these bars but strangely, they don't really taste like chocolate or orange. They have a very strong orange-y smell (like concentrated orange oil, orange extract, or lots of orange zest) and a zest-like flavor but again, not quite orange or chocolate. But I like them. Weird I guess but they're moist and dense and you can't beat the unctuous quality of a snack that feels naughty, fills you up, and yet is healthy and natural and actually good for you. I'm starting to really like Larabars and hope to try more flavors.
4534	5	It's great to find a grain free product that is actually appealing to my cats.  They are excited about food again.
4535	5	We're not really coffee experts, but have tried a few brands/roasts. This Lavazza Crema e Gusto has to be the best cup of coffee I've had. We've only used it in our drip maker so far, but will give it a try in our pump espresso maker soon. Yum, and highly recommended.
4536	2	First they get me hooked on this stuff with the following ingredients:<br /><br />Acetyl-L-Carnitine<br />L-Phenylalanine<br />5-Hydroxytryptophan<br />L-Theanine<br />Eleutherococcus senticosus<br />Rhodiola rosea<br />Gingko biloba<br />chamomile<br />(plus B vitamins)<br /><br />And they change it to this:<br /><br />Phosphatidylserine<br />L-theanine<br />Choline Alphosecrate<br />Chamomile<br />(and B-vitamins)<br /><br />And it tastes weirder now, too.<br /><br />Can I get Neuro Bliss Classic, please?
4537	5	Am very limited in what I can eat, and this product is a definite keeper. Is easily and very quickly prepared. Left-overs store very nicely, and this is yet another  product I cannot find where I live, so am doubly grateful that Amazon carries this.
4538	5	I am sure I am the only one with this problem, but I have a tendency to eat to many of these darn things.  The packaging of these really helps with this problem.  As long as you do not open more than 1 package then these are the perfect serving / snack size.
4539	1	I almost stopped giving my son iron drops thinking that this product was giving him much of his daily iron needs. The sweet potato/pumpkin flavor says it contains 45% of the daily iron needs but really it only has 2%. I don't understand how this company can just lie on the nutrition label.
4540	5	These apricot fruit strips are natural and low in calories. They are sweet but not too much so, and have a good apricot taste. They are a little sticky, but great for a quick snack - and healthy, too! With the subscribe and save option through Amazon, they are an even better price, too.
4541	5	I love pasta glad I saw there is Brown Rice! I don't have wheat anymore! That's a good thing Think I've lost weight cus I;\'ve changed the foods I eat now :D I break them up to small pieces in the bag! Use my knee to snap in half then half again! Wish I had done this before with other Spaghetti, makes it soooo much easier! I don't have tomatoes anymore! sometimes I'll put Tahini <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5LOO >Roland Tahini (Pure ground  Sesame seed), 16-Ounce can (Pack of 4)</a> And Almond Butter <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009OXF6I >Almond Butter, 12 oz.</a> YUM!
4542	1	I read some of the other reviews about worms but thought it might have been a bad batch so I ordered anyways. I WAS WRONG! There were still worms in them. I have bought this product several times and this is the first time I have had this problem.
4543	5	I regularly purchase this coffee in orders of  2  - so that I qualify for free shipping.  It can take up to 10 days - but I order early.<br /><br />The coffee itself is not a dark roast.  It's a medium/light roast that gives full flavor without any bitterness for a drip coffee.<br /><br />Fantastic and satisfying.
4544	5	I've never prepared kidney beans before, until recenlty.  Eden Organic's  k'beans are very well packaged and are of a consistent quality. So easy to cook and at a price that makes it an almost no-brainer in what to buy, particularly when compared to commercially canned varieties. FWIW, Eden's dry black beans are of equal quality.<br /><br />-Will keep eating 'em.
4545	1	Two of my friends and I tried these tablets with some pickles - none of us could detect any difference in the taste. Total waste of money.
4546	5	We (three Sicilians) ate the bottarga straight from the package last night. It is delicious. If you don't know what bottarga is, it is made from tuna eggs, salted and dried. It can be used to make a delicious pasta: saute garlic, parsley and hot pepper in olive oil, have some grated bottarga ready, add to oil mixture and toss pasta (linguini or spaghetti are fine) in olive oil mixture and serve with some grated bottarga as garnish. Couldn't be simpler. Remove the skin from the bottarga before using. This bottarga came from Sardenia but it tastes exactly like the bottarga from Sicily.
4547	5	such a great product!  it is so yummy!  I love that it has a hint of sweet to it but is super healthy.  the otherday I made pancakes with it and forgot to add sugar, i didn't even taste a difference.  I would highly reccomend this product.
4548	5	I love the taste of this coffee.  It is light but still has a very nice flavor and color, not bitter at all.
4549	4	My two domestic Bengals love this treat.  They scarf them right up, even when they're not hungry.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the price is sky high for what you get.  I understand why I guess.  My son told me that I could can up real chicken and give those as treats.  I haven't canned chicken because the flavor suffers a bit, so I microwave chicken breasts after cutting them into bite-size pieces, refrigerate them and it serves the exact same purpose and is more affordable.  I take some out, microwave them so they're not cold and just serve them on a paper plate to my babies and they love it and it's the real thing AND I can afford it.  Obviously the Liv-a-Little treats are wonderful, if you're wealthy and can afford it.  We're on a fixed income so I am opting to cook the real thing and serve that as their treats.
4550	3	Very crisp and tough, does not melt, but  breaks down into pretty large particles in your mouth.  I enjoy it as a cereal, but neither of my 11 mo old twins<br />really enjoy the tough texture.  They like the melt in your mouth and less sugary taste of the happy baby <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXHY8Y >HAPPYBABY Organic Puffs, Banana Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXM3I0 >HAPPYBABY Organic Puffs, Greens Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> which is almost salty.<br />They also love saltine or ritz crackers Annies brand and those saltines are just as hard to chew and great for teething on.
4551	4	As always, the coffee was excellent.  Just wish the price would go down on these, although this purchase I thought was reasonable.
4552	5	Dont go into this thinking after you mix up your peanut butter that it will taste like what you are familiar with. It wont. This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact, most of the oil from the peanut is pressed out of this as well. This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet. I would recommend however that if you planning to use this exclusively for sandwiches and are concerned about the lack of sweetness, that you try a brand like Justin's instead. For me though, this is pretty much perfect.<br /><br />Enjoy!
4553	5	I love this tea! Although I'm a sweet tea lover, this tea is not too sweet but sweet enough to satisfy your taste buds. I used to buy it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but they don't carry it anymore. It's not overly flavored with lemon--just the right amount. Out of all the teas and coffees I have, this one always runs out first.
4554	5	Well, I didn't actually eat one, but my faithful Golden Retriever did. The thing with dogs is, they eat pretty indiscriminately. How do I know this dog biscuit is any better than any other dog biscuit? He eats them all! Open the bag and smell. Most dog treats smell horrendous. I was very surprised at the non-offensive odor of these. Yes, the idea of organic all healthy treats appeals to me too. But mainly, they won't stink up my car if I take them with me someplace. They are a nice size for bigger dogs, but have scores on them so you can break them up to smaller sizes. Nice packaging too, with a zipper top. I like that much better than a box that comes open constantly. We give'em five woofs!
4555	1	My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight.  He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat.  When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach.  VERY scary and upset me greatly.  I do NOT recommend these bones.  There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing.  Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt.
4556	4	They are not the tastiest cereals but I think people forget that they can not be compared to regular cereals as they are ment for people with allergies. My son is allergic to almost everything and he tried all available gluten free cereals and therse are his favourite ones. He eats it with milk or by itself as a snack. he likes it more then rice crispies or fruit pebbles. I tried them and I think they tast just fine:)))) and the price here is better then online stores .
4557	5	This is a great product and the people who sent it to me provide a quick efficient service.
4558	2	I found this too sweet. Am hoping there's an unsweetened version available. Not very chocolatey too, kinda like Swiss miss.
4559	5	I have dropped almost 20 lbs since the beginning of July through a mixture of bootcamp and diet.  My morning Superfood smoothie has been a huge part in that.  Greek yogurt, milk (lactose intolerant use Almond Milk), any sweetners you desire, a scoop of superfood, chia seeds for each fiber, and BAM.  Everything you need in a quick and easy breakfast smoothie that's less than 250 calories (depending on what you add in, of course).  Greek yogurt has almost 50% of you daily protein serving so this will keep you happy for hours.<br /><br />I opted for the ORAC because of the sweetness added in and that it still has a high concentration of greens & fruits/veggies.  The regular Superfood will still give you the highest amount so I call this second best, nutrition-wise.
4560	4	Energy drinks are pretty common these days and tend to contain the same main ingredients (sugar, caffine, taurine) so it really comes down to how they taste and do they give you a kick.  On the taste side this one has a kind of light fruity taste that I found pretty refreshing.  It did not taste very  energy drinky .  On the kick side I really didn't notice much, certainly no more that the average Red Bull or Monster - but your mileage may vary.  I'd recommend trying it for the taste and you may end up liking it.
4561	5	This peanut butter is INCREDIBLY GOOD it is very chunky. If you are a freak for<br />chunky peanut butter like I am you will love this peanut butter.<br />And considering the price of peanut butter these days , this is an<br />incredible deal.<br />I was addicted to this peanut butter it's that good.<br />I subscribed to this Peanut Butter and they sent 2 HUGE jars of<br />this every other week.  I am not sure if they still offer that option butif<br />they do you should hurry and signup.<br />can't beat this bargain anywhere and they deliver the product well packaged<br />and on time every month.
4562	5	Smooth, delicious, can't wait to wakeup with my coffee! I love all the Wolfgang Puck coffee flavors...never a dull flavor!
4563	4	Only 4 stars because chow mein noodles in a cello bag will never match getting them from a restaurant. These are the next best thing, however. And these are the better wider noodles with good flavor, not the thin hard La Choy type that you usually find in supermarkets.
4564	1	Maybe I received the expired batch from five years ago, but this stuff is tasteless. It takes two K-cups to make a normal strength cup of decaf. I wonder if Emeril samples the products that bear his name? I will avoid his picture from now on! Timothy's decaf is just great- I'll stick with that I guess.
4565	5	I am a big fan of popcorn snacks...and these Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn are perfect for my tastes.  The caramel coating is just right...not too thick or thin.  It's a perfect coating of caramel deliciousness, with a dark chocolate drizzle on top.  It is light and satisfying.  Not too heavy and overly sweet like some caramel corn.  It's perfect for putting in the work lunchbox.  Mine showed up in the Amazon box on my front step warm from sitting in the sun, and the combination of warm dark chocolate and caramel on the popcorn was amazing.
4566	5	Okay I am a soda drinker in some cases 1 litter a day plus. Then sodastream came across my tv screen. I was like okay it sounds great.When I found this my local store and saw the price for the unit. I said wow that is a big jump $130 plus to just buy the unit then you gotta buy the charging cartridges  co2  and bottles then the syrup all told it was near 200 to get me started and ready to go. So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull
4567	5	Even though these are reduced sugar, they still are very tasty and sweet. There are three varieties in the pack. The peanut butter version is my favorite in the assortment, but the chocolate chip and cookies & cream versions are also quite tasty.<br /><br />I like that the texture is a little firmer than the regular Quaker bars. Still soft and chewy, but the bar holds together better. It's also less sticky than other bars I've tried (although it still is sticky to the touch).<br /><br />While the nutritional content is certainly far from perfect, it's a much better snack than a candy bar, especially with regard to calories (100 to 120 per bar depending on the variety). Definitely worth a look if you want a lower cal but still tasty snack bar.
4568	2	I did not care for the texture of this shampoo, or the way it felt during use or after.  As others have noted it is harsh and left mey hair feeling coated and unnatural.  I prefer a more gentle and natural product.
4569	2	Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M. Martin
4570	1	This is my fourth order from Amazon for single serve cereals. I love the convenience of having a fresh bowl each time I open a new box. I usually consume about two to four a week so opening a large box is a waste since I don't like the stale taste.<br /><br />The order came in a very timely manner. The box was well packed and protected. The cereal fresh and tasty. I will order this again and again. Thanks Amazon.
4571	1	This product was a horrible experience. First of all it taste terrible, but I could over look that if it worked. It may wake some people up but it also makes you feel absolutely sick.  I became horribly ill after. I was very very tired, but couldn't sleep. I had horrible hot flashes until I wanted to crawl outside and lay in the snow. I was so dizzy I could barely walk.  I tossed and turned in bed for  12 hours! Then when I woke up the next day it was like I'd been drugged.  I was too out of it to even drive my daughter to school.  If my mom hadn't been there I don't know what I would have done because I could not function the night before. In the morning I was irritable beyond belief and horribly sick to my stomach.  I am not a person who is sensitive to medications or vitamins.  I called a friend of mine who I knew had taken it and he told me that he took for for a while and then one day the exact same thing happened to him.  He was so hot he took a cold shower but was so dizzy he fell!  This stuff has not been looked over by the fda (not that they do such a great job) and they do not have potential side effects listed. So just beware!
4572	5	I was a little skeptical at first since they are gluten free and all, but it turned out much better than expected.  My husband could not even tell that it was a gluten free cookie that he was eating.  When I made it the second time, I did add more chocolate chips in it, and they love them even more.
4573	5	If you are looking for a tasty salad dressing with 0 calories, o carbs & 0 sugar, look no futher!  I love Walden Farms packets of 0 Calories dressings, and they are so easy to put in your purse to use when you go out to eat !!!
4574	5	This is the best stroganoff since Natural Touch...I use the boca crumbles to make it vegetarian.<br />It could use a few more noodles.
4575	5	I have tried to buy my cats  better  treats than pounce many times and they always turn their nose up.  But they both love these!
4576	5	Zhena's Gypsy tea is BY FAR the BEST tea on the market.  I have tried almost all of their tea flavors and LOVE them all.  My favorite way to drink tea is loose leaf though I have purchased BOTH their loose leaf teas and tea bags (so I can take Zhena's with me wherever I go) from Zhena's.  I highly recommend Zhena's Organic teas to certified tea lovers, such as myself, and those who are just trying tea for the first time.  You WON'T be disappointed.  Thank you Zhena's.
4577	4	I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of  brown  chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.
4578	2	This is a great and attentive company (attends to your emails and concerns)however, this particular fish is somewhat dry.  For King salmon it is supposed to be oily, this is not.  The fish comes in a pouch more like canned tuna.  It is just ok, but I would not purchase this again for the price.  Very similar to Chicken of the Sea tuna.
4579	5	We used to eat this all the time when I was growing up, but sadly they have taken it off the market in my area.  I love the tangy sauce it makes with its herbs and spices mixture.  It is inexpensive, and makes enough to feed a family of 4.  It is also low calorie..you get a cup of prepared spaghetti for only 240 calories!  I am so glad I found this Kraft mix on Amazon.com.  Delicious!!!
4580	5	I don't know if I've been depriving my cats, but the first time I opened a can of this Flaked Fish & Shrimp Feast they were already swarming me.  I had to drop off the dish and back off quickly as they pounced and devoured the food.  Not a drop of seafoody goodness was left behind.
4581	1	My dogs want nothing to do with this ring.  Unfortunately, I've found it to be a waste of money.  Better luck to others!
4582	5	These are a must if your pet needs medication.  This price seemed a little high, but they are worth it.
4583	5	This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results.
4584	5	If you like chocolate, coffee, & need a pick me up.... this will do the trick! Warning: start off with a couple at a time until you know your tolerance level. They are potent.
4585	5	We usually have to travel to China Town to buy this product and was so happy to have found it on Amazon. It was sent to us quickly and we love this tea which is very good for us. We would order from this company again. Thanks
4586	1	Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.
4587	5	Our dog loves this brand. We used their Chicken & Rice formula for about a year & decided to switch to the Lamb & rice one after our dogs interest-level started going down. How did we find out?  We realized that over time we have been mixing more treats in her food to get her to eat it  (This with only 2 meals a day!)<br /><br />Our dog definitely preferred lamb over the chicken, no more treat mix-in's, only pure dog-food!<br /><br />We = Canidae fans for life!
4588	5	This catnip was a tremendous hit with all of my cats! Nice chunky buds on the stems that my cats seem to prefer to the powdered catnip. Good packaging and I'll definitely be ordering this product again.
4589	3	One of my cats is a picky eater and this is the only wet food that she will willingly eat. One thing I do not like about this food is that if there are any bits left on the dish when it goes into the dishwasher, they turn into tiny, pale, stringy pieces that clog up the holes in the dishwasher's sprayer arm.<br /><br />I am also disappointed that Fancy Feast uses general meat by-products (it's not specifically chicken or turkey or beef...it could be a mixture of anything!) and they add cheap, synthetic vitamin K3 (menadione sodium bisulfite complex) to their food. They should be able to use higher quality ingredients with the way the Elegant Medleys line is priced. Because of this I am trying to find a new favorite for my cat.
4590	2	I am always on the lookout for great snacks that I can grab and throw in a bag.  Reading the description on these I was pretty sure that I was going to love them.  I was very dissapointed.  The bar itself is extremely dense and the peanut flavor is overwhelming.  It says there are plump raisins but I could barely find any.  I gave it two starts becasue of the protein level and low amount of sugar.  There is a blurb on the package about the story creation of these bars from the founder, who says that she created these with her daughter.  I can't see kids eating these bars at all. These bars are for you if you like dense granola bars with a strong peanut taste.
4591	5	This is, quite simply, the best mint dark chocolate I have ever tasted.  It's not over-poweringly minty, which I appreciate.  Also, it's a spearminty kind of mint, not peppermint, so it's a bit softer, less of a bite.  The chocolate is fantastic, and the overall experience is smooth and REALLY creamy!  I really really love it!  I actually bought a case to just have on hand, which saved me about $.60 per bar below the price at my local grocery store, so that's a plus, too!  Even with the pre-purchase.  You won't be disappointed!
4592	3	When I ordered these I was really hoping for some seriously tasty pepperoni sticks after reading reviews claiming that these were  packed with big flavor.   Pepperoni they are not.  If you are expecting seriously spicy and rich pepperoni you will be let down as I was.  Does that make these treats bad?  No, I still found them to be good in their own right.  They're like Slim Jim's that actually taste like you're eating meat as opposed to extruded grease logs.  They're pretty good and I may buy them again but be warned that it's just not quite pepperoni.<br /><br />On a side note, I received a sample of their 3 day cold smoked  Old Smokies  and those things are God in meat form, I highly recommend those.
4593	5	This extra large size of Frosted Mini Wheats is an economical, tasty way to get a whole bunch of fiber into your diet.  Mini Wheats are a great deal like Triscuit crackers, only the biscuits are sweet instead of salty.  The cereal appears to be some kind of extruded wheat threads stuck together into a tiny pillow and baked.  That sounds horrible, but these are among the tastiest of breakfast cereals.<br /><br />One gotcha is that they become soggy in milk in a very short time, but it's an easy matter to eat the cereal dry with milk on the side.  Dunk if you wish.<br /><br />That's about all I can think of to recommend a breakfast cereal that you have probably eaten since you were a child.  Back then, you ate Mini-Wheats because they tasted good, and now you eat them because they are good for you. Pity that there isn't a little plastic toy in the package.  :-)
4594	4	Drinkable, pleasant, flavorful. I will probably try some others to see if they are a little spicier, but would be happy with this if not. I do like that this one already has the milk/creamer in the k cup- great for mornings. Must not be too bad, I'm drinking 2-3/day :-)
4595	5	My dogs eat this product every day, and I rather other the pack of three because I have 4 dogs.  Thanks again Amazon.
4596	5	Tried a couple of other coffees from Senseo and decided the dark roast was for me. Smooth, lots of flavor and no mess to use, such as with lose grounds. Another advantage is keeping track of how many cups I drink each morning. Just trying to be Senseo (sensible) about how much I consume each morning! I'm on automatic delivery for this coffee and that makes things a whole lot easier. Thanks Amazon!
4597	5	I could not be more thrilled with this product! It works perfectly - the large ice cubes slip right out! Zero order like some other product reportedly had! Because the ice cubes are very large they last a long time.<br /><br />These large ice cubes are so awesome that refrigerator designers will have to redesign so their refrigerators can make these!
4598	4	One reviewer said that this is not like the Saag Paneer you get at Indian restaurants.  I agree....I tend not to prefer Saag Paneer in restaurants, but I do enjoy this meal.  It's milder and has less intensity (don't know if it's less oil or less spiciness), so it's easier on my stomach.  Another reviewer said that this is their 2-year-old's favorite meal.  That indicates that it's not as strong as what you get in the restaurants, yet it's delicious.<br /><br />The  paneer  is a kind of mild cheese that tastes a little like ricotta with the texture of firm tofu.  It is an excellent vegetarian option to meat.
4599	5	This and Blue Diamond Nut Thins are my 2 favorite rice chips, both having good flavor alone or with cheese or dip.  These are cheaper through Amazon in bulk than what I can get locally, but Blue Diamond is cheaper locally, even singly.
4600	5	When we couldn't find these in our local grocery store anymore, we were very glad to find them available through Amazon. these are light and delicious and a true treat!
4601	5	I have tried many green and jasmine teas. This is my favorite - especially for the price. Since they are packed in individual foil packs buying in bulk is great.
4602	2	I can barely eat one of these without risk of breaking a tooth.<br />I think they have been sitting around too long.<br />I was expecting crunchy. I received rocks.
4603	2	I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as  coffee tasting  or with  roasted flavors,  but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this  roasted  flavor.
4604	5	I had sampled and liked this flavor K-cup coffee but was unable to find it at any store or website. Was happy to discover it on Amazon during a special sale.
4605	4	Four and One-Half Stars<br /><br />This coffee's packaging is a send-up of Jamaican style down to its name:  Marley Coffee.  (By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).  Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!  So, I thought the kick and richness was very nice and just right for me.<br /><br />As others have commented, if you're into that deep & dark, caffeine laden French roast, this may not be the coffee for you.
4606	5	This stuff is AMAZING!!!! Best thing ever! It tastes great and is very low calories and fat! I will continue to buy this stuff.
4607	5	This is a unique soda pop, I'm not quite sure I've had one like it before.  For the record I've never been to anywhere in Latin America, just the States and Canada.  Anyway, it is very much worth trying at least once.  Some people describe the flavor in reviews as like bubble gum, I'd say that close but there's something else there too.  For something as  simple  as soda pop the flavor is very subtle.  It is VERY sweet though, not sure if my bottle uses sugar or corn syrup (the ingrediants on the bottle I got says either High Frutose Corn Syrup or Sucrose was used) but regardless, it is very sweet, probably up to the level of Jolt way back when they still used cane sugar if not more.  It's not something I'd want every day, I'd grow tired of it, but that is probably true of almost anything.  But it is a nice unique treat to try, and despite the price and shipping (It was packed very well as an aside, and shipped quickly so I don't think the shipping was overpriced considering that) I know I'll order it again when the mood hits to have this.
4608	5	Now Grain Free Turkey and Duck Formula dog food is great.  My shelties love it and I love that it has no junk in the formula.  It is healthy for my pets.  I receive my orders in a timely fashion and usually sooner than expected.  Amazon is great in getting the orders out.
4609	5	Like I said good to the last drop and just 'bold' eoungh to shake out the cobwebs in the am. And now they say a couple of cups are good for the heart. Sortda like dark beer. Anyway it was another excellent Amazon transaction.
4610	3	I had bought these nutmegs for a friend who said it was hard for her to find whole nutmegs. She did thank me for them but even though I asked her for some feedback to share with Amazon customers I am afraid she did not oblige.
4611	5	I have used several energy/recovery/hydration drinks in the past (Gatorade, Heed, etc.), and Cytomax seems to provide the best solution for me.  I play soccer regularly and am older (in my 50's).  Since moving to Phoenix I have found that I am pretty much nutrient starved and dehydrated by the end of play and suffer from lactic acid build up.  The night I play and the next day take their toll on me.  I've found that these effects are greatly reduced if I drink Cytomax during and shortly after play.  For post recovery I usually take in 30 to 40 grams of protein (muscle milk or protein powders) and find this definitely reduces post-exercise  pain.   I believe in this product. It also keeps my energy level up as I play.<br /><br />However, I recently purchased Cytomax from Direct Supercenter.  I made the purchase on May 2.  On May 9, I received a note from Amazon that no shipment had yet been made.  I contacted the seller through Amazon asking about shipment and an expected delivery date, only to get a request asking about my experience in purchasing the product.  Okay ... two-and-a-half  weeks later, still no word from the seller about shipping, so I finally cancelled the order (May 18). This is a common product.  I am greatly dissatisfied with the seller and will no longer conduct business with them.  As for Cytomax, I think it's a great product.
4612	3	I am such a fan of Dimitri's Classic and Extra Horseradish recipes (they are TREMENDOUS!)so I ordered the Chipolte/Habanero hoping for a smokey pepper version of the same stuff.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed.  This stuff is SO hot that it totally overpowers all of the other flavors.....you might as well just squirt hot sauce into tomato juice, it would be a lot cheaper and the tast would be about the same.<br /><br />I like hot stuff, but not when the heat is all you can taste.  Perhaps some folks like this blend. Not me.
4613	5	Item was received as promised. The coffee was very good, the only thing that I would like is a K-cud that would give a 16oz cup.
4614	5	Item came in perfect condition and on time. Easy make instructions and very large quantity. College student that is looking forward for easy meals in near future.
4615	5	I love these!  They are the perfect healthy snack that's easy to grab on the go!  They taste like eating a fruity treat!
4616	5	I found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my  go-to  coffees for my Keurig.  Not too strong or bitter, I rather enjoy the flavor.  Sadly with the recent  K-cup coup  staged by Green Mountain Coffees, it looks like Amazon isn't carrying the Wolfgang Puck coffees any longer and my Subscribe and Save (and my business) will need to go elsewhere.  Definitely give this coffee a shot if you can.
4617	5	my daughterinlaw likes me even better than my son today because of this fabulous funkychunky popcorn.  if you have somebody you need to bribe or influence, this might be your answer.
4618	5	Ginger relieves the nausea and morning stiffness of arthritis as well as relieving exercise pain. This ginger is hot, sweet and spicy.  It is thinly sliced, soft and chewy and lightly coated with sugar crystals. It is delicious and I enjoy it as a snack/desert.
4619	5	Coconut Oil is so tasty, it goes great with anything sweet. I use it on a piece of bread with honey, so good. It is also good for Asian style sweet dishes, gives an excellent flavor. If you using it as a dietary supplement by taking a tablespoon; it can be quite difficulty to swallow because of the texture. One thing about this oil is it doesn't refrigerate well and at 76 Fahrenheit it melts completely.
4620	5	Title says it all.  After reading an article regarding how virtually all of the honey bought in grocery and big box stores has all of the honey filtered out (short of the organic, etc), we decided to expand our horizons and are glad we did.<br /><br />This honey is wonderful.  It's darker than our store bought counterpart and really has a more complex flavor profile also.  My parents were up recently and we had this out to finish off our pizza crust with and they couldn't stop raving about it either.  Guess I just gave this company a new customer.
4621	4	I don't like instant mashed potatoes, but when I came down with a very bad cold/flu and the power went out in Southern California, I was forced to eat Instant Mashed Potatoes and these weren't bad tasting at all they were pretty good. So I decided to keep them on hand for emergencies and for lazy days.<br /><br />I still love homemade mashed potatoes. But these are good to have as a standby.
4622	5	This mix makes the best scones I have ever eaten!  They are so easy to make.  You just add cream and bake.  Wonderful!
4623	5	You won't miss the gluten in this mix...in fact, your non-gluten-free friends will love this as much or more than their favorite brownie recipe.  These bake up moist and rich, with none of those chemical ingredients you will find in other commercial brownie mixes.  YUM!!
4624	3	I recently ordered some of Meiji's limited-edition chocolate bars online and it occurred to me that perhaps Amazon carried them for less (they don't, at all). My quest led me to this product which not only looked interesting but had garnered reviewer raves as well. Today's errands took me past a Japanese grocery, so I made it a point to have a look for it (it's apparently a popular impulse purchase because it was displayed next to the cash register).<br />Given the positive reviews, I had high hopes. And if appearance is high on your list of priorities, then this is definitely your kind of snack because one thing the Japanese have nailed, in spades, is a visual aesthetic and these things are adorable, plus mine came packaged in a really snappy cardboard tube. However, while good looks are the top priority when it comes to boyfriends, my criteria for food are much less shallow and Apollo falls short of the mark.<br />I think the basis of the problem is that the Japanese, who produce a number of slammin' items (remember that aesthetic), have so far proved themselves incapable of mastering chocolate. I have yet to sample Japanese chocolate that isn't both waxy and short on the essence of chocolate flavor. This item is no exception, plus I don't find the strawberry flavor all that vivid (although to Meiji's credit, it's natural). And it really is easy to finish the container, but I believe that's due more to the fact that Apollo is sweet and innocuous, not that it's delicious. Perhaps if cocoa butter rather than vegetable oil had been the second ingredient listed, Apollo would suggest chocolate rather than paraffin, but who can say for sure? What is sure is that I won't be buying it again.<br />The bottom line: empty calories can be had more deliciously; save your quota for a more worthy goodie. I have no doubt that this review will earn me slams from fan boys (in addition to those guaranteed to turn up immediately, courtesy of obsessive liver-lipped Finnish ugly-boy troll stalkers), but I have to call 'em as I see 'em. 3.5 stars would be about right, but we can't assign by halves so 3 it is.
4625	5	I've been trying unsuccessfully to find this flavor.  I've bought out all the A&W cream sode jellies in the Target and Cub Foods stores in my surrounding metropolitan areas.  They never replenished this flavor.  So, I just thought I'd try googling them - was I excited to find amazon carries them - I'll be ordering shortly!!!!!!!!!!
4626	5	Yep!  It's true!  Not one complaint from any of my picky eaters.  Tasty, easy to make, and shipped well.  Great addition to the pantry!
4627	5	I've used this for years and it's the best I've found.  I have a seriously black thumb but with Schultz Plant Food, I can actually get things to grow.  I have no problem with over fertilizing or under fertilizing, it works for young plants, old plants, indoor or outdoor plants, flowers or edibles, you can even use it in your Topsy-Turvy.<br /><br />It's concentrated and easy to use(this bottle lasts a LONG time).  I usually mix up a half gallon and water my plants as needed.<br /><br />Best of all, it's safe so if someone (human or pet) accidentally gets a taste of it, there's none of that rushing off the to the ER.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />**Note** Not suitable for Air Ferns
4628	5	I looked long and hard for a good  natural  product with no grains or crap in it and the Zuke's were the best I've found that were not incredibly expensive. The small size is perfect for obedience training with my dog and none of the flavors I've found leave any mess in my pockets. Treats do not have to be large or impressive to be effective. The smaller the better, I say. My dog and I both really like these.
4629	5	I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!
4630	5	I've tried several of the Larabar Bars because they were recommended by a nutritionalist and personal trainer. The lesser ingredients with minimal processing, the healthier they are.  These fit the bill and they taste wonderful; slightly spicey chocolate!  Great flavor
4631	5	If you like dark, bold coffee flavor, then Starbucks French Roast is definitely one you should try. I got two of these 40oz bag less than a month ago for $18.99/each with prime's free shipping. That was a great deal. Unfortunately, it looks like the price has shot up by quite a bit, so I won't be buying it through Amazon dealers anymore unless things change again. But, if this is the best price you can find, you'll be thrilled with the product.
4632	5	This is wonderful on scones!  Serve with a hot cup of black tea!  Spicy and smooth!
4633	5	As a Florida native, I grew up eating mangoes and love them dearly.  I just tasted this tart and it is wonderful to eat and a nice sight to see.  It is light and creamy, with a delicious mango flavor that lingers in the mouth.  The crust is perfect and it holds up well when sliced.  Although I was told this could last in the freezer for up to a year, I doubt that any thinking person could keep it in the freezer for that long.  It sings out to be savored now.
4634	4	I prefer coffee that is a little bolder, but if you like smooth, mild coffee, this is a good choice.  The flavor is mild, but with some subtle accents.<br /><br />I tried making this coffee first in the type of single pod machine that it is designed for, but found it way too weak for my tastes.  Next I put several of the pouches (6) into a regular machine, with three cups were of water.  Even in like this it was too weak for my taste, but you can tell that it is good coffee.  It is smooth and delicious.<br /><br />The packaging is nice, but I found the little packs to be hard to open.  I couldn't get any of them open with my fingers, instead having to use scissors.
4635	4	This shampoo met my expectations.  I have very thick hair, and this shampoo leaves your hair fairly soft and smooth.  It also smells very pleasant.<br /><br />I use Head & Shoulders regularly, but I tried this product as an alternative.  So far, it is very good - I still notice very minor flakes, but overall it has done a good job of keeping dandruff to a minimum.<br /><br />I would consider purchasing this product again, I really like it.
4636	5	...a little expensive,and somewhat runny in texture, but yummy. Prefer the one made by the Swiss company, the name escapes me, but could not find that at Amazon. Arrived promptly from the seller.
4637	5	Tasted these bars in a health food store and grabbed several flavors ot Kind bars to try.  The chocolate cherry cashew ones are like crack -- totally addicting!  Amazing blend of tastes makes me feel like I'm sneaking a candy bar instead of a healthy, wholesome friut and nut bar.  These are soft and chewy with with wonderful nuts throughout.  Major indulgence and healthy snack in one.  FAB product!
4638	5	My dog has been using Check-ups and Greenies for a while and he loves this new addition to his dental chewies routine. The medium size is perfect for my 25 lb. cocker spaniel. The bone is roughly the size of a large chicken drumstick bone. When I was opening the bag, my dog followed me around. I suspected he knew this bag of bones was for him. He grabbed the chew bone immediately after I offered it to him found a nice corner and went about his chewing. It lasted a good minute or two. This stuff is made of quinoa, gluten free, and touts anti-oxidant benefits. And I assume it tastes good because it actually smells pretty good. 5 stars for Zoe Anti-Oxidant Chew Bones and I would buy again and recommend to others. When my dog is happy... I'm happy.
4639	5	I was introduced to Throat Coat tea several years ago by a friend. I've never been without it since. I'm lucky enough that I don't get many colds or sore throats, but when I do, I crave this tea. I should work for these people because I've sold tons of it to friends by giving them a cup when they're not feeling well.<br /><br />When you have a cold or sore throat, nothing feels better than this fabulous tea. It's very aptly named. I think it feels like my throat has been covered in velvet. You can definitely feel the 'coating' after just a few sips. When I get sick, I'll ususally drink about 3 cups per day. The soothing effects last quite a while and it's heaven when you're trying to sleep with a nasty cold. I've had friends who sing that swear by this tea before a performance, but I don't sing outside the shower myself. :D<br /><br />Nothing else on the market works as well, especially when sweetened with a little honey.  I depend so much upon this tea that I even brought it back with me to Mexico, where I live now. It's sitting in a canister, ready. I've stored this tea for as much as a year with no problem.  Knock wood, I haven't needed it yet this year, but it's comforting to know it will be there when I need it. :D
4640	2	my german shepherd went thru this in less than 20 mins. I was very disappointed. Everlasting must be a good tasting treat, or perhaps a smaller dog could make it last longer? who knows for sure.  So, although I personally didn't taste this, my german shepherd plowed thru in record time.
4641	5	I like Taste of Crete cookies. There are three kinds: orange, grape, and regular. All three are made with olive oil, so I suppose they are more healthful than most cookies. They do not taste like olives any more than ordinary cookies taste like corn or soybeans. Olive oil is simply the fat they were made with and is better than most.<br /><br />They are small like vanilla wafers but kind of hard, like pfeffernuesse. You wouldn't just put them in a disk of ice cream: you can't break them with a spoon. If someone stabs them, they might shoot out of the dish. But they are chewy and fun and might be served as finger food with tea, coffee, or cheese.<br /><br />The plain variety have a mild nuttiness from sesame. The orange ones have a delicate fragrance, are not orangey or acidic, and are good with tea. The grape ones are my favorite and taste like raisins rather than grapes. The grape syrup has oxidized in baking and makes them brown. Their dark flavor reminds me of ginger snaps.<br /><br />They stay fresh for more than a week after opening the container. I keep a box in my office and nibble a few when I must miss a meal. Three cookies have 130 calories, slightly less than a slice of bread with a pat of butter.
4642	5	I have a finicky Brussels Griffon. After spending $$$ on 30 pound bag on another brand, which she hated, I finally purchased samples of dog foods and put them in bowls to see which one she would eat. Well the house looked like a dog food commercial with my little girl sniffing at each one, as there were about 7 different kinds. This one was the clear winner. She loves it and she looks great. She has a beautiful coat,  and tons of stamina and energy.  Great stuff.
4643	4	I am a big fan of these bars. The flavor is great and they are a fantastic alternative to those processed protein bars.  The only negative is that this product is made in China where the manufacturing standards are shady and as far as I am concerned, shouldn't be trusted. Too bad because this  is a good product and I would have continued buying them otherwise.
4644	5	I absolutely love Pop Chips.  They give me the crunch and flavor that I want and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat them!  Perfect portion size in the single serve bag.  I have tried 3 of the flavors (original, BBQ, and green onion) and the BBQ is the best yet.
4645	5	This was a gift for my Father's birthday.  He loves that the Keurig machine can sit right on top of it.  No problems, exactly as described. Very fast shipping!
4646	3	I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the  organ  meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!
4647	5	I am so happy to see someone making snacks without high fructose corn syrup!  It is hard to find quick snacks for my son.  Corn syrup is in practically everything now days and I appreciate someone making the effort to make something that tastes good and pleases the kids as well as mom.  Best of all - my son loves them!
4648	4	My daughter's 1 year old blue nose pit, Dex, loves these Everlasting Treats. But I wish they would last longer. We put the treat insides the everlast ball and within eight hours, it's done. Maybe it's because he does not touch any of his other chews when he has these everlast treats.
4649	5	After several previous orders of McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal that arrived with dented cans, I am happy to tell you that the packaging has improved and all the cans arrived in perfect condition. Great product! Great packaging!
4650	5	I ordered one for my daughter & one for my mother-in-law.  Both of them really liked it.
4651	5	these taste amazing. might make the poops burn a little :o but they taste amazing. the salt and vinegar ones are the best and very addicting.
4652	5	Tried a couple of different brand name formulas and our son takes this one the best.<br />As far as people complaining baout packaging, get a grip of yourselves.  It's an extra measure to keep the food fresher, AND, if you read the box, you can actually dump the powder out of the bag into the tub, as long as you wash the tub prior to doing so.  If you are really that annoyed with the packaging, then washing 1 extra tub (provided you wash all your baby bottles after each feeding) once a week is NOT a big deal.  Get over it and stop lowering star average for this.  Bottom line, the formula itself is outstanding.
4653	5	I'm kind of a popcorn fiend (I routinely walk into theaters just to buy popcorn and walk out without bothering to see a movie), but I hate-hate-HATE microwavable popcorn.  My wife bought me the Great Northern Little Bambino tabletop popcorn machine for Christmas, and I ordered the 24-pack of Great Northern popcorn packs because they were compatible with the machine and had consistently good reviews.<br /><br />We decided to take the popcorn machine for a test run during our NYE party, and the popcorn was, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever had.  It was just the right combination of salty, buttery and fresh, and it was a cinch to make.  Everyone at the party loved the stuff (we went through half the box), and I find myself craving some now as I write this review...<br /><br />In short, I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend this popcorn.
4654	5	I used these years ago when I was dieting because I like a lot of butter on my veggies!  I couldn't find them when I wanted to watch my calories again, so I checked Amazon and sure enough, there they were.  Still as good as ever!  I wish they'd sell them in smaller quantities, but that's a minor problem. I probably have enough to last a year now! The product is great and while they aren't as good as a stick of butter, (is anything!!??) they give a nice kick to plain vegetables and keep them moist in the mouth. They also give a nice sheen and flavor to oven baked rolls without all the calories.
4655	3	My dog seemed to like these, but not as much as other snacks he's been given.  And, I definitely didn't enjoy smelling the gas which was emitted after he ate these.
4656	5	I've been buying this line of products for years.  We have pugs and they don't do well with large hard treats.  These are perfect.  They are soft and very small so it's not an issue giving multiple  cookies  as they are low in calories.  And of course the dogs love them.
4657	5	Wow, this is good soup!  At first sip, it reminded me of Campbells, but it's not quite as sweet, is more tomato-ey, and is richer because of the butter.  It's addictive, especially because it's so quick to serve (no struggling to dissolve milk or water into it).  I can polish off a whole can just as a snack.  I've also mixed in brown rice or whole wheat pasta for a healthy feast.  Great stuff!!
4658	5	Great natural breakfast, had problems for years with irregularity, but after trying this I am now cured and wouldn't eat anything else.
4659	3	If you like ginger, then this a delicious drink costing roughly 3 drinks for a buck. There is no nutritional information on the package, at least the sample pack that I received through the Vine program. Multiple studies have proven the effectiveness of ginger for treatment of nausea. Other reported benefits of ginger include effect on inflammation, variety of gastrointestinal symptoms like stomach cramps, allergies, and lowering cholesterol.
4660	4	The pasta is fine, tastes very good and the package is plenty for 5-6 people.  The problems I have are A) one of the bags arrived with a tear and some of the pasta was spilled inside the box and B) package says cooks in 3 minutes but that is NOT true. It takes about 10 minutes unless you like your pasta REALLY firm. The quick cooking was a major part of the reason I made this purchase so that, combined with the torn bag are the reasons I won't purchase again.
4661	1	These beverage coasters are made out of some strange material that simply does not hold up.  I would think that the first, if not the only requirement for a coaster would be that it has to be waterproof.  Cold beverages  sweat,  and the main reason to even use a coaster in the first place is to protect the surface beneath them.  These become waterlogged almost immediately, and quickly start to crumble and disintegrate into a sticky goo.  Even when new and perfectly dry, they are extremely brittle, with small pieces breaking off almost immediately, and unless great care is taken, tend to crack and shatter in normal use.<br /><br />I did notice that when I failed to clean one of these up fast enough, the dog ate it, which was worrisome, but he did not suffer any ill effects.  So at least these coasters are non-toxic, and certainly biodegradeable.  However, they utterly fail to perform their intended purpose.  I would give this product zero stars if I could.
4662	5	Beets!!!  How many of you out there have babies/toddlers/kids who eat beets?  Well, mine aren't big fans but they LOVE these pouches.  This is a great combination with the blueberries and bananas and you can still taste the beets.  Anytime my 15 month-old twin boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their antioxidants and nutrients.<br /><br />It's especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage.  For the teethers, it's helpful to place a few pouches in the fridge.  For the picky eaters, it's helpful for us to administer a swig of this inbetween bites.  These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy.  If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food.  The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all.  Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later or if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack.  No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.
4663	4	I love cheese and broccoli, so I was looking forward to trying this. The cheese was all right, like similar Velveeta products I had in the past, but the broccoli was so little that I supposed is for the garnish only. The pasta shells are so small that for a moment I thought it was rice. It looks like it. It took less than half an hour to be ready, and it tasted good enough, to be served as a quick dinner in a day one gets home late. I will buy it if I see it on sale.
4664	5	I love these and it is the best treat.  I love cookies and couldn't find one that was very good until I found these.  I can eat a whole bag in one day!  Matter of fact, I need to order another case.
4665	5	What could be better for snacking? These are a treat to have, excellent for gift giving, or giving to yourself. Everyone loves them. They should be packaged better for shipping. They come loosely packed, they need to be shrink wrapped so the little covered almonds don't break.
4666	5	It was so fun to have Margaritas again.  They are a tad more tart than I would prefer, but overall very satisfying.
4667	5	Not too sweet/fat/creamy, with perfect portion size.  Traditional 3 in 1 mixes tend to be oversweetened with too much mix; this mix is great.  There are more packets for the same volume (due to smaller portion sizes).  Perfect for those of us who don't want super sludgy thick coffee; and the smaller portion sizes are still great for large mugs.  Add a 2nd pack to the mug if you want a stronger mix.
4668	5	The peach flavored tea is one of my family's favorites. The peach taste is just right--not too strong or syrupy tasting. There is also no chemical taste as sometimes happens with artificially sweetened drinks.<br /><br />This is really easy to make. I just pour two packs into a large pitcher, stir, and keep it in my refrigerator so I always have a nice cold drink. It is very refreshing.<br /><br />Shop for price. On sale at my local supermarket I can buy 4 packs for six dollars.
4669	5	My baby girl loves this little puff.  She's very attachy and she gets scared when I walk just a few feet away from her but if she has this on her hand she does not care if I am standing far from her.  She always finish her puffs before she goes back to whatever she's doing or watch.  This is even a great snack for adult, my sister and I both love this fruit puff.  The banana flavor is my favorite.<br /><br />BTW, where's the free prime shipping Amazon?
4670	5	Great extra bold cup of coffee! I make it on the largest setting into my travel mug with a bit of sugar and hazelnut creamer and it is wonderful! My husband prefers to stick to the Donut Shop coffee, he says this one is too strong, but if you like bold coffee you will love this one!I will for sure be drinking this throughout the winter, then I will switch back to Donut Shop when the weather turns warm again. Dark Magic is even better than Santa's Buzz.
4671	5	I ordered this for my brother for Christmas.  I have not had a lot of smoked salmon, but he loves it, so I was going in w/ little experience.<br /><br />The first associate I spoke with very graciously explained the differences between wet and dry smoked salmon---all news to me---and how his product was prepared and packaged.  I ordered it and yes, it was a huge hit with my brother.  He said it was excellent.<br /><br />In the meantime, I had mistakenly placed a second order in ordering other things from Amazon.  My fault.  I notified Amazon, and notified Alaska Smokehouse, and was immediately sent confirmation that the second order had been deleted.  However, I did receive the second oder of smoked salmon, although it never showed up on my credit card statement.<br /><br />I called Alaska Smokehouse to ask how to return the second order and they graciously said to keep the salmon, and please enjoy it as a thank you for being a customer.<br /><br />The same brother had a birthday in January, so I sent the second order to him along w/ the story and he was impressed and delighted. He said at Christmas he had to share, but this time around his salmon was a  protected species !<br /><br />Great product, great service....what more could one ask for????
4672	5	Enjoyable all times of the day. Just the right amount of salt and flavor. This is becoming a favorite in my house. I also take it to work to satisfy that afternoon craving.
4673	4	I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth's Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon.  Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however  Plum   Ella's Kitchen  and  Happy Baby  brands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other brands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we weren't paying for water in those packages.
4674	5	Excellent!  Is it a cereal or is it a snack?  I use it as a snack!  I toss some on my yogurt and it makes me feel like I am having a small light dessert!  Just enough chocolate so you know it's there!  Crunchy!<br />I love it and will definitely buy it again!  I am looking forward to trying the Cherry Vanilla next!
4675	5	We have four very large German shepherds that eat a mixture of a raw diet and Blue Buffalo and they seem to really like this food! I was really thrilled to see amazon carrying this so I stock up on all the Blue Buffalo canned food every few weeks and have really loved just having it shipped to my front door! We go through quite a bit of this canned food when they aren't eating raw and after trying several different natural brands we have stuck with Blue because they seem to digest it very well! Yard cleanup is as easy as it can be with 4 dogs with this food and that makes me a satisfied dog mom!
4676	5	Finally a bag of popcorn where all the ingredients are natural and there isn't all those chemicals in the bag.  There is no reason for them to be there!!!  I have tasted all three flavors and WANT MORE!!!  They are all delicious and adding the flavoring AFTER popping is no big deal.  I can't wait for Amazon to get this in so I can get more!
4677	4	I thought that because of the name attached that I would be wow-ed...its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular.
4678	4	I have not used this product yet, but with Dr. Oz's recommendation I am sure this is a very good product.
4679	1	I was so disappointed!  I received the cups and tried one right away.  It was like hot water.  The cups felt empty so I opened one to see.  The  cider  had melted or something, causing the cups to be empty.  I thought maybe one or two could be bad, but it was the whole box!  Soooo disappointed!
4680	5	Love love love this candy.  When I was a kid it was call  MacIntosh  and only came from England.  So glad to find it here and be able to share with my children.
4681	5	I've been using Fromm Surf N Turf in my rotation (which has come down to this and the beef frittata veg by Fromm) over the last several months.<br />First, I have an itchy/scratchy bichon.  Surpringly she does not have food allergies, but environmental allergies.  She gets better and worse, depending on the season.  Her coat is nice, skin, stool, all good.<br /><br />Next I have a sensitive tummy Portuguese Water dog who cannot have any grain AT ALL.  Surf N Turf is perfect and she digests it well.  I've tried several other foods and she just cannot handle foods with grain in it, not even the 'easy to digest' rice formulas.<br /><br />Even my little chihuahua, Cookie, does great on it.  Beautiful, soft and full coat, nice teeth, breath, stool and overall health.<br /><br />I do feed this as 70% of their overall diet, the other 30% being from The Honest Kitchen (Zeal and Love formulas).<br /><br />This is a food I've happily recommended!  And I don't see myself feeding anything else. Pleased with the customer service as well!
4682	2	I purchased this locally and it's awful. I normally use Americolor brand airbrush colors, however I was in need of black and couldn't wait for shipping. This color is really not black at all. Understand, I'm well aware that black food dyes are derived from multiple hues being blended, but the color I mixed myself was more black than this. It truly is a dark, dark hunter green shade. Very disappointing.  Their white is also bad. I shook the contents as directed (like crazy)and the pigments never combined. I got a watery puddle with some white spots. I love KopyKake for their projector, but I'll stick to Americolor or Chefmaster for my airbrush colors.
4683	4	I tasted both  The Switch  Orange Tangerine and this drink, the Watermelon Strawberry. Between the two, Watermelon Strawberry is the winner. The taste of both the watermelon and the strawberry came through and tasted nice. The aroma is also good and smells somewhat like the fresh fruit. The overall effect is like a Hansens or other fruit soda, but with half the carbonization (bubbles).<br /><br />On the other hand, I would have liked a larger serving size (12oz vs 8.3oz) and although the flavors were good, I think it would have been nicer if they were just a bit more lush.<br /><br />This is something I might opt for in the future.
4684	5	It would be very hard to purchase any other brand of split peas after having had the pleasure of tasting these. Each pea is perfect; no imperfect ones to toss out. The final result is mouthwatering. I made a big pot, threw in some vegetables, and can barely keep myself away from having too much now and not enough left for another day.<br /><br />And, being organic and GMO free, wrapped very carefully in gunny sack material inside a plastic bag, it is a healthful contributory to the diner, not a questionable one.<br /><br />I'm really glad I discovered these split peas. I can't imagine anything better.
4685	1	I didn't really have very high expectations when buying this item but was disappointed nonetheless. The food is only going o be edible in a survival scenario. From what I have seen you will not want to eat it any other time. Expect to be turned off when you try it for the first time.
4686	1	Bottom line, these taste like cheap hotel coffee. Your least favorite Nespresso capsule variety is 100X better tasting than these capsules. Taste is what matters, ECC capsules are awful.<br /><br />This goes for Cremoso, Indiad'oro, Espressivo - unfortunately, I bought all three types. Hardly a difference between them, but I listed them in awful to undrinkable order.<br /><br />However, if that's not enough of a reason to avoid, consider these;<br /><br />-they're difficult to insert in Nespresso machines<br />-they're difficult to remove from Nespresso machines<br />-they frequently blister during brewing, thus  brewing  coffee from the side of the capsules<br />-they are stale right out of the package (though the expiration date reads otherwise)<br />-all ten per box are not quite vacuum-sealed in plastic, hence opening the plastic hastens further spoilage<br />-they are only a dime less than real Nespresso capsules!!!<br /><br />I actually threw away unused capsules, they were that bad. They are not worth free. Quite weak for a company started by a former Nespresso executive. Perhaps they have a serious quality control issue in the U.S.?
4687	3	After eating 5 1/2 of the 8 packs, my little guy developed an allergy to peas!  Nothing major, but ever time he eats peas now his face breaks out in a rash.  I thought children were allergic or not, but this isn't the case...
4688	5	I bought this product for my son who is in grad school. He said Emeril's K-cups were the best tasting ones he has tried so far. I will definitely buy them for him again.
4689	4	This granola is great!!! A fine blend of crunchiness and fruit, being gluten free is also a plus. Please come out with more flavors!
4690	3	I was very happy to find holistic cat food on Amazon that was eligible for the prime membership free shipping.  I tried both the dry and canned food since my cats eat both.  Unfortunately my cats do not like this food - only one will eat the canned food and this same cat will not eat the dry, and oddly enough, vice versa.  The other cat will eat the dry but not the canned.  I have also noticed that their coats are not as silky as they were with another brand, which I will be going back to. I am giving it 3 stars as it is a good holistic food and conveniently available, just is not something my cats like.
4691	5	I really like another chocolate flavored bar that's also gluten free, and have been a repeat customer of the other bar.  But I was very surprised at how much more I like the LaraBar Jocalat, Chocolate bar.  These area great!  I rated the other product 5 stars, because I simply couldn't find anything wrong with them and thought they were that good - these are even better.  And they're gluten free!<br /><br />One slight caution: I knew I wouldn't be able to eat a regular meal one day, so I took three of these along and made the mistake of enjoying all three at once in place of the meal.  I hadn't thought about what the  consequences  might be.  Two of these bars at a time are plenty for an active lower digestive system!  If you intend to spend an hour or more in a meeting a few hours after eating three of these, you may find it more than a little uncomfortable.  Have some Imodium handy in that instance.  ;~}<br /><br />GRITS
4692	5	This was a great deal... I can drink Starbucks everyday and it's a very convenient dispenser too. I am glad I saw the deal on a friends coupon page
4693	5	I mainly use pearled barley in soups and stews.  It adds a chewy wholesomeness, extra fiber and healthy amounts of niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese and selenium.  I just add 1/2 to 1 cup of barley to the boiling stock as I cook.  It also makes a great side dish when seasoned and served as you would wild rice.<br /><br />Arrowhead Mills pearled barley is a great value - I love that it comes in 6 28-oz bags. It works out to $1.57 per pound, and even less if you sign up for Subscribe & Save.  I keep one bag in a kitchen canister for daily use, and store the others in a ziplock bag in my pantry (to protect against moisture and insects).
4694	1	This is an excellent coffee but unlike Amazon's usual great service whoever they use to fulfill the coffee orders is terrible.  I ordered several boxes of this coffee from Amazon but they were shipped to me just thrown in a box.  Anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of the cups were damaged and unusable.  Worse yet Amazon won't take a return since it is a food item.<br /><br />In summary, buy this coffee, just not from Amazon.
4695	5	The price was excellent and the tea arrived quickly.  This is where I will be buying my tea in the future.
4696	5	The product arrived on time and fresh and this was the only place that I have found this tasty snack.  I would buy them again.
4697	1	worst coconut water ever, period.<br /><br />I saw them in my local BJs and thought of trying it, the taste was horrible, had an artificial flavor to it which remains in ur breath for some time. I thought of trying after my 6 mile run, and even then I couldnt drink it. had to return it and then bought some good coconut water from a local asian store (realcocowater) and it tastes much better and doesnt have any artificial flavor like this.<br />I would not even give it a one star if possible.<br />Dont buy this, its a waste of money
4698	5	Thank u I will buy again it was for my ladys nite and everone loved it I order it on a Monday an it can the nexted day again I will b ordering this again
4699	3	Tastes great in coffee and baked goods- but the price is so high it makes a cup of coffee in the morning so costly, I might as well go to Starbucks! Am looking for something else next time.
4700	1	Label clearly says  Cranberry, JUICE COCTAIL FROM CONCENTRATE with other natual flavors ,verbatum incl. caps on, except the word Cranberry is 4 x as larger than the other wording below it.  How the heck can they claim it's not from concentrate when it's clearly worded otherwise on the front of the label!<br />I was expecting to actually get to taste natural juice for a change...boy was I wrong.  How do they get off writing their story when the label clearly states otherwise?  It's ridiculous.<br />It has a slight cran tang to it, but a far cry from tasting fresh!  In fact it tastes like it's ingredients...THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER and the second is HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP...the worst ingredient ever!<br />I AM APAULED AT THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT GOING ON HERE, SOMEONE SHOULD SUE THEM...they advertise natural juice not from concentrate while trying to sell their product, then you get water, high fructose corn syrup and a little natural juice that is from concentrate!<br />SHOOT THIS COMPANY'S ADVERTISING EXEC IN THE HEAD, he's trying to kill us with the ingredients and I am actually drinking the crud because I paid so much for it, so he's probably adding to my death.<br />I can throw it out because Amazon said they will make good and are investigating the product's advertisement...Amazon has great morals, thanks Amazon...hope you like the pics that prove I am not a crazy, irate customer.<br />27% juice, the rest water and high fructose corn syrup (worse for you than sugar)...I posted pictures.
4701	5	As far as Louisiana style sauces go, this is one of the best and cheapest. Most any<br /> local  type establishment you visit in and around New Orleans will have a bottle of<br />Crystal on the table. Its not hot at all, maybe a 3 on a 10 scale, but the flavor<br />particularly for your basic generic Cajun spread is fantastic.<br /><br />The best thing about Crystal is that its not only available at most retail outlets, but<br />its cheap. Locally this 6oz. bottle can be had for $0.69. Comparatively, the 2oz. bottle<br />of Tabasco costs $1.59 at the local grocery so it pays to have a couple of bottles of<br />Crystal laying around. Its also a beautiful stunning red color that I've learned to<br />appreciate over the years of sampling all the Louisiana style sauces. Next to Chef Paul's<br />Magic Pepper Sauce, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Good in stews, gumbos, on fish, chicken and pork when you want all the flavor without<br />the burn. If you're cooking for friends they wont mind you throwing in liberal doses<br />of this stuff. 5 Scovies<br /><br />BTW, I've been a fan of Crystal for a long time and when they introduced their new Extra<br />Hot Sauce recently I got so excited I wrote the company a letter. Well a week later I got<br />a personal note back from the president of Baumer Foods thanking me for my business, and<br />he included 2 coupons for any size Crystal Hot Sauce. These guys are doing it right!
4702	5	Love Metromint water. All the flavor without the sugar or artificial additives.Plus, no carbonation.  Great for dieters who don't want the calories but are sick of the flavor of water.  The Cherry mint ha a nice flavor with a hint of cherry.  Delicious.
4703	5	I have recently discovered LaraBars, and their whole-food sugar-free goodness. This was my first try of the Jocolat line... as has been suggested here, it's probably best to buy a single bar somewhere before buying a pack of 16 of them, and the chocolate coffee version was the only one I've found locally yet. So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br /><br />It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br /><br />In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br /><br />My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet. The regular LaraBars seem better as  food  (I eat them sometimes when I miss or am late for a meal). This seems more like  dessert .
4704	4	We have a couple of small dogs and for them the treats are to big. We break them down to smaller pieces and that's not easy because the treats are hard.  One dog likes them a lot and the other so so.  We always feed our dogs all natural foods(they love cooked vegetables) so Newman's Organics were just what we wanted.  Recommended if you have medium to large dogs.
4705	4	We've purchased basmati rice from Sam's Club and used it in our kitchen for several years.  But the last few times we went, Sam's didn't have it in stock.  It was much better than regular long grain rice off the grocery shelf, so when I found this at Amazon I ordered it right away.<br /><br />The rice we bought at Sam's was better.  This has great flavor, but it's kind of gummy, where the other was not.<br /><br />Next time I purchase, I'll probably try another brand.
4706	1	This toy is adorable, however, the day we received it both leaves fell right off the top...which to me is a chocking concern.  If you're going to make a dog toy (and ours is not a huge chewer, they simply fell off while she was carrying the carrot around in her mouth by the leaves) you should make it sturdy!  I would not suggest this dog toy.
4707	3	I really love this tea, but the original package was taken away and all bags (from 6 boxes) were put on an envelope. Very bad for storing while they last.
4708	4	I purchased these crispy crackers and will absolutely purchase more.  They are very crispy and have a very mild taste.  You can eat them with anything, from savory or sweet. I like them with soup or salad and eat them in the morning with butter and jam.  I would recommend them to anyone.  Very pleasing gluten free product.
4709	1	Barely any chocolate inside - not at all what the picture on the box shows. I had fond memories of a cereal like this (might have been a different brand, but it was just like the stuff on the box) and decided to try this one - a huge disappointment! There is almost nothing inside - half empty shells with barely a smudge of chocolate. I'm 27 but this is a let down for kids of all ages!
4710	5	I don't usually type in reviews, but have to respond to other poster who gave poor rating to merrick canned dog food. this food is phenomenol. my dog had allergy related skin issues and after a few months of eating merricks her problems have totally vanished. and the taste...she loves it and i've heard the same reviews from many other pet owners (they say the same as me). the ingredients are top notch, no by products whatsoever and my dog loves every merrick flavor i've given her, grammy's pot pie, turducken, and smothered comfort being her favorites. please don't let the one other review influence you negatively. this dog food rocks and our  best friends are worth the price.
4711	4	My Morning Mate is a mix of mate, black tea, and red rooibos. Listed under ingredients are sweet cocoa, chocolate and almond bits, pistachio nuts, macadamia nuts and coriander with warm hazelnut and cinnamon.<br /><br />Some of the reviews on the Teavana site state that they think this tastes like coffee.  It does not taste like coffee but mate has a very distinct taste.  Although the ingredient list is extensive, I think it mostly tastes nutty.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it is not my favorite mate tea-it is a little bitter to be 5 stars.
4712	1	Tartaric acid and cream of tartar are not the same thing. Cream of tartar is made from tartaric acid. It is a weak salt derived from tartaric acid, when it is half-neutralized with potassium hydroxide.<br /><br />In most home recipes that call for tartaric acid can substitute 2 tsp cream of tartar for 1tsp tartaric acid. But if you are buying tartaric acid, you are not looking for cream of tartar and the seller should not label cream of tartar as tartaric acid.
4713	5	This is one of the yummiest K-cups I've had, and my husband and I have tried a lot of them!  When sugar and milk are added, this tastes very similar to Starbucks' Caramel Macchiato.  Also good when iced.  I also like Green Mountain's Iced Vanilla K-cups, so if you like those, you will definitely like these as well.
4714	4	Wonderful sweet treat with a low  calorie  price. I was pleasantly surprised at the nice balance of caramel and chocolate flavors. The chocolate drizzle is just enough to take this from your average caramel popcorn to a more decadent treat, but not too much to overtake the caramel popcorn base. It is a relatively small package but just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth. The only slight drawback is a slightly expensive price for the amount in a package.
4715	5	This product is real. Helping in the stomach and h. pylori parasite. Buy with confidence. Since I have been using it my stomach and acid reflux has been calming down, This is my 2nd day of using it. I take 3 x daily. morning,afternoon and night
4716	2	We have been giving our 100 pound shepherd/lab/collie/husky mix Hip Action since he was a pup. Our vet believes this is realy going to help him prevent all the hip problems that shepherd's usually have. Eventhough I cannot buy it locally, I make sure to buy it on line so my boy will remain healthy and happy!
4717	5	Love the taste, first off!  I have only tried the vanilla flavor and it has been wonderful.  The idea behind me taking this protein drink is actually two-fold.  The first is to not eliminate but lower my coffee drinking addiciton (i.e. starbucks use ot be a morning ritual!) and also because it has some calories but not too many, I've been using it as a meal replacement for breakfast time.  I'm trying to lose weight, and this is helping me get closer to my goal weight.<br /><br />Since each serving is only 100 calories, you should be prepared for that you will feel hungry about an hour after you drink it.  I started taking Yohimbine Powder, <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XOUOA4 >5 Grams Yohimbine HCL 99% Bulk Powder</a> shortly after starting to drink these shakes, and if you are trying to cut back on calories, I highly recommend some kind of natural appetite suppressant, you have no idea the difference it makes, basically a life-saver for me as I'm what you would call a snacker of snacks!<br /><br />I know some other reviewers have said that stiring the mix works for them but I'm sorry if you really want to enjoy this shake, you need a blender, plain and simple.  I could sit there in my kitchen and stir for an hour and it still won't taste nearly as good compared to blending it for thirty seconds.
4718	3	I have been giving my dog this for several weeks as a treat and am not sure if she is really getting any juice or she just loves the smell. It is hard to tell if the ball is turning when she licks it or if it remains stationary. She always comes running when she sees me pull it out the pantry so I assume that she is still getting her 'treat'. I do like the size of the container, but wish that I could tell how much is remaining.
4719	5	Great balance of sweet and cinnamon flavors.  Right amount of crunch and the 2 oz bag is actually very shareable.  especially with a very hungry,fussy 5 yr old.  Great filling snack with great crunch and nutty appeal.
4720	2	When I ordered this item it was for 2 families, when received it only contained one pig.  My error or yours?
4721	5	Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets.
4722	4	Bars are extra chewy and provide the crunch and sweet flavor to curb snack urges. Gluten-free not on the box, but company says no gluten ingredients added with only a minute chance of cross-contamination.  We have not had any problems.  Our teenagers love these. Try Chococonut bars too as this another favorite. Hope they reconsider adding GF logo.
4723	5	For anyone who is trying to get into shape; for runners, swimmers, bikers; for anyone who decided to run a 5k, 10k or train for any event, Cytomax Perfomance is the sports drink you want to have.  Unlike others, the nice thing about this drink is that it helps to flush the lactic acid from your muscles -- the stuff that makes you muscles ache after working out and the stuff that makes your muscles give out while you are working out.  The different drinks tasts good and because you mix them yourself you can make it as strong or weak as you like.  Try this product.  You will not be disappointed.<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SOVTKI >CytoSport Cytomax Performance Drink, Natural, Cranberry Grapefruit 4.5 lb (2.04 kg)</a>CytoSport Cytomax Performance Drink, Tangy Orange 24 oz (680 g)
4724	4	Caf&eacute; D'Vita began as a stand-in for theSugar-Free International Coffees that seem to have been scaled back as far as availability is concerned. It will most likely replace the International Coffee. It tastes more like coffee with the desert-like flavor of Cappuccino. I like to mix French Vanilla and Mocha flavors, and since Caf&eacute; D'Vita has both, I'm a happy camper...with one exception. Too expensive! However, the International Coffees are no bargain; so it'll be Caf&eacute; D'Vita from now on.
4725	3	I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.  You end up with a mess on your hands.  Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!
4726	4	If you like coffee but can not stop to get some these coffee flavored candies are just right, a bit hard to unwrap but hits the spot.
4727	4	Ok, so it's not exactly  ice cream,  but it scratches that itch.  I can sit down and eat a whole pint of this stuff for only 150 calories.  I love that.  I've read mixed reviews, some like this stuff others hate it.  I love it!  I want to try the cookies and cream next...<br /><br />That said, it's very expensive so I only purchase now and then, so it won't be for awhile.
4728	4	I love licorice, but I have to admit that my  go-to  licorice is definitely Twizzlers. But, when I heard about this intriguing flavor, I had to try it. And I am glad that I did! It was really tasty! Not overpoweringly sweet, or too overwhelmingly fruity, the balance of licorice flavor and pomegranate fruit was quite perfect. They are also, unlike Twizzlers, already in a perfect straw style, ready to spruce up a summery lemonade as a fun licorice straw! I definitely am not interested in sampling the other flavors.<br />The only downside is that they are rather sticky, both to the touch and to the teeth after eating. These would not be possible for people with braces or fragile dental work! But the strong-toothed will definitely enjoy them!
4729	5	By far my favorite K-Cup- good price- fast delivery as well! This coffee is a light blend, not too bold and not too acidic. I will definitely purchase again!
4730	5	This was a great find.  A flavorful mixture of red and brown whole grain rice in 2-lb containers.  I'm putting them in food gift baskets for Christmas.
4731	5	I have a Basenji dog who, from time to time, becomes rather picky about what he eats.  So far he has never refused to eat any of the Cesar Canine Cusine varieties and usually consumes them as soon as he can get at his bowl.<br />I am very pleased with his condition, very active and a shiny coat and none of the bad breath, which occurred with other foods.
4732	5	I got this for work because I don't have a grinder there.  I like some nice coffee when I finish seeing patients and as I tackle the records, phone calls, review reports that have arrived that day- several hours of work after the front door is locked.<br />This is as described, very special, and I have found that Gevalia coffee is reliable.<br />A small cup of fresh hot special coffee and a few almonds makes it much easier to face that part of the day.
4733	4	This is one of our favor KCups but I wonder why Green Mountain chose to put only 24 cups in the box instead of the original 25.  Seems pretty petty to me.<br />Otherwise, it's a great flavor...particularly with larger cups of coffee.
4734	5	My dog loves this toy! She will actually go to the shelf where we store it and bark until we give it to her. I usually put a variety of treats in it, including peanut butter. It's easy to clean, keeps my dog occupied for hours (provided I keep filling it with treats), and really I don't have anything negative to say about it. I definitely recommend it!
4735	3	This is a decent Chai latte.. not the best I've ever had, but certainly the best I've found for the Keurig.  It seems a bit watered down and doesn't have the impact of the spice that I like in Chai.  Just aroma and spice-wise, I actually prefer the Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai k-cups with a bit of milk added after it's done (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XHI/ref=oh_o01_s01_i01_details).
4736	5	These are sooo delicious! I havent had any other nut mix that was quite as fresh and sweet. Love it. Highly recommend. Oh, and the packages are decent sizes.
4737	5	to all of you gluten free people out there who thought that you couldn't eat Chocolate Chip cookies anymore- think again!  These are so delicisious taht you won't miss the wheat!  They are the best wheat free cookies I've found.  I could eat half a box at a time but I try not to!  :)
4738	1	After wasting many batches of these nuggets I finally got them to puff up properly and was excited to try some that were not still rock hard.<br />What I found was that the texture is not very appealing and they smell horrific. I know most pork rinds smell funny but these were extremely pungent and the after taste was even worse.<br /><br />I ended up just throwing away the whole bag because I was not interested in ever having that taste in my mouth again.<br /><br />Great idea. Was excited to try..  but these just fell way short.
4739	5	My cat will only eat fish (no kidding).  How convenient it is to have his favorite variety pack automatically sent!  No more lugging all those cans from the store.  Also, the product is of good quality.  He enjoys it!
4740	4	i like illy in general and this makes a very drink.  a little bit more bitter than illy cappuccino and just the right size.
4741	1	This is awful. It had an off-putting medicinal taste. Maybe if it was smothered in icing it would be better, but don't waste your money. I made it according to the directions and served it to people at Thanksgiving and not a single person liked it. I threw the whole thing away. It has nice texture and is attractive but the taste of this mix is just wrong.
4742	4	In the past, the Donut House K-Cups have been of the highest quality & would have been rated 5 stars. However, even tho the quality of the product is still there, the last time I received the 80 pack, several of the K-Cups were broken & the coffee missing. Some of them were broken within the box & the coffee was everywhere. That is the reason for the 4 star rating - will order them once more to see if the last order was an anomaly.
4743	5	These little chocolate bites give you the pleasing sensation of chocolate - without the guilt of the sugar calories!!  Great job Murray!!
4744	4	I'm quite choosy about my hygienic products -- toothpastes, soaps, washes and so on. In an effort to find a bath wash that wasn't too obnoxious or coarse in it's ingredients, I've been through a couple brands. Knowing this, this one came as a gift from my girlfriend at the time. So far, this is one of my favorites. I don't really have sensitive skin per se but the mildness of both it's fragrance and it's texture, or lack thereof, work good for my skin. The only minus, though I personally don't mind, is that it is advertised as  unscented  yet a scent is clearly apparent.<br /><br />It has no impact on the actual relevance of the product as a cleansing agent but I really like the look of the graphic design and industrial design of the product itself. The color scheme is nice and the bottle is easy to handle without slipping out of my hands. When the bath soap is getting low it also seems to do well at getting the last bits out unlike a lot of other brands I've tried where you have to pound the thing to get the last quarter of liquid out. The upside down orientation of the nozzle helps with this tremendously as does the shape of the bottle, I assume. Pretty good!
4745	1	These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these  thin crisps  cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones.
4746	3	I bought kelp to enrich my diet with iodine, hoping to substitute it for salt.<br />I find it crunchy, with an not altogether pleasing taste.  It's not on top of my list of recommendations.
4747	5	They looked super cute on cupcakes and tasted good too!  There were plenty in the package for way more cupcakes then I made.  I made about 24 cupcakes and have a lot left over.
4748	5	These mixes are excellent for people with gluten issues.  The Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is by far the<br /><br />best of all their products and I have been using it for 3 years.  These are superb,  even though they are<br /><br />gluten free.  Add chopped pecans and they are even better.  Just make sure you follow the directions and<br /><br />freeze before cutting.<br /><br />The price is excellent also, much better than any store I shop in.
4749	5	This porcini powder tastes wonderful. It adds a deep richness and depth to tomato sauces and especially any type of Italian recipe. It's concentrated so don't use a ton at once. Has that distinctive mushroom smell when you open the top, but adds sooo much flavor to my cooking. Great in soups, too!
4750	4	A great treat that your dogs will love. Even our slightly picky dogs love these treats. They clean their teeth too! Also, they don't smell like some rawhides and other natural products. I wish the lasted a little longer - our larger dog eats his in a couple of minutes.
4751	4	I use powdered peanut butter for cooking and smoothies. I'm not as crazy about it for PB&J, but it definitely works for dishes like Thai peanut sauce and peanut butter pie while saving calories. However, the cost of a small jar of this stuff is ridiculous! I buy 2.5 pounds of it for $13.90 with $4.49 shipping on ANY amount. Just do a search for Honeyville powdered peanut butter. The stuff will last 5-10 years sealed in the #10 can it comes in.
4752	5	WE MADE THIS IN THE DRIP COFFEE MAKER -- SO GOOD!<br /><br />WE MADE THIS IN THE FRENCH PRESS -- TASTEY AS EVER!<br /><br />WE MADE THIS IN OUR STOVE TOP ESPRESSO MAKER -- LICKED THE CUP!<br /><br />WE MADE THIS IN MY FATHER-IN-LAW'S $2,000 ESPRESSO MAKER -- WHOA MOMMA!<br /><br />IT WAS ALL SO VERY DELICIOUS AND NOW I AM SO CAFFEINATED I THINK MY HEART IS GOING TO EXPLODE.
4753	4	We liked these.  Quite good, even if they're 'healthy' @ 100 calories & 3 whole fat grams a bag. My favorites are the plain, the others are very strong flavored, very zippy!
4754	1	<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032KP28 >Jules Destrooper, Cookie Thins Almond 100G, 3.5-Ounce</a> This proved to be an all time ripoff. I was expecting a broken case of cookies. I received 1 box of cookies worth $3 - paid $9.95 for the cookies, plus $6.30 for shipping. $16.25 for a $3 value. Never again will I shop Amazon.  Richard Rossi
4755	4	I am not a big coffee drinker, but these little single serving cups make a hot, fresh cup of coffee that even  tea  drinkers like me are tempted to chug down. The Vermont blend is one of the best flavors Green Mountain Coffee makes.
4756	5	These are a great size for an evening snack.  My dog loves them and  insists  on having one or two every night.
4757	5	Necta Sweet are easy to use artificial sweetener pills that taste like sweet n low, but without all the messy packaging.  I don't know why they are no longer in the grocery stores in California and I have been buying them when I visit my grandkids in Oregon and Florida.  I was out with no trips planned and on a whim thought I'd try Amazon.  I found just what I wanted and three days later the mail man delivered about a year's supply.  I am very happy with the service and will look here first next time.
4758	4	This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores (and Cost Plus World Market) stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag. I drink my tea black, but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Cognoscenti typically prefer loose tea. Tea bags contain the less expensive  fannings  or  dust,  remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), many people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea.
4759	5	I can't recommend this highly enough!!!  It's so easy and the taste is out of this world!  You MUST try it!
4760	5	I bought the wrong item.  These chips were disappointing.  The regular Garden of Eatin' Black Bean tortilla chips are high in fiber (4 grams) but these chips are only 2 grams.  Sorry I bought them.
4761	5	Good to have two instead of one on the shelf.  This cereal goes fast at my house.  Lots of flavor, and lots of crunch.  Some sugar, but not too much.  No soy.
4762	5	Let's face it. If you have Celiac disease and have to be Gulten free you are very limited in what you can eat. Before I was diagnosed I loved pretzels and while nothing Gulten free tastes as good as the real thing this products comes very close. I now eat them every day and buy the product by the case. I would highly recommend to anyone who cannot eat Gulten to try this product as in my case it is a life saver!
4763	5	Recommend it to all.  Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker.  I loved it during a URI, upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous.  Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing.  I now brew it for cold tea as well.  Very refresshing.
4764	5	Been using this product for over 10 years on long distance rides, including centuries.  Have tried them all.  As another reviewer said, this isn't a  tasty  drink to have on the patio, but if you want to keep your legs from cramping, this stuff WORKS!!  I won't go on a long ride without it.
4765	4	Not bad for a bottle of water. We received this as a sample, and it had a pleasant enough taste with no unpleasant after-taste.
4766	5	I really like this tea.  I originally bought the package which comes with 6 boxes containing 18 teabags each.  When that was gone, I ordered the 100 count box.  I am told that oolong tea is good for you, so I'm glad this white peach type is to my liking.
4767	4	The whole chocolate and healthy kettle corn was just too appealing for me to resist so I ordered this product.  The kettle corn part of this snack is much better tasting to me than other brands of kettle corn.  You can still taste the popcorn and you're not damaging your teeth trying to crunch through whatever sweetener the competition uses on their kettle corn. Nutritionally, this product is as healthy as a snack of this sort can be.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the chocolate part fell short for me.<br /><br />It's just cocoa powder on popcorn so the brown kernels are cocoa tasting and not chocolate tasting as I had hoped.  Also not very sweet.  If you are a person who likes very dark chocolate and not so much the sweetness, you will probably love this product.<br /><br />Re packaging and shipping, the product arrived in perfect condition which all  bags sealed and the same condition you'd find it in at the store.
4768	4	The flour as it is too gritty so sifting is necessary.<br /><br />Sifting 32 oz bag of the flour gave me 5 oz of rice  semolina  which consisted about 16% of the total volume. But stuff is good and price is good too, just realize that factually you are buying 27 oz of rice flour instead 32 oz. If you have a nice recipe to utilize rice semolina it doesn't seem to be a problem.
4769	1	I'm usually impressed with this brand's stevia products, but not with these individually packed ones. These don't taste sweet in the slightest; tastes more like paper! Also, the ones I got were packed in a white wrapper, not blue like the picture shows.
4770	5	I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.  Nice to buy them on sale or in bulk because they can be expensive.<br /><br />I like both fruit flavors of this product, but not as much the chocolate or cinnamon flavors.  I'm hoping they'll introduce more fruit flavors in the future.
4771	5	I have purchased different wine kits from Amazon.com and I have had success in everyone I made up. The Zin is ready to bottle now. It's Delicious and the Price could not be beaten anywhere I looked. Im happy with this Vino Italiano Wine Kit.<br /><br />Viva La Amazon.com. lol
4772	2	I gave an exhaustive opinion of this product when I submitted an opinion of the biscotti in comparison to that which I really wanted: carmel lattee
4773	5	I absolutely love peanut butter but it's such a high calorie food that I really have to limit my consumption. My typical morning begins with a bowl of oatmeal which I like to mix about 150 calories worth of peanut butter into. I recently discovered this product and decided to give it a shot in hopes that I could shave a few calories off of my oatmeal and this product didn't disappoint! I admit it lacks the creaminess you get from real peanut butter but all the flavor is there at a fraction of the calories and fat! My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2! I haven't tried using it in anything else just yet but this one change in my diet has made the product worth it to me!
4774	4	We don't have a pod brewer so we put a couple of these in the coffeepot and brewed water thru it. Yum!  Normally I like a strong coffee, and this was milder than my usual, but the flavor was terrific! Very smooth and totally delicious.
4775	5	I have tried at least 25 types of low or lower carb pastas.  Some have been so bad that my family and I take one bite and throw the rest out.  This pasta is GOOD! And, I weigh myself every day, since I am on a very low carb diet and have lost 30 pounds.  I did not gain weight with this, eating one  1 & 1/2 cup portion, and I often do if I sneak in some regular pasta or bread.
4776	1	I was disappointed to learn that General Mills sold this product to Diamond Foods (the nut company) in early 2009.  Since then, Pop Secret Homestyle has become unrecognizable.  The kernels are larger than they used to be and they have so many husks that it chokes you to swallow it.  Not to mention the fact that you need to keep toothpicks and dental floss nearby! Oh, and make sure you have something to drink handy while eating it because of the choking issue. It it really unpleasant!  They also did something to the flavor.  I suspect that they no longer use real butter because now it has no flavor at all.  It is just salty and greasy.<br /><br />I used to have trouble keeping Pop Secret in my house because it would be devoured as soon as I bought it.  Now I have had 4 boxes sitting in my pantry for months that nobody will touch.  I don't believe I have ever before experienced such a drastic and disappointing change in a product that I used to love so much.  Guess I'll have to switch to Orville now.
4777	5	Great tasting.  Kids love them and I don't have to worry that there are any genetically engineered ingredients.  A little pricey if you don't care if they are organic.
4778	1	The picture shown on amazon was not the product shipped.  I received blanced almonds (which are slightly processed - not RAW) and the bags were not 5 oz but labeled 4.5 oz.  Very dissapointed!
4779	5	I can't believe these are healthy for you as they are so yummy. I love them. I will be ordering more in the near future.
4780	4	My husband is a marathon gum chewer.  He often chews the same piece of gum for up to 6 hours while at work.  He says that this gum has a nice texture.  It's good for blowing small bubbles and cracking them.  The flavor is good too, not too strong, but just right.  However, after about 3 or 4 hours the flavor and texture start to deteriorate and he has to switch to a new piece.<br /><br />Most people don't chew gum for that length of time anyway.  So this should be good for just about anyone.<br /><br />We got the Awaken kind, and we didn't really notice that it helps us keep awake long term.  But perhaps when you first put it in your mouth, the burst of flavor from the liquid center might wake you up just a little bit.<br /><br />We like it and will probably try it again.
4781	5	Vega Real is premium roasted cocoa! Not milk chocolate. It brews like coffee, I treat it as such. I prepare it in much the same way i would my coffee,except I use a Bodum Brazil 8 cup French Press Coffee Maker. Straight it taste like an unsweetened dark chocolate, slightly bitter, but takes well to sweetener or creamer. I love the aroma every time I open the resealable bag cocoa fills the room, taste, and health benefits. I try to stay away from caffeine. Will buy more.
4782	5	BEST WILD MOUNTAIN BLACKBERRY JAM I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUY. THHESE ARE THE TRUE SEEDLESS BLACKBERRIES
4783	1	These berries are just gross. When I opened the bag, the odor turned me off immediately. Also, they aren't just dry, but rather like small stones. They made me think of the stuff you put in the bottom of fish tanks. Again, not something I was looking forward to eating.<br /><br />Their texture is again very dry. They feel like small pebbles in my hand. After tossing them into my mouth, and crunching a bit, they are very juicy. I'm not sure if I like the flavor because I'm thrown off by the nasty after taste, like grain. I don't know if you've ever smelled rabbit food or grain for horses. (I grew up with horses.) This is what the stuff smells like to me. Moreover, I imagine had I tried grain, it would taste like that: grain and berries. Gross.<br /><br />I got the pack of two so I could give a pouch to my sister-in-law for Christmas. I hope she likes the berries. Perhaps they would be better in smoothies, but I'm reluctant to try.<br /><br />If they didn't have the funky after taste, I'd like them better. Oh, and the smell. Gross.
4784	1	1 star is about all it deserves, because they got the package on time...the problem is, they sent a 6 pack of 12. oz cans, not the 66.7 ounce bottles as promised.<br /><br />Why do they have to lie to sell their product? this can't be a mistake, seeing as they mention twice in the description that it's six bottles of 66.7 ounces each.<br /><br />Get it from another vendor, who won't rip you off or lie to you to sell you what is otherwise a great soda.
4785	5	Millstone Breafast Blend coffee is the mildest of all the coffees I have tried. I also like high caffeine coffee. Remember: Light roast = high caffeine. Most people think the opposite.<br /><br />Anyway, I like this, and the price is very reasonable. Note: It is NOT for people who like the taste of dark roast coffee.
4786	5	Add a Tablespoon of this chicory when brewing...just enhances the flavor of your coffee!  Discovered chicory in New Orleans & now I can enjoy in my own home in any flavor coffee i brew.
4787	5	Celestial Sleepytime Extra is terrific! I've always liked the taste of Sleepytime--love chamomile--but was concerned about the addition of valerian. Valerian is a powerful, natural sleep aid, but I hate the aftertaste when taken in pill form. Luckily, this tea still tastes good and helps make you fall asleep easily.
4788	5	As the subject states, quick delivery and these snacks are always delicious.  Considering they delivered to an APO Box, it arrived quickly.  Very pleased.
4789	4	if you can't make it to durgan park or your fav restaurant that serves up great indian pudding this is a pretty<br />good alternative.  just warm, add vanilla ice cream or whipped cream and serve.  a great at home treat.
4790	5	I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock, but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more.
4791	3	I used this for many months a few years ago. By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things.
4792	3	I'm disappointed in this popcorn. After reading the reviews, I thought it would be fantastic. I made it in my Whirley Popper. It doesn't even come close to movie popcorn. People complained that it was too salty. Not my batch. And, no buttery taste. Bummer......
4793	3	Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.
4794	5	I admit, I am a starbucks Via addict. It is fast, convenient and now affordable. I used to buy this product at Costco, now I don't have to drive there to get it for the price. I do drink one or two daily so this will last me for about a month. The expiration date on this was March 2013, almost 9 months. I would order again. 5 stars for the cost and convenience! thanks starbucks and amazon!
4795	5	I had never had matcha before and wanted to try it for the adults in the family who want a good supply of energy and antioxidants, too.  I used this to make a mocha matcha latte, adding it to my morning glass of chocolate skim milk, and it tastes like a pricey coffee shop drink!  I can't wait until my daughter comes home so she can try it, I know she will be hooked.
4796	4	This is good for packaged ground coffee, and for decaf, it definitely has a strong coffee flavor. This is great for that winding down cup of coffee late night that won't keep you up because of the caffeine.<br /><br />Each sealed package holds ten ounces of extra-fine ground coffee. The bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packaging.<br /><br />With coffee prices going up, it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this (if you try this and like it, you get a better price with the Amazon Subscribe & Save option) versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you.
4797	5	I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.
4798	5	I've been buying these soups as a matter of cheap thrills and convenience. They are probably best used as a no-fuss and light lunch st work and school. Not all of the flavors are created equal, however. I rank the ones I've tried as follows:<br /><br />1. Tomato Parmesan<br />2. Cream of broccoli<br />3. New England clam chowder.<br /><br />The first two are very tasty. The third is a bit bland but still pretty decent.<br /><br />I can think of three advantages of going with this product:<br /><br />1. Cost. Bloom charges me $1.89 a can for this soup. Amazon's subscription plans often make the soup significantly less expensive.<br /><br />2. Ease of preparation. Just shake, microwave for 90 seconds, and you're ready to go. No other cooking utensils or preparation is required. The metal rims on the containers do not cause sparking. Pretty neat.<br /><br />3. Ease of consumption. Just sip from the container, which seems to be a foam material or plastic that doesn't conduct much heat and is easy to hold. It fits easily into car cup holders. No spoons or bowls are required.<br /><br />Anyone on a low-salt diet should think twice. The soups have 30+ percent of the RDA. The fat content is a bit elevated. These things are to maintain the flavor. Calories don't go above 220 or so.<br /><br />All in all, these soups have turned out to be an unexpected winner. I expect to be buying more.
4799	3	This is a good basic white tea.  I really enjoy the flavor but the after taste is a bit on the harsher side like a cheap green.  I prefer something a bit smoother. Great Value, though!
4800	4	I brew this espresso in a Bialetti moka pot. It has a nice flavor. Rich and strong, but yet not that bitter, dark, over-roasted, burnt flavor. Also, 4 bricks at this price is a good value for the quality of this coffee.
4801	1	Has a nice mellower taste than store bought heat-processed table salt.<br /><br />No Iodine, so I supplement with 4 drops of good tasting Liquid Dulse <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014HV48 >Bernard Jensen Products - Liquid Dulse, 4 oz liquid</a> (also Very good to FILL thyroid with GOOD iodine!- Keeps from taking in any Radioactive iodine from Japan reactor spill!- Radioactive iodine does Permanent damage to thyroid, and can't be reversed! Radioactivity is sure to work into our food supply...!)<br /><br />Per my dentist (for everyone)- I started gargling with 1/4tsp salt in 8oz of water after brushing.<br />It is VERY unnerving to see the undissolved black/brown specs floating around!<br /><br />The other unprocessed sea salt brands come from  Less  pristine waters, but I'll give them a try next time.
4802	2	I like some of the other Go Raw items but the Pizza Flax Snax were just not good. They were brittle and dry and tasted like they had some snad in them... I dont know It tasted like some one to Pizza Misses Dash and put it on Flax and Sunflower seeds. I so wish i hadnt of got this...<br /><br />The Pumpkin and Speralina are super good.. get those.. dont get this.
4803	5	I have a chow mix and a husky. My chow eats anything and is on the Wellness Healthy Weight (chicken flavor). My husky is really picky. She finally ate the Wellness puppy chow when she was a puppy after refusing to eat many other brands. At almost 2 years old I really wanted to change her to  big girl  dog food. She is still pretty skinny, because she is so active and still did not eat very much. I decided to switch her to the Wellness Core, but she constantly vomited. So I got the Wellness Fish and Sweet Potato since her puppy food had sweet potato in it too - hoping that she would eat it. NOPE. I guess she does not like fish!!! :-( Then I noticed that she likes my chows chicken flavored food, but the low calorie food was not ideal for her since she needs to put on a few lbs. So I finally tried this one ......... and BINGO ........... She LOVES IT!!! She can't get enough of it and always wants more. I am very happy with this food!!! And even better - it shipped from a location 30 min from my house, so ones it was shipped I had it the next day! The price is also about $10 lower than where I used to order Wellness before!!! So this is where I will always get it from now on! Thanks for fast shipping and a great price! I also recommend Wellness - its really a great food with real meat and NOT byproducts and tons of corn! ;) Your dog will love you for getting a great food!!! :)
4804	4	'<br /><br />I ran out of coffee and a friend had been talking about blue mountain coffee blended in a desert.  That sounded different for a coffee so I decided to try some.<br /><br />Magnum Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is better than I suspected.  It is rich and flavorful, with slight acidity.  I drank this coffee in the morning, but I think it would be tasty with evening desert.  This is a decent coffee that I will use again.
4805	3	My family is nuts about these chips. We had a problem with shipment, as many of the sacks had the air squished out of them and were stale. I contacted customer service and they are going to make it right. We live 50 miles from the nearest store, so we are grateful for the convenience of free shipping. With three boys scattered all over the place, I appreciate the handy single-serve sacks. That way, they don't sit down and eat an entire large bag.
4806	2	My favorite salad dressing is raspberry vinaigrette, but this particular brand is terrible. It's so tasteless and runny it's like pouring water all over my salad and making it sobbing wet with moisture. Because I had to purchase this in bulk, I am now stuck with 6 of these terrible dressings.
4807	1	The packets were pictured in a display box, which is how I wanted to receive them. Not only did they come without the box, but they were also busted open, I assume due to a change in air pressure during transit. Because I couldn't trust that, though, I had to throw most of the order away.
4808	2	I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though.
4809	5	I first ran across the Double Bergamot by accident.  I love Earl Grey, and I have enjoyed many other Stash teas in the past (if you haven't tried the Chocolate Hazelnut yet, go order some now.  I'll wait...).  I tried this one, and it was like a ramped-up version of Earl Grey.  The bergamot oil is what makes Earl Grey, well, Earl Grey.  Doubling that oil just intensifies the flavor.  Great for a late weekend afternoon reading my Kindle.  I even keep a bunch in my office to get me through the last couple of hours!
4810	2	Quite tasteless and they make you order so many. I am stuck with 12 bags of this tasteless stuff. I am not ordering large amounts of anything from Amazon again. So often I don't like it and I am stuck with so much on hand.
4811	5	Stumbled upon this great product while on vacation.  We only bought one bottle......and we were sorry! It is absolutely delicious!  And particularly delicious with vodka!! Not too sweet at all.  If you like the taste of cucumber you will love this soda.
4812	5	Nice alternative to Sugar in the Raw. It tells our customers about who we are and that we care about quality products.
4813	5	Me dieron dos cajas cuando naci&oacute; mi hija, y yo simplemente no confiaba mucho en el tema. Pero es ABSOLUTAMENTE maravilloso. De efecto r&aacute;pido (mucho m&aacute;s que el motilium) y son de gran eficiencia.<br /><br />Muy recomendado para qui&eacute;n necesite producir m&aacute;s leche
4814	4	We recently got two 5-month old cats from the shelter.  They both love the regular Kitten Wellness in the pink can, but for some reason won't touch this Core formula.  They'll eat several other brands and other Wellness formulas, so the reason is not that they only like one product.  The regular formula still happens to be grain-free, so we will not be buying the Core again.  I still gave this product 4 stars because it looks like a quality product and is grain-free and chicken-based.
4815	4	Cafix IS the coffee substitute that tastes most like coffee, and this pack of 6 from Amazon is the best deal you'll find. But, I first bought Cafix packaged in a glass jar and having a granular consistency. LOVED it! This Cafix is packaged in canisters and is a powder. It tastes different. Not bad. Just different. To me it has a very nutty taste. I like the glass jar Cafix better, but I can also drink the canister kind. Some people, however, might not like the nuttier taste. Just FYI.
4816	5	A pinch of this truffle and salt mixture transforms any dish into a gastronomic delight! I use it every day. Fortunately, a little goes a very long way.
4817	5	These caramel apple pops are great and taste real similar to a caramel apple.  I can't believe people take the time to complain about the unevenness of flavor of all things.  How could anyone even notice that?  To me, they taste great and I will continue to buy these.
4818	5	I always drank another brand til I tried 8 O'clock.  Now I'm a big fan.  Amazon has a great deal on it too.
4819	5	I came across this product by raiding my local Japanese deli.<br /><br />The taste is excellent. Strawberry and chocolate flavors fit in seamlessly and complement each other. Fruit cuts the sweetness, while the chocolate eliminates the (possible) sourness. Overall flavor is creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />I find myself reaching into the box for the next bite size candy... until there are none left. Although less gluttonous people may not experience the same issue.
4820	1	How does a multimillion dollar company ship a product to it's customers in a paper bag? Yes, it came in a shipping box...but the product itself (24 flavored K-Cups) were all thrown inside an unmarked brown bag and stapled. Leads one to believe that they're cashing in on unsellable broken boxes of K-Cups, sad part is that they're still getting PRIME FULL PRICE!!! Well, a lesson has been learned and I will not purchase this  item  again...Thanks Amazon! And by the way, almost a third of the contents were that disgusting GROVE SQUARE brand and various decaf (of which we don't drink!) Such a convenient way to dump your stock of the brands & brews that don't move! Shopping via the internet is okay most times but it can damn sure bite you in the ass as well. The only reason they got ONE STAR is because of the Kahlua Blend, which was very good.
4821	4	This is one of my favorite winter teas! The ginger-peach flavor is absolutely wonderful, especially when I have a cold or flu. Next time, I won't order this specific packaging. I expected the tea bags to be arranged in rows in a box, but STASH appears to have dumped and squashed 100 tea bags into too small of a box. The individual packs are crumpled, folded and mangled. If you prefer more pristine tea bags, order the multi-pack box.
4822	4	Though the idea of graham crackers is not new, the individual packaging is. The packaging makes taking the crackers along very convenient. Plus, they do stay fresh longer. I highly recommend.
4823	5	I am the companion to a small dog of unknown age and breed who has been troubled with a tender tummy for a few years.  Her vet has tons of medications to give her, but I don't need any of them since I tried the Wellness brand dry dog food and the moist.<br /><br />All her problems gave gone away.  It is amazing.  She has not been to the vet since her last yearly checkup.
4824	1	Um.... These are. $1-$1.89 per pouch in stores, or $7-8 per 6 pack. Where do you off selling a 6 pack for $24.99???
4825	5	I just bought these today and since I've almost eaten the whole bag I had to find 'em cheaper than they were at my grocery store.
4826	5	Wow, I have always thought of the marathon bars I would eat when I was younger. This is as close as it gets. They were delicious.
4827	5	great deal, especially for the price. Item arrived quicker than anticipated. This has saved me many trips to Dunkin Doniuts as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate that's just as good. Looking for more to stockpile!
4828	4	I love the 18 Rabbits product.  I tried a couple of their flavors and I like the ones w/ dates and raisins and the other with dried cherries.  Their bars are very simple, not overly sweet.  It's truly like eating very good granola that is held together with honey.  They aren't very filling, but make a nice in between meal snack.
4829	2	They taste like cardboard and vanilla air freshener. Not worth the price. I think that they were old when I received them.
4830	5	I consider myself somewhat of a chip connoisseur, and while Tim's Jalapeno Cascade style chips used to be my favorite, these ones are healthier and comparably delicious, if slightly more expensive. Great product overall.
4831	1	I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its  food . and the company who makes it basically said  Sorry, but it sucks to be you . So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.
4832	5	I was alerted to these by a friend who thought they sounded delicious. So I got them. Wow. They are SO yummy! Each chocolate is individually wrapped inside the bag. When you break open, you see a dark chocolate. When the chocolate touches the tongue, you get a creamy dark chocolate taste, no artificial taste or that unpleasant taste sugar free chocolate often have. And as you suck on this, you start tasting the raspberry. It's so rich and smooth, however, don't overdo it! If you eat more than recommended doses, it will give you an unpleasant taste. It may also act as a laxative...
4833	2	Beans are not dark or oily, very mild flavor. Beans are not consistant in color, this means the beans are not roasted evenly. I hate to say it but Starbucks is 3 times better. I will try other french roast from amazon.<br /><br />All orders from amazon arrived on time.
4834	5	I love this coffee more than any other I've ever tried.  It's simply perfect.<br /><br />I do find it odd that the 48 count is over twice the cost of the 24 count but that's nothing major.  I just think it's weird and only people who are worse at math than me would buy the 48 count instead of the 24 count.  (There can't be many people worse at math than me...  I'm pretty bad.)<br /><br />Fantastic coffee though. I highly recommend it if you want a light, pleasant coffee.
4835	2	I wanted to try these because the name was catchy, the packaging was bright and colorful and I really like the taste and crunch of freeze dried fruit for snacking. I also purchased this item because it contained a variety of flavors to taste test.  Unfortunately, For a variety pack I didn't find a whole lot of variety. Two of the four flavors were primarily bananas -- Purple Funk (bananas with an acai coating) and Bananamon (bananas with a cinnamon). The flavor I preferred was Jivalime (pineapple and lime). It has a very robust flavor.  The lime is strong and makes it very tart. The Carnival mix was just OK. This was a mixture of banana, pineapple, apple, papaya, and raisins. The pieces were very small in this mix.  I would have preferred  bigger pieces of papaya, apple and pineapple.<br /><br />There are several other freeze-dried fruit mixes that I personally like better - perhaps because they have more traditional flavors. The Crispy Green product line is a favorite of mine and is comparable price-wise to the Funky Monkey products. For great peach flavor try Crispy Green Fruit Snacks, Crispy Peaches, 2.2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3).  I also like the Crispy Green dried pineapple snack  Crispy Green Fruit Snacks, Crispy Pineapples, 2.2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3).  With Crispy Green you get 3 individual serving bags inside of a bigger bag. You actually get 9 bags of snacks. The extra packaging really does keep the fruit crispy and great tasting for a long time.<br /><br />Sensible Foods also makes a delicious crispy snack called <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYRHL2 >Sensible Foods Crunch Dried Snacks, Cherry Berry, 0.75-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> - great crunch and flavor.  Cherry Berry is my personal favorite but Sensible Foods has several other tasty flavors, too, including a tropical fruit mix.
4836	1	This product is NOT almond flour!  It is white rice flour, tapioca flour, potato starch, sweet rice flour, and almond meal flour.  This is a very deceptive listing.  I cannot eat any of the other ingredients in this product.  I want a return and full refund to include shipping.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Sandy Krisko
4837	5	I saw these in the supermarket at the checkout line and picked up the clusters. I figured they would taste bland and not be satisfying for the chocolate craving. While there aren't many in the package, I think five or six clusters, they are tasty and definitely fix your urge for something sweet.<br /><br />I love the clusters and the peanut butter bar. The regular chocolate bar is tasty but I prefer it mixed with caramel or peanut butter. They are between 110-120 calories which is a great little snack, equivalent to some of the other snack bars like Special K.<br /><br />The bars are heavenly crisps (think nutty bar but thinner). So they are wafers with chocolate or peanut butter between each layer.<br /><br />I love this variety back and thought it was a good value. I paid $1.25 for the clusters at the grocery store so under a dollar a snack works for me.<br /><br />Highly suggest to those watching their calories but unable to kick their sweet tooth. Quick shipping too.
4838	5	We really enjoy the Kona K-cups.  My husband prefers a bold coffee and drinks it black.  I prefer a milder coffee and use raw brown sugar and 1/2 and 1/2. The Kona is great either way!  Over the years we have tried many flavors of K-cups and the Kona does not leave a bitter aftertaste and is on our list of the ones to always have on automatic delivery!
4839	1	The ingredients clearly say  evaporated cane juice .  That is sugar.  Amazon needs to change the description.
4840	4	Doing a food item is always difficult, individual taste and preference being a major reason why we like or dislike something.  Breakfast cereal might be one of the more difficult items.  Having written disclaimers, here is my review.<br />This is a heavily sweetened item with 120 calories in ¾ of a cup.  In addition, there are peanut chips stuck to the flakes.  Honey and molasses are the major sweeteners.  The result is a corn flake with peanut slivers and honey that has a sweet pleasant taste.  The flakes hold up well in milk or can be eaten dry as a snack.  I think this would make an excellent base for a sweet trail mix snack.  My two-year old grandson likes them dry in his dish as a snack.<br />This might be an alternate to the heavily sugar sweeten cereals but is not a good choice for anyone looking to control their weight.
4841	5	I have been eating these forever! Since I was a kid. I have been buying them at a Whole Foods where I live but buying them off Amazon is cheaper. Don't eat these thinking they are like licorice flavored or even like twizzlers. They have a very deep fruit flavor, maybe not even raspberry but berryish. Watch if you don't eat a whole box in one day.
4842	5	We have been dedicated to this brand and type of tea for some years. We found several online sources. This is the best. If, for some reason, you have not tried  Yorkshire Gold,  do yourself a favor and do so.
4843	3	I ordered three boxes of Maple Grove Farms Maple Cream Cookies but received three boxes of Dare Brand maple cookies.  Both brands were sold by the same company.I understand now that they were out of the Maple Farms brand so switched to the Dare brand.  Why didn't they tell me they were out of the Maple Farms brand when I ordered??  Won't buy again if this is the way they do business.
4844	4	This is darn good coffee! I wound up ripping open the individual packets and just poring the grounds into filters for my regular drip coffee maker. But it's a nice rich flavor anyway, especially for pre-ground. And what a cool package! I mean, who doesn't like Bob Marley? Plus it says right on the box  organic, ethically farmed,  which I'm inclined to believe; somebody's gotta check on that stuff, right? Holy recommended.
4845	3	quality of the product was sufficient given that it's packaged pretzels and chocolate (if you don't know what you're getting into, it's pretty much that: chocolate on the outside of a long pretzel stick), BUT. order it in the summer and expect to receive some very well heated chocolate. I open mine up (after letting it cool) to find a monstrosity of fused chocolate and snapped pretzel. I will be trying to order these again when the weather permits the transit of something with such a low melting point, and may update my review at that point.
4846	5	I like using the stevia sweetners because they are a natural product. this liquid is great because it mixes with cold liquids, like iced tea and koolaid. I't so super concentrated the container doesn't take up a ton of space
4847	1	I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.<br /><br />I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese  treats 
4848	1	This is the worst gluten-free pancake mix I ever bought in my life!! First I tried it on a well-seasoned iron pan (we don't use  nonstick  pans here because teflon contains harmful chemicals). It stuck so badly after 2 tries that I had to soak the pan... not even brillo (which ruins pans) could get it off. Then, not wanting to waste the rest of the mix I'd made, I got out my nonstick waffle iron, adjusted the recipe and tried again. (I oiled it REALLY WELL with ghee, which works best as a cooking oil to prevent sticking). It stuck to the waffle iron so badly that I had to end up scraping it with a fork. I ruined the waffle iron's surface doing this. The taste of the scraps (I didn't want to throw them away) was all right, very  gooey,  but even the crispy parts got soggy in syrup more than most gluten-free mixes. If only they could find a way to get this to work I guess it would be all right but I am very frustrated right now after disappointing my daughter and ruining my favorite waffle iron and pan. I don't know what people who liked this product did to get it to work. BTW I don't use rice milk, we used regular dairy milk because we're not dairy-allergic or vegans. If this is a problem they should say so on the box, because I ALWAYS do substitutions with pancake mix recipes and it's never usually a problem. Not everyone has rice milk on hand.
4849	5	I buy these for the office and put them in the candy machine from Brookstone.  The partners love them!
4850	4	I loved all the flavors! Vanilla Maple was my favorite. For only 150 calories per pint and some awesome flavors, you can't beat it! I would have liked the combination pack to include the other two or three flavors though (cookies & cream, pumpkin spice, and coffee).
4851	5	These taste great.  They are very soft and filling between meals.  Great to take on hikes and biking.  Give it a go.
4852	5	I bought this to replace my Mr. Coffee K-Cup brewer.  The Mr. Coffee one is okay with most flavors, but I noticed a distinct difference when I tried the Keurig brewer at my apartment complex with a particular brand of coffee I'd had trouble with in the Mr. Coffee maker and noticed an immediate difference.  Good brewer, decent price; best quality for the dollar.
4853	5	These have been the best treats we have found yet.  They are low cal and the perfect size. Our puppy begs us for them even. She knows where they are and goes and stands by them.
4854	2	my cat won't eat anything with fish in it which is why i purchased this variety pack that showed the variety as being chicken, beef and turkey ... it came with four salmon which i couldn't use ... also, it was delivered through usps that wouldn't leave it at the door because i had to sign for it and i was at a doctor's appointment ... so days later i had to find a way to the post office to sign for it and pick it up which i wouldn't have complained quite as much about ordinarily, but i have severe arthritis in my knees which is why i had cat food delivered to my door in the first place.
4855	4	I had no idea how much agar 12 ounces was when I ordered it, but it is a lot!  It comes in a 2'x 2'x 6  box and it was completely full.  If you need only an average amount, do not order this one.  The product it good though.  I am happy with it, I just have enough to last me 20 years.
4856	4	Great gag gift, the flavor doesnt last long but its cheap! I &lt;3 it, my friends love it. Everyone you get it for will lov eit. Obviously not educational.. But, it doesnt even taste that bad!
4857	5	My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did.
4858	5	These have to be the world's best sardines--no sardine odor and no oil.  They are imported from Portugal where they are processed as soon as they are caught, so they don't have time to go stale, which is what causes the bad odor in cheap cans of sardines at the stores.
4859	5	Because my job involves talking all day, and I am constantly surrounded by allergins, I go through cough drops like mad. The way I see it, if you are going to consume something, you might as well enjoy it. Ambrosoli-HoneeEnergy Plus more than fills the bill. I found it to be very soothing, but also had a strong honey flavor that I absolutely LOVED!<br /><br />The very best review I can offer for this product: I am about to order it again, and will be back for more.
4860	5	Over the past decade the Diageo Classic Malts have each offered a  Distiller's Edition  where the primary malt receives additional aging in a second fill cask that once held a vinous product. In Talisker's case they use big grape Oloroso sherry butts. They have a release each year. Reviewed today is the 2005 vintage.<br /><br />Color: rich orangey amber<br /><br />Nose: candied orange peel, white raisins, sherry, brine, band aids, and the characteristic Talisker old hatbox wood.<br /><br />Intense vinous sherry sweetness that builds into midpalate with toffee, citrus and Turkish delight and hard candy flavors. At midpalate the citrus explodes into juicy intensity. At the turn to the finish there's a burst of floral essences - confused and humid like a quick tuck into a steamy raucous flower shop. Then the finish brings the cavalcade of classic maritime flavors up: salt sea air, mineral rock, old attic hatbox wood and a final bitter medicinal iodine note. Wow. I'm dizzy just writing it down. This is a tour de force of delicious flavors melded with maritime weird ones. It's totally recognizable as Talisker - the terroir of Skye is all over it. But the second fill coopering in oloroso sherry casks marries in rich sweet fruits that elevate, not detract. Wonderful!
4861	5	Recently tried some of these at a friends Christmas party... these aren't cookies.  These are addictive little pieces of chocolate covered heaven.... or  cookie Crack .  You can not have just one...here I am days later looking on Amazon just to find my next fix!
4862	5	My husband and I love, love cheez-it's. I only buy the original. Why would anyone want to mess with perfection. Don't buy low fat, because they don't taste the same.
4863	4	I ordered this chap stick looking for something a little more natural that I could feel good about using.  I like that it is certified organic, so I don't feel like I am digesting harmful unnecessary chemicals every time i lick my lips. It has nice mild taste, and goes on really silky.
4864	5	I have a 7 pound dog and she likes this. She is 5 but likes to chew it. Not sure how they get bacon flavor in there cause its hard plastic, cant smell it.
4865	5	Thanks for my Alphabet Cereal ordered from Amazon. It arrived in great condition and very quickly. I was very happy to know I could order it from Amazon because none of our local grocery stores sell or carry this brand  anymore. My whole family was happy once they saw that I had the cereal. We will be ordering from Amazon again! Thanks Amazon!
4866	5	Milka and its famous purple cow, recently purchased by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries. With hazelnut, the crunch and flavor has a pleasant exotic texture.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is not subtle. For me, this is a good thing, and, as a result, I can devour two bars faster than I should.<br /><br />Distribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate, although they also make varieties which include yogurt, nuts and a version with Oreo Cookies. Buy a case of the hazelnut Milka and enjoy!<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, http://HungarianBookstore.com
4867	2	The fact that it is organic is why I purchased it. The taste is somewhat bland, but the real kicker is that it is LOADED with commercial salt....not sea salt mind you.<br /><br />One serving (there are 4 per package) has 230mg! I don't eat that much commercial, overly processed, white table salt in a month! In fact, I get my Himalayan pink crystal salt from Amazon....and this stuff not only tastes great, it is a wonderful food for the body.<br /><br />Serves me right for not checking closer into the ingredients.
4868	5	These were recommended in the class I took when 1st Dxed with diabetes. They work well whenever you don't want to eat more (dieting), or when you won't eat for hours; that includes overnight to help avoid high sugar levels when you wake. In fact, they're very good at helping me get a full night's sleep, uninterrupted by waking up to eat a snack.
4869	4	Natural health reading materials say that Ceylon cinnamon is better than the other store bought cinnamon. So far taste and smell is good but for the food value, I just have to wait to see the result. They say it's good for the brain and that I can use. Also it's supposed to be good for Diabetes. I don't have Diabetes but I hope it will help so I don't get it.<br />My complaint though is not the product but the fact that I was charged for the shipping when it was very clearly stated that it qualifies for free shipping. Indus said they paid for the shipping and why is it that Amazon still charged me for the shipping of more than $6.00. Amazon needs to send me a refund. Thank you.
4870	5	These were better than I remembered. Only thing I don't like are the crumbs at the bottom. I say there should be more chunks!!
4871	1	If your idea of a bar is something sweet and mushy, then go for it. The peanuts and chocolate make a very small fraction of the bar. The rest is just mush. There is no crunch.
4872	5	love this coffee, its a bit light but but very good taste. Works amazing with the kurig machine, easy to use, clean, and fast. I only use kurig machine now and love all the different coffee options..
4873	5	While my husband and daughter have tried several different k-cup coffee choices, their favorite, hands down, is Emeril's Big Easy Bold. The added chicory gives it the home-grown flavor of New Orleans and blends well with the boldness of the coffee. Give it a try, you may like it too.
4874	4	Like the taste:<br />Have bought these before and liked them sprinkled over fruit in the morning...this batch tasted more like dark chocolate, not as bitter as some cacao nibs.<br /><br />Disappointed in such a price jump over a short period of time:<br />I was however a little disappointed that the price increased as much as it did in a short period of time...might look for a less expensive source. Also was not available as well as the powdered cacao for quite awhile, especially around the holiday season when I would have bought some for gifts.
4875	5	I first tasted these at the Bird-in-Hand Farmers Market in Pennsylvania.  They  are sweet without being overbearing.  I like to serve them as a condiment with ham. Sometimes I eat them as a snack.  They are that good!
4876	4	this is exactyl what i have been searching for for over a year.  it was availabe for a while in my local grocery store and was discontinued.  the item arrived in a very timely fashion.
4877	5	I buy Greenies frequently for my dogs. They love them. I buy them for my  granddogs' also. Very good product.
4878	1	I agree with the person who termed these  inedible .  I was sent the wrong flavor and ended up with a box of cocoa-coffee instead of the cocoa raspberry I had ordered.  The bar was bitter and terrible.  I worked on the assumption that perhaps another flavor would be better.  I tried the lemon bar, and although it wasn't bitter, it had basically no flavor and was a lot like what you'd imagine a bar made of birdseed would be.  Do not waste your money on these.
4879	5	These little nuts are so delicious, I can't even describe it.  When I think of glazed nuts, I think of overly sweet totally crystallized with sugar.  It almost held be back from buying these, but they are nothing like that. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to sample them before buying, otherwise I never would have.  They are the perfect amount of sweetness with real fruit pieces that taste like fruit and vanilla!  I would highly recommend these to everyone. Very filling too, unlike most snacks.  You only need to eat a few pieces and you don't feel icky after eating them.
4880	5	My dog has always been fed Wellness. They make a great product. I've always fed him the poultry blend and decided to give this recipe a try. He loves it.<br /><br />I also turned my neighbor on to Wellness for small breeds about 6 months ago for her Yorkie. She has always been under weight at about 3 LBS. She is now up to a healthy 4 LBS and coat looks much better. The groomer even noticed her healthier appearance.<br /><br />This is a fine product!
4881	4	****<br />This Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is actually a type of coconut cream or coconut butter NOT coconut oil. The difference is that the cream or butter is much thicker, has whole coconut in it, and a very strong coconut flavor. You would not use the coconut manna for cooking. It is used more as a spread (which you wouldn't usually do with coconut oil) or can even be eaten by itself or made into a candy (because it is slightly sweet). It can be added to smoothies or used in many other creative ways. Think of it like whole coconut meat in a creamy form.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this coconut manna five stars is because it is hard to actually use. In order to mix the ingredients, which do separate at most normal room temperature, the container must be heated gradually to a very warm room temperature (say 80 degrees, I'd think, or even higher) or else put in hot water for 30 minutes, stirred, and left in hot water for 30 more minutes. Nutiva just began offering this Coconut Manna in this glass jar instead of the previous plastic tub, which is a huge improvement. Still, it is so hard to get it to a consistency in which it can be mixed! I tried heating it in the microwave on the lowest setting (do not do this!) but no matter what I did it would suddenly burn. It's best to start an hour or more ahead of time and just do the hot water prep.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great product. It is very slightly sweet and tastes strongly like coconut. The consistency is a bit gritty or grainy due to part of the coconut flesh that is powder and has been reconstituted, but I found that fine, not off-putting at all. It's great all by itself, added to smoothies, or put into the freezer in molds for a whole foods raw candy.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****
4882	3	Salty almond chocolate bars are my very favorite combo, so I was very excited to try this Scharffen Berger bar. My past experience with Scharffen Berger was always excellent, and I expected the same here.<br /><br />While it was a tasty enough bar, it was nothing exceptional or that I'd recommend or buy again.<br /><br />The chocolate was fine, less creamy than I'd expect for milk chocolate, and a bit grainy, but with a full cocoa flavor. The almonds were just shreds and crumbs instead of the nice coarse chunks you typically find in a good salted almond bar.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't be embarrassed to share one, but no raves. It's about at or slightly below the quality of any of the 3oz bars you find at decent grocery stores, certainly not gourmet caliber, and not my first choice by a long stretch for a salty chocolate fix.
4883	5	Counted the # of tea bags on a whim to see if there really were 100. Nope....Only 90. I counted two more times just to be sure. It must be the VAT (Value Added Tax) kicking in on them because they are Irish. :)
4884	5	One of the the things I hate about buying snack food is most companies can not get the right amount of salt on to foods.<br /><br />That was not a problem here.<br /><br />Great flavor, nice sized packets.
4885	5	This particular coffee was one I was hesitant to get at first. When I tasted it at a friends house I thought it was awesome. Went on-line and pruchased it right away!
4886	1	Both my dogs love this product, but until the source changes from China I would recommend giving it a miss. Our precious pets deserve the best, and this is packaged and marketed like it is, but Chinese food products, and pet products in particular are potentially very dangerous.<br /><br />I threw out a half a bag when I read where it came from.
4887	2	Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is  imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west. <br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the  wet  packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).
4888	5	I have always liked flavored coffee, but often they are acidic or bitter with fake flavor. This coffee is very smooth (no bitterness) with a really rich chocolate scent.  Tastes great with a dab of cream :)  If you like chocolate and coffee, this is definitely worth trying, I know I will be getting more.
4889	5	It came good and fresh. Bottle is dark colored. But do keep in mind that this is cold pressed oil made from UNROASTED sunflower seeds, so it has some sunflower taste but it is pretty mild and its color is light. If you are looking for more rich taste for salad oil like in sunflower oil made from roasted seeds you would be disappointed.
4890	2	Please be very careful of this buscuit, it is too thin, a baby biscuit is supposed to be hard and melt upon contact and not be breaking off in chunks enough to choke the baby. Just the thin look was scary to me and was later confirmed.<br /><br />Looks more suitable to a toddler.
4891	1	forget the coconuts indeed! this product tastes mostly of sugar! if you like that sugary taste you should enjoy this...major disappointment.
4892	3	Though I have been eating this product for a couple of years and buying it locally, I had thought that buying in bulk would be cheaper and easier.  The first time I received the package, most of the chocolate bars had melted significantly. I decided to give it a second try, and though the summer melt took fewer bars, so far every bar has shown signs of beginning the process. I'll probably not give it a third try. Unfortunately, the product is not carried by many vendors around me, so I may be looking for another treat.
4893	4	I ordered this by mistake.  I wanted the seasoned rice vinegar not the one for sushi.  It isn't too bad, rather salty but that is probably what you need for a vinegar for sushi.
4894	5	My boys love these little cookies and the mini-bags are easy to take on the go.  I like that they are GMO-free as well as allergen free, including no soy!  Wish they were organic, but you can't have everything!  These are a must-have in our house.
4895	1	I feel it is almost irresponsible to NOT let people know the poor quality of this product. Look at all the bad reviews. Tasteless, gross and not a popcorn most people would eat even if it were free. That a major food company has this product on the market is hard to believe.
4896	5	I took a chance and bought 6 bags of these, and I was not disappointed!  I really like tofu and mostly like tempeh and seitan (depends on the preparation), but soy curls are most definitely my favorite  fake meat.   They are easy to prepare and can be used in a variety of recipes - from soups to tacos and fajitas to curries.  One the easiest and tastiest ways to prepare them is to reconstitute them (10 minutes), drain them, and then dump into a crock pot along with your favorite BBQ sauce.  4 hours later, you have amazing  pulled pork  that you can serve up on a bun or over rice.  When I made them this way, a few of my kids asked if I was *sure* they weren't eating meat.  :)  The texture is just right, and since they don't have much flavor on their own, they don't compete with the flavors you pair with them (as I find seitan does, for example).<br /><br />I honestly can't imagine anyone not liking soy curls.  They are just amazing!
4897	1	I ordered this on February 18th and have yet to receive despite 'in stock' status. I dont see any link to contact with regard to the order, so I thought I'd write a review. Perhpaps I'll see them by summer!
4898	4	It's been a while since I've enjoyed a flavored coffee. I'm something of a purist and honestly, most flavored coffees taste artificial and over-done to me.  But Starbuck's has come through with a very natural-tasting vanilla-flavored coffee for coffee drinkers who want a bit more without the addition of a sugary syrup.<br /><br />The scent of the coffee is a nice vanilla-coffee blend with the vanilla more understated than I'd have expected. As it brews, the scent of vanilla rounds out the coffee aroma without ever overpowering it.  And the cup is smooth and almost velvety, pretty much all you could hope for from this sort of blend.<br /><br />I'm not saying they've won me over to the flavored coffee camp, but I will say that this is a cup of coffee I can respect in spite of the addition of a flavor. If you love vanilla coffee but hate artificial flavors, give it a try.  I think you'll be pleased.
4899	5	I am a great fan of ginger and I love it in everything from teas to stir fries.  These wonderful Altoid mints combine the best of both world (mint and concentrated ginger flavoring).  They soothe your stomach, freshen your breath and just make you feel happy!  I love these.
4900	5	Outstanding. Considering its not being steeped for minutes at a time. Great flavor. I will definitely buy again and again.
4901	5	We are on a special diet and there are very few bars that are healthy and have no ingredients that are bad for us.  This is one of them.  This is also incredibly delicious.  My husband, who has a lot of trouble chewing, says these bars are so good he doesn't mind the effort it takes to eat one!<br /><br />I've ordered these twice, but now that hubby has found out how good they are we might be ordering 2 boxes at a time in the future.<br /><br />If you want a quick pick-me-up snack that is healthy and tastes better than most candy, try these!
4902	5	I've been using this product for the past few months and I've seen a difference in my health. It makes me more calm in stressful situations and it keeps me regular. I love the taste - it's just like drinking raspberry soda on a daily basis!
4903	2	As other reviewers have pointed out, I am also disappointed in the reformulation of this product and in the fact that the company didn't properly disclose this information. I buy this in bulk for personal use and, as others, also thought for a minute that I got a shipment of expired or spoiled product. To clarify, both the taste and the consistency have changed from before. The product is now thicker and overall tastes closer to typical protein drinks which for my personal taste is a letdown. There are dozens of other protein drinks on the market and this one had a distinctive taste and consistency that are now both gone. I will look for a replacement, since this is part of my daily diet.
4904	1	I had high hopes for this popcorn, but was really disappointed. It has a very strong fake apple taste, which overpowers any caramel (and there wasn't much)that might be in the bag. The picture on the bag makes it look like there's caramel coated popcorn in there, but there's not, the three or four pieces like that and they have an even stronger fake apple taste. I guess there's really no such thing as good tasting light caramel popcorn!
4905	3	While I love Michael Season's Products and especially the Baked Cheddar Cheese Puffs and the Sweet Barbeque Potato Crisps, it was a little disconcerting to get a box that was half full of cheddar cheese curls.  They are not a favorite and there was nothing that I saw that indicated that any curls would be included in the package.  So needless to say, I was a little disappointed with my order.
4906	1	This is a good decaf coffee, but I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. It's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess.
4907	5	I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is  store fat!  Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the  during taste  either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!
4908	4	As a vegetarian and a runner, I needed to find a protein bar that would be suitable for my dietary needs, as well as decent-tasting and as natural as possible. Enter: The Simply Bar! No GMOs (whew!), vegan, and pretty good nutritional stats! Low calorie, low fat, and high protein, to keep you satiated! And chocolate and peanut butter--can you GET a better combo? I highly suggest you pick up a box. The price is pretty high, but they're worth it, as more of a once-in-a-while treat, if you're watching your wallet :).<br /><br />#glutenfree #vegan #healthy #proteinbars
4909	4	Apparently the company uses very thin material for their cans as every can in the case, including interior to the case, were dented.  Fortunately non of the contents was compromised and the pumpking itself was excellent.
4910	1	Price:  $29.98<br />Sale:  $13.20<br />You Save:  $16.78 (56%)<br /><br />What? For one tiny single itty bitty TEN OUNCE can. I got burned once this way, never again.
4911	3	I was sceptical about this product because it tastes like no other unsweetened cranberry juice I've ever tried. Its syrupy, sweeter than other cranberry juices and has a grape juice taste to it. I contacted Dynamic Health and they say its 100% cranberry juice. I still feel a bit sceptical though. I'm used to Tree of Life brand so I think I'll just go back to it.
4912	5	I use this in all my baking it is great, I love the large container, because I am a Chef and go through it fast. This gives that  well rounded flavor to all my sweet endings
4913	3	This is not the best turkey jerky I have had, but for the price is is worth it and I may re-order. This company also sells beef jerky, which is way too sweet and poor quality and processed. The turkey jerky is not nearly as bad as the beef. It has thicker pieces and is not as sweet. Because the price for this turkey jerky is pretty low, it makes it worth it, but it could be improved by being less sweet. It's not as bad as he beef, but still too sweet. Texture and meat quality were good, but not excellent.
4914	4	People please keep in mind that the Mocha means Indonesian and Ethiopian bean blended coffee.  It is not a Mocha Chocolate as some are used to.  It is usually named MOKA JAVA.  Still a great cup of coffee for a Moka Java blend of coffee.  Usually of the light variety, it is quite close.
4915	5	I buy these in bulk because I love them that much. I keep the box in my room at school and just take one or two when I'm off to classes so that I can have something to eat while I'm taking notes. It really helps me focus. Also, these suckers are really just that good. Some people have commented that they're funny shapes and stuff like that... well they're supposed to be randomly shaped. That's the nature of the suckers. Each one is different. Each one has a different amount of caramel or apple sucker. Some are more caramel than apple sucker. Some are more apple sucker than caramel. That's just how they're made.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
4916	1	Altoids wintergreen mints were once my favorite flavor of altoids. They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list  color (blue 1)  in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.<br /><br />July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color  blue 1 , which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!
4917	5	I reviewed the Spicy Buffalo flavored Wheat Thins after buying all three including Smoky BBQ and haven't given a second thought to buying any other salty snack. Zesty Salsa and the others really hit the spot for snack cravings with quite tasty and true to taste flavoring and not fake or stale as most flavored snacks are except of course Doritos. All three including this one are very fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt.<br /><br />I'm addicted to all three of them.
4918	1	I ordered this recently. The sugar-free has so much sweetener in it that it literally turns my stomach. I never put more than 3 squirts into 6 cups of coffee and milk. The flavor is absolutely missing and overpowered by the sickly sweet syrup.
4919	5	I fell in love with this Coarse grain salt after a trip to Hawaii this year. I switched to Sea Salt for everyday use a couple of years ago but continued to use Lawry's Seasoned Salt for a bit of punch. This is the only salt I use at the table now.<br /><br />Its a combination of Alae'a and Rock Salt with a soft peachy orange color to it. The coarse grain adds a bit of crunch.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find it listed with Amazon at an affordable combined price for 3.
4920	5	This pumpkin spice is a must have for the holidays!  The flavor and smell says it all.  I have to get it before Thanksgiving and keep it on hand all the way through Christmas.<br />[...]
4921	5	Whole Grain Fusilli with Veggie Marinara microwaved in 60 seconds is al dente pasta and tasty marinara, so yummy and quick! Discernible pieces of tomato, zucchini, bell pepper, carrots, onion and eggplant make a tasty Marinara sauce. It's neither too sweet nor acidic, just right for my personal preference. But it made me crave sausage and/or meatballs lol. The 60 second microwave time delivers firmer, al dente, 51% Whole Wheat Fusilli. Add a teaspoon of water and another 30 seconds in the microwave delivers a softer pasta. Only 320 calories for the 9 oz serving!<br /><br />The 2-stage plastic film venting and removal is a bit tricky. The unique packaging separates the pourable sauce cup from the pasta so it doesn't get soggy/squishy while cooking. Follow the directions AND steady the container or be prepared to clean spilled sauce.  This item is not something I'd just put on the pantry shelf without explaining the cooking process to my non-instruction-reading offspring.<br /><br />Really disappointed Amazon Prime doesn't currently have this in stock; I'd order it for my lunch/dinner this week. The current available offerings are cost prohibative...it's really good but not worth $40-ish expenditure!
4922	4	THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR THE PRICE...ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING IT COMES RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR...PLUS MY SHI TZU LIKES IT ON OCCASION
4923	5	My wife and oldest son don't like a strong coffee, so the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend works great for them. While I myself prefer the Coffee People's Organic, which is darker and more robust - similar to some of the blends found at Starbucks (not their regular blend). The Organic is strong enough for them to re-use once, after I've had the first brew.<br /><br />I also love that we can get the double pack of the Breakfast Blend 24 K-Cups inexpensively from Amazon. We purchase the Coffee People Organic in the 50-K-cup boxes.
4924	5	Awesome product for hours of entertainment for my dogs. I have several dogs, but bought this specifically for my pug. He pushes it around for quite awhile. It didn't take him long to figure our that flipping it usually brings a reward. He seems disappointed when he flips it and there aren't any morsels on the floor, but he keeps at it. Great Product!
4925	5	When I was a kid my parents used to have these Sesame Honey Crunch candies in our house and I loved them so much!  As I grew up I forgot about them until recently it came up in conversation at a family party.  I ordered a bag of these Sesame Honey Crunch and they are just as delicious as I had remembered!!  I shared them with my family and now we are all addicted to them AGAIN!!  I regularly order these!
4926	4	The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.
4927	2	I bought the 15 oz bag of Amport Foods Pine Nuts at Sams Club.  Although they taste good when you eat them, everything else taste like you have a mouthful of coins for about 3 days after you eat these nuts.  I ate just a handful of them and three days later I still had metal mouth. I returned these to Sams and told them they should drop this brand until they stop sourcing them from China/Asia.<br />The European, American, and Mexican pine nuts don't have this problem. Although these pine nuts are cheaper, they are not of value since they have this awful side effect.
4928	2	I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.
4929	5	We've tried many different K-Cup blends, but this one by far (or, rather, so far) is our favorite.  We like a bold taste and Emeril's is both bold enough and flavorful.  Newman's Special blend was our previous favorite, but this far outshines it, I believe.
4930	5	Since I cannot eat sugar, and there are so few healthy options out there, this is perfect for my chocolate fix!
4931	4	This Peanut butter is REALLY good.  If you've been eating the high sugar PB's, it may take a minute to readjust your tongue.  But, frankly, a PB that I don't have to stir!?!  ROCK ON!  Now for the Kosher thing, being Kosher is more than just  paying a Rabbi to bless the food.   There are rules for how it is prepared (check out [...] for details).  So, get over that and accept that Skippy took some extra steps, which, in the grand scheme of things, does not drive up the price of a jar of peanut butter!
4932	5	I dont often write reviews, but I will have to say that I love this Salame.  I live in Virginia and you cannot find it here, but I order it and it ships from Sacremento, CA.  The shipping works fine, I never question if the product has gotten spoiled while in the mail as I get it quickly and I just have had no issues.  I will continue to order this....
4933	5	Liked Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dog Treats, roasted chicken. My dogs liked this and considered it as a treat. They seem to run about a bit better too.
4934	5	Obviously if you're reading this you've probably already had M&M's - so don't let that stop you from buying this package!  I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.  They last for a while - though not as long as they should - in my house, but I'll keep ordering them as they are a delicious treat.
4935	2	I love bold, robust coffee and decided to purchase Green Mountain Dark Magic k-cups. Definitely a bold coffee, but so acidic it's not enjoyable. Severely disappointed in this coffee. Am trying other brands but because of this experience trying to steer clear of all coffees distributed by Green Mountain; and that's a shame because they offer so many choices. Money is too hard to come by to blow it on coffee you can't drink!
4936	4	Slightly expensive biscuits but Kids love them because they are really sweet.  The adults love them too! Very fresh and crispy.
4937	4	These are definately worth trying!  No, it is not EXACTLY like real pasta.  The slightly fishy smell (like miso soup/japanese food/seafood)goes away after rinsing.  The texture is slippery and unique--its not bad but you probably won't want to eat these plain.<br /><br />First drain the noodles, put them in a bowl of fresh water and microwave them for 1-2 minutes.  Drain the water and pat try, then add your sauce and heat a little bit more until warm.  If you are following the Hungry Girl recipe, add slightly more parmesan cheese and  the laughing cow  soft cheese (I love the french onion flavor).  Season with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and cayenne pepper.  It is absolutely declicious and only 100 calories for a big bowl of noodles!
4938	5	My wife picked up a canister of Gerber's Graduates Lil' Crunchies (Cheese flavored) and they were an instant hit with our one-year-old boy. Now we always have cans sitting around in the house and car. When he gets whiney, a Crunchy will almost always catch his attention. He loves them!<br /><br />In shopping around, we find that the Crunchies are available in a variety of flavors, but our boy always greatly preferred the cheese variety, so we continued to purchase them. Then, one day we found the Cinnamon Maple variety and decided to pick up a canister. Wow! They really hit the spot! He begged for more, even more than for the cheese ones. Mmmmm yum! OK, now we have another kind around in addition to the cheesy ones.<br /><br />Personally, I don't see what the big attraction is. They're nice and light-crunchy and practically melt in your mouth. They taste slightly like a very lightly flavored cinnamon roll with a slight emphasis on the cinnamon. If it were my choice, I'd favor the cheese variety.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
4939	5	It's true, I can't find it anywhere, but I visited a teeny town in Maine in 2005 and they had it! Our local Walmart used to carry it (nc) but hasn't for 4 years. But I'd rather just buy it this way and get as much as I want! This is the best, so much better than Kraft original. :)
4940	4	I would give it 5 stars but deducted a star due to questionable quality. There were white spots all over the sweet potatoes which worried me as they looked like bacteria or something. I emailed the company and they told me that they had already tested it in a lab and it was found to be starch, which occurs naturally on sweet potatoes. But I still feel uneasy about giving it to my dogs. Why wouldn't they post this info on the bags then?????
4941	5	good coffee for a french press.make it as strong or lite as you like it
4942	5	I bought a small package of this some time ago as I was having trouble finding something to hide their meds in (both cats and dogs). They love this stuff!<br /><br />They haven't gotten bored with it, or learned that I sometimes bury their meds in it.  Works way better than pill pockets, pieces of cheese, peanut butter, or even a bit of roast chicken. When using it to hide meds, it's easier to soak a piece in a little broth. The pill doesn't have to be completely hidden, just kind of indent it in a bit, let the dog smell that treat and he'll gobble it right down.<br /><br />Also, there are always crumbs and bits at the bottom of the package that I sprinkle on their dog/cat food and they seem to enjoy that a lot - one of my dogs won't eat anymore unless he's got the chicken crumbles on his food.<br /><br />I'm completely sold on this product.
4943	5	We are tea drinkers and drink multiple cups of tea in a day. Dilmah Earl Grey is one of the finest teas in the market and we kid you not. This is the only 100% pure Ceylon single origin tea available in the market at this time. We have tried several other items of this brand - Ceylon Supreme, Orange Pekoe and Green Teas and they are by far several times better tasting and refreshing than any other brand. We just read in an article that Dilmah Earl Grey has twice the amount of Antioxidants than Bigelow Earl grey as Dilmah Teas are packed fresh and at source.<br /><br />Our entire family is just truly hooked on Dilmah. The key to any Artisinal and traditionally manufactured tea is to brew it properly for min 3 minutes or the taste profile will not come and the tea will stay light. The cheap brands use a method called CTC (Cut-twist-Curl) which gives an instant color but lack the soul of the tea, which is flavor and of feeling refreshed.<br /><br />There are multiple reviews on Dilmah Brand on Amazon and no one has rated the particular item or the brand as the previous reviewer.
4944	5	Not only is this a pretty tea it's deliciously fruit-like flavor is just the brink of this healthy tea. If you are looking to lower your blood pressure, this is the wonder tea. I like to make it in my glass teapot with an infuser. I add fresh lemon slices, fresh mint, fresh stevia and slices of fresh ginger. Yum!!
4945	4	I buy mine for about $1. This is a very easy, quick lunch. It's a little salty for me but I still like it.
4946	5	Folgers Brazilian Blend Ground Coffee is a medium blend coffee that is one of my favorite coffee's for my morning wakeup. We have the Kuerig K-Cup coffee brewer and bought a couple of Solofill Refillable Single Serve Filter Cups for Kuerig Brewers from amazon so as to be able to use ground coffee from different manufacturers at a much cheaper price per serving. I like my coffee black and I find this coffee has a good taste which does not leave a bitter or an acid after-taste in your mouth. The coffee also has a pleasing aroma. I find that this 27.8 ounce tub will last two months with using between one and two cups of coffee a day.
4947	5	These are about the tastiest pickles on the planet. Especially the spicy ones. They're the perfect size and perfect crispiness - without all the preservatives nor colorings. YUM
4948	5	I love my Keurig mostly because I love flavored coffee and my husband doesn't.  I am always looking for new flavors and came across this flavor and with so many positive reviews, how could I go wrong?  You can't!  It smells wonderful while brewing and taste just as good!  My only complaint is that I was disappointed that I didn't have blueberry muffins when it was done, so were my kids!
4949	5	these green mountain k cups are great tasting with my favorite breakfast blend and its very conveninet and the best k cups for me that we like will buy again
4950	5	I recently got PetSafe Lickety Stik for my dog, and she loves it!  The product consists of a bottle filled with a flavored liquid, and whenever Tiny wants some all I have to do do is shake the bottle, remove the cap, and let her lick at the roller until she's satisfied.  There are times when she tries to bite the bottle, but I usually solve that by completely upending it so that she can't get her mouth around it.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a treat for your dog that's low on messiness as well as being something that they'll enjoy, then PetSafe Lickety Stik is a good one.
4951	5	i take these with me everywhere!  my toddler and my young one both love it.  most of the time, its messy-free unless the young one squeezes it everywhere.  it taste great!!
4952	5	First time when I was 13 years, I like the taste of this real fruit candies, but I don't know it still exists, found it 1 month ago.. now at the age of 32 I still like this fruit candies.. very tasty gums. YUMMY!
4953	5	I love garlic pepper and none of the stores near me carry it.  I was thrilled to find a decent price for this product online so I can cook with one of my favorite seasonings.
4954	5	I picked this chew because it has no ingredients that are unhealthy or irritate dogs with allergies.  I'm glad I did because i just saw the thing on the news about greenies maybe killing dogs because they dont break down and block up dog's digestive tracts.  I'd avoided other dog chews because the ingredient lists on them were full of chemicals i couldn't recognize.  The terrabone treats break down easily in water (so they will in my dog's stomach) and my dog just adores these treats.  I feel good because they arent high sugar or full of ingredients that would be bad for her teeth.  I havent ordered this treat yet from amazon but am glad to see I can because its very hard to find treats this perfect at local stores.
4955	5	I've had a subscription to Peet's for years. I find Starbuck's dark roast tastes burnt. I saw this coffee in the Gold Box and decided to try it based on the reviews.  It is absolutely delicious; the best coffee I've ever had.  I enjoy it in my morning latte.  It has a strong, robust smell, but blends smoothly in my latte's and mocha's.  Even better, it is ORGANIC and FREE TRADE.  How good can it get with the low price per pound and free shipping with Amazon Prime.  Closed my subscription from Peets and buying Dark Horse from Amazon from now on.  I LOVE IT!!!
4956	5	Amazing taste! I have a severe allergy to Peanut Butter and miss PB sandwiches so I decided to try this and I love it. Granted it has been two years since I have had PB. But the flavor of Sunbutter is great. Very satisfied. Now maybe they will make something like a reeses. LOL
4957	4	To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words  Medium Extra Bold  in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.
4958	4	I remember growing up with pork chops done with Shake N Bake and they were the best!  We don't do pork very often so when I saw this I had good memories of my childhood kitchen and tasty chops.  We had 4 pork chops just shy of half an inch and used about two-thirds of the package.  So, it should be able to cover up to six pork chops as the instructions state.  One thing I have to admit, unless you cook them way longer than stated, you'll have juicy, tender, pork chops with Shake N Bake!  As expected, they were juicy, but the flavor isn't as wonderful as I remember.  Not sure if that's because I have an adult's palate now or if the seasoning is lacking in the newest version of Shake N Bake.  I have made it other ways in the past for more flavor (brush with brown mustard and add rosemary to the shake n bake) and may try it again.  But, it's still a great quick meal for those nights that we're in a rush.
4959	5	My dachshund is a powerful chewer for a 20 pound dog.  Although he loves any good chew toy (and especially one he can tear up and spread around the house), the Nylabone DuraChew Double Bone Bacon in the Wolf size is the only one he will select first every time and will stay with the longest.  It lasts longer than every other chew toy I've purchased.  The only drawbacks I see are the price -- in many stores they sell for over $12 each -- and the fact they seem to go on backorder regularly in those stores where they are discounted.
4960	5	I purchased a loaf of gluten free bread--using cardboard would have as good.  I made gluten free bread from scratch.  The flavor was fine but it just did not have that bread texture.  This morning I made a loaf of Pamala's bread and it was wonderful!  It was so good I kept thinking  Is this really gluten free?   I now feel that a gluten free life won't be too bad.
4961	5	My hats off to Candy Express. These are the best dried peaches I have ever seen and eaten. Large, flavorful and delicious. In the past I have always purchased my dried fruits at Trader Joes, whose products are excellent, but these are better. I will definitely buy again.
4962	5	It tastes good. On the sweet side, but definitely delicious. But something I didn't see in the description is that this bag has 100 calories per serving, whereas the  peppered  and  old fashioned  flavors only have 80 calories per ounce. If you don't care about the calories, then this is definitely tasty and you should buy it, but if you want less calories (1200 calories per bag vs 960 calories per bag) than  peppered  or  old fashioned  might be better choices.
4963	5	I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.
4964	3	Please note that these pods are not compatible with Tassimo single cup brewers even though they are presented with a Tassimo t-disk search.
4965	3	Our dogs wouldn't eat this food unless we put wet canned food<br />mixed in with it, although a stray neighborhood dog would.
4966	5	After my dog smelled this treat lke 3 times, he finally ate it and now he really likes it! Its really great, I love that I know its healthy and not bad for my dog! It has a slit in the middle so you can break it in half, making it 650 treats(somewhere around that number)...its a great deal! I love to give it to my dog after he goes on a walk(like a little reward but its perfect because its not fattening (hes overweight!)
4967	4	I find the MiO Liquid Water Enhancer to be quite handy. It's the easiest way I know of to put together a glass of iced tea. I squirt this stuff, as an octopus squirts ink, into a glass of ice water, keeping in mind that a little goes a long way I stir and add until it resembles the tint of what I would expect a glass of tea to look like.<br /><br />The flavor is nice. Exotic ingredients are at a minimum: acesulfame potassium (Google for its interesting origin) is a sweetener. The rest is water, propylene glycol, malic acid, a couple more additives and some colorings.<br /><br />If you enjoy your tea sweet, this stuff replicates the flavor. I recommend MiO if the speed and convenience of simply squirting a concentrate into a glass of ice water seems appealing.
4968	5	It's white and it's asparagus. The taste is mediocre and the number of spears per bottle almost adequately serves four. What is unfortunate about this is that I was charged-by the vendor-the exact price of the product, $6.95. Far too much. This is a convenience not worth the price. If you can, buy Fauchon or Reese's both of which are far superior and offer far more for the price asked. If, however, you have no other access then this is, as I said, adequate. What I can say is that the product was perfectly packed. The asparagus is in a glass jar that is so cleverly contrived that I really believe it could be dropped from a plane and survive. Would I buy from MexGrocer again? Yes. Would I buy their asparagus, no.
4969	5	These are very tasty, filling with authentic flavors.  I eat them without the accompany yogurt sauce.  It is my go to fast food vegan meal.
4970	5	Very tasty - most peach-flavored drinks are really subtle, this one is a little stronger to me (or perhaps I didn't use as much water as recommended).  I have only tried this tea warm, haven't tried it cold yet but after reading these reviews I think I will.  I'm adding this one to my favorites!
4971	4	Nice number of cookies per box (i think its around 15). I am the only person who eats these in my household, and ive noticed if you dont put the box in a plastic bag, the cookies go stale within a few days. I would suggest buying the cookies in the 6 pack unless you have multiple ppl eating these within those few days!
4972	5	I find Larry's decaf espresso as good or better than anything I can find in a coffee house.  Espresso quality is quite variable when it comes to decaf.  I've ordered these beans 5-6 times and never been disappointed.  I grind the beans very fine in a small counter grinder, about 2 cups at a time.  I keep coming back for more and I've always found them available on Amazon.
4973	5	The Durkee Spices really are great. The crushed red pepper has an almost roasted aroma and taste. The heat is just about perfect. Used some as soon as I received it. I made hot mustard with it instead of grinding up peppers. Worked great !!<br /><br />Also with Durkee you know when the spices have been packed by the date code. Many others do not bother to put one on their packages.
4974	5	My dog is very picky, but he loves this green bone. The bone has 360 spike which can clean his teeth no matter which way he chew the bone.
4975	5	I have tried at least 30 different brands/flavors of cat food for my 4 year old cat who has suddenly become<br />picky.  This is the only flavor in the only brand he will eat.  He loves it.  It's all natural and safe.  Bought it on Amazon.  Finally!!![...]
4976	1	My cats took one smell and walked away.  Don't make the mistake of buying a case until you do a taste test with your cats.  They loved Fancy Feast Classic Seafood.  The don't eat the Fancy Feast gravy style food.  I can see why as the food is like soft rubber.  So, they are on Fancy Feast Classic.
4977	5	It was a little more spicy than I expected, but tasty!  Came quickly & was fresh.  Nice, large bag, good value for the money.
4978	5	My husband is a pretzel lover and has become addicted to these. I don't see the draw, being firmly in the potato chip camp myself, but to each his own. Our local stores only stock these occasionally, so he has tried all the other flavors, and while he does like the jalapeno, they don't like him back. It's nice to be able to buy them here and not have to run all over town looking for them.
4979	5	We have a Silver Lab who at 1 year old turned out to have a VERY sensitive digestive system -  like the dog version of IBS or Crohn's.  (perfectly health- except for this)  The ZEAL is a God-Send! All the symptoms vanished and our Labrador is his usual adorable,  playful, strong, smart self.  With our Vet's advice, we have had him on an elimination diet - as one would do for a human in the same circumstances.<br />We keep the food in a tight container and there is no fish smell. Of course there is slightly when you rehydrate it, because it's FISH based- LOL.  Better wild caught fish than chemicals and  unhealthy cheap food - for dogs or anyone.  I expect fish smell when I cook fish for us, so that's how it goes.<br /><br />Some pets (& humans) seem to have sensitivities and it is a great day when a PERFECT-4-US product/food plan  is found.  So this amazingly healthy food has our Labrador in Olympic-Good-Health. I give it every possible star. It is also good to know that the company has trial portions and you can phone them and ask for sample sizes  to see if your dog enjoys the food. That's how we started.
4980	5	This is my husbands favorite coffee and it is the best of all the breakfast blends.  Green Mountain really make some great well balanced coffees.  This one is perefct for those who do not like an over powering cup of coffee.
4981	4	I purchased this cereal from the Greenwise section of my local Publix.  It's a nice organic cereal with crunchy granola, crispy rice, and toasted oats.  I pay between $3.00-$3.99 per 17 oz. box.<br /><br />It's great to get it on sale but rare. You get a lot of cereal for your money as compared with other organic cereals which are typically 13-14 oz. per box.<br /><br />The cereal is hearty and saftisfying.  However, if you are in the habit of not consuming sugar the initial bowl can be a bit alarming.<br /><br />The cereal contains all organic ingredients:  whole grain oats, sugar, crisp rice (rice sugar, sea salt, malt), sunfolower oil, whole grain oat flour, molasses, maltodextrin, honey, sea salt, and vanilla extract.<br /><br />A serving size is 2/3 of a cup and the box contains 8 servings--that's a bit skimpy as most organic cereal serving sizes are typically one cup.  The fat content may be the culprit.<br /><br />Total fat per serving is 6 g and 42 g of carbs.  The sugar content is 14 g, 5 g protein, 3 g of fiber, and a mere trace of honey.<br /><br />However, to the credit of the manfacturer they didn't say it was a healthy cereal. It's organic and wholesome and full of flavors.  I give this cereal a 4/5 for flavor, 5/5 for maintaining organic integrity, and 5/5 for being Earth friendly (recycled packaging).
4982	3	After seeing this lemonade recommended in a health magazine I decided to see if it was as good as they said it was. After reading other's opinion I decided if it was that bad I'd have to try it for myself.<br /><br />I'm a fan of stevia. I drink stevia sweetened beverages all day long so I know what it is supposed to taste like. To me it is almost as good as sugar. The stevia used in this drink seems fine and didn't have an awful bitter taste. You can get various types of stevia and this one seems perfectly sweet.<br /><br />I think the problem with this  lemonade  is that it also has lime juice in it. That is what I'm tasting and it seems a little strong. In fact the aroma of lime seems to be what first hits your nose as you are about to take a drink. That seems to be a little confusing since you think you are drinking lemonade not limeade.<br /><br />The aroma aside, the lemon flavor is actually not bad but is very mild. Think more of a lemon water than a lemonade. If you drink this while holding your nose closed it tastes much better. If I was Honest Ade I'd take out the lime juice. I'd also like to know what  natural flavor  is. Is that a lemon or lime zest flavor? Maybe they could take that out too.<br /><br />A lemonade should taste pure like a summer day. I feel that in making this they are trying too hard to be different. Please Honest Ade - make this just with lemon juice. I make my own lemonade all the time with just straight lemon juice and a packet of stevia and it tastes better than this. I'm giving this a three because it is not as bad as I expected. I just don't like the aroma and the acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
4983	3	Since it is from the same maker as the popcorn popper it is the right, amount, and convenient, but mostly it's just salty.
4984	4	I really like this coffee. Very favorful and appreciate I can purchase it here as I cannot find it in the stores.
4985	4	it was great to find this caribbean cake here. Its truely a real caribbean rum cake. i was in puerto rico only 3 weeks ago for 10 days and I could not find a caribbian cake anywhere. Thanks to Amazon.
4986	5	This fruitcake will dispel your old ideas that fruitcake is dry and distasteful! It is delicious---all it is advertised to be!
4987	4	I had read a lot of great reviews about this food. My kitty has had a lot of dry spots around her head that cause a lot of itching since I brought her home from the shelter. At first, I thought this had been related to the flea infestation she suffered from when originally brought to the shelter. When it did not go away after a few months, I decided to switch her food to something organic. Spot's Stew for Sensitive Cats in the seafood flavor was my first stop. Although Jemima loves the flavor, the dry spots on her head and neck region continue.<br /><br />This food does seem to have an appeal flavorwise. She started wanting to eat a lot more when I switched her to this. Clearly, she must love seafood more than a chicken and rice blend. With the exception of her skin still being excessively dry with the sore spots, her coat is gorgeous and she has not had any issues with throwing up.<br /><br />Jemima recommends this for organic snobs like herself.
4988	5	I have purchased this item a few times and love it! Its better than any other brand I have found for sure. We also use it on lots of other things besides steaks. I have used it on pork, chicken, veggies, etc. Wonderful flavors and not super salty like some of the other brands.
4989	5	OMG!! It was the most delicious spread I have ever eaten!  I like that it is organic too. Palm oil in the other brand is not heart healthy in the long run. Nocciolata wins my love it vote!!  I like to eat it out of the jar with a spoon or mix it with peanut butter in a sandwich, awesome!! :-) I recommend this product over the popular supermarket brand.  It's really worth it!!!
4990	5	This stuff works. As reported by real doctors, do not use this all the time, only when needed.  Listen to what your body is telling you.
4991	5	Good coffee good price, a win win purchase. We have used this coffee in the past. When I saw the price and it was just rated as a Number ONE brand recently I thought why not purchase at Amazon, I could not do any better any where else. It worked out really nicely and I have a good cup of coffee now every morning.
4992	1	We just made our first loaf in our 2 lb breadmaker (which usually produces awesome loaves of bread).  The bread never rose.  It turned out to be a very dense, 1/2 sized loaf with a horrible texture on top.  After reading our breadmaker trouble-shooting suggestions, I have to wonder if the yeast was old or the flour was old.  We'll try it again (since we still have 3 bags) but so far we are completely disappointed.
4993	3	I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K >Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI >Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find  burnt , and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href= http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G >Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars.
4994	5	You have to try it to know how good this one is.  I'm not a huge fan of the Starbucks brand overall but I think this one is great and I always have it in stock.
4995	5	To be honest, I haven't tried these, but if my dogs could type, they would give this stuff 10 stars.<br />Just noticed from doing this review that this stuff may be made in China?  If so, I won't buy again.
4996	5	Easy to make.  Add water, egg whites and chocolate chips.  Way cheaper than buying the already-made type.  I use the silicone baking cups so they come out beautifully.  I put them in the freezer and just pull one out when I want a snack!  Can't beat it for the price! Only 1 Weight Watcher point!
4997	5	The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Dinner is one of the most easiest yet filling meals that I've made in a while. The product uses a creamy cheese rather than the powdered cheese found in other products and this makes a big difference in the taste the seasoning was perfect and I only had to add a small amount of my own seasoning to help. I added some grilled chicken breast strips that I use for my salads and this made the preparation that much simpler to prepare.<br /><br />The finished product has a great taste and if you add some steamed broccoli as a side dish and pop some dinner rolls in the oven then you have a perfect meal that is sure to be a hit with the family because my family really enjoyed this. Great Job Kraft!
4998	4	I have bought this coffee for years & it is excellent coffee.  However, surely Amazon has made a mistake on the price.  I agree with the other reviewer, this coffee can be purchased at Costco for 75% less.
4999	5	We read the reviews and took this coffee on a test run... We now have it on auto ship twice monthly..What more can I say :-)
